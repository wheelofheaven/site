What preceeds the Age of Capricorn is an Age of Aquarius of the preceeding Great Year. Before we get started with the first precessional Great Month, the Capricornian World Age, it is worth examining what led up to it. To illustrate what happened, we can take inspiration from a classic of the American film industry, Jurassic Park.</description></item><item><title>Age of Capricorn</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-capricorn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-capricorn/</guid><description>We start off with the Age of Capricorn first. The Age of Capricorn is the first precessional Month in the Great Year cycle. With the nominal period of 25'920 years for the precessional Year, the duration of one precessional Month is 2'160 years. During this period, the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox is aligned with the Capricorn constellation in the ecliptic.
Just as the orbital year, defined by the Earth&amp;rsquo;s revolution around the Sun, is divided into 12 monthly segments, the precessional Year, also known as the Great Year, is divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months.</description></item><item><title>Age of Sagittarius</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-sagittarius/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-sagittarius/</guid><description>The Age of Sagittarius lasts from –19'650 to –17'490 and follows the Age of Capricorn which lasted up to –19'650.
In the last chapter, The Age of Capricorn, we learned that a group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers managed to find an exoplanet that provided all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water. The planet they&amp;rsquo;ve found was covered in water and mist, and didn&amp;rsquo;t harbour any life at the moment of its discovery.</description></item><item><title>Age of Scorpio</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-scorpio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-scorpio/</guid><description>The Age of Scorpio lasts from –17'490 to –15'330 and follows the Age of Sagittarius which lasted up to –17'490.
In the last chapter, The Age of Sagittarius, we learned that the group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers who managed to find an exoplanet that provided all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water, studied the planet well enough to capitalize on its capacity to harbour life. The whole planet was covered in water, so they went on to build new outposts on the surface these oceans and kept studying and surveying the constitution of this new planet, especially its ocean and the bottom of it.</description></item><item><title>Age of Libra</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-libra/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-libra/</guid><description>The Age of Libra lasts from –15'330 to –13'170 and follows the Age of Scorpio which lasted up to –15'330.
In the last chapter, The Age of Scorpio, we learned that the group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers who managed to find an exoplanet that provided all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water, studied the planet well enough to capitalize on its capacity to harbour life. As soon as they managed to terraform a new barren continental land mass out of the bottom of the oceans, they went on to synthetize plant life.</description></item><item><title>Age of Virgo</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-virgo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-virgo/</guid><description>The Age of Virgo lasts from –13'170 to –11'010 and follows the Age of Libra which lasted up to –13'170.

Next they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish.</description></item><item><title>Age of Leo</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-leo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-leo/</guid><description>The Age of Leo lasts from –11'010 to –8'850 and follows the Age of Virgo which lasted up to –11'010.

After marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent.</description></item><item><title>Age of Cancer</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-cancer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-cancer/</guid><description>Fig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 8850 BC The Age of Cancer lasts from –8'850 to –6'690 and follows the Age of Leo which lasted up to –8'850.
Awakening # The serpent&amp;hellip; said unto the woman&amp;hellip; of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden&amp;hellip; ye shall not surely die, for Elohim doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be like Elohim.</description></item><item><title>Age of Gemini</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-gemini/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-gemini/</guid><description>The Age of Gemini lasts from –6'690 to –4'530 and follows the Age of Cancer which lasted up to –6'690.
From the perspective of Genesis and its seven Days of Creation, the Age of Gemini would represent the Eight Day. The number eight is encoded in the amount of people entering Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark: Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives, a total of 8 people.
The Age of Gemini is associated with the eighth day of creation and represents a time of new beginnings and fresh starts.</description></item><item><title>Age of Taurus</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-taurus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/intro/age-of-taurus/</guid><description>The Age of Taurus lasts from –4'530 to –2'370 and follows the Age of Gemini which lasted up to –4'530.
Peace in Heaven # The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.</description></item></channel></rss>
