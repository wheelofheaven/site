This 12-volume series is the first to be translated from a critical Aramaic text, based on original manuscripts. Matt&amp;rsquo;s extensive commentary clarifies Kabbalistic symbolism and terminology, citing sources from biblical, rabbinic, and kabbalistic texts. Acclaimed for its poetic language and insightful exegesis, the translation makes the complex Zohar accessible to a wider audience, both scholarly and general.</description></item></channel></rss>
