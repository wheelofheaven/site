The inception of this website traces back to last year\u0026rsquo;s autumn equinox. I was perched in a rooftop bar in Jerusalem, with the Old City stretching out before me in the east. From that moment to now, the content has burgeoned remarkably. I\u0026rsquo;ve dedicated considerable effort to refining the user experience of the site, and the wiki has been meticulously curated, almost to the limits of what a single maintainer can achieve. I\u0026rsquo;m optimistic that as the site garners more attention, others will join in, bringing their unique skills and knowledge to the table.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to shed light on the envisioned trajectory for the website. My penchant has always leaned towards an encyclopedic presentation of information. It\u0026rsquo;s paramount that complete transparency is maintained about the origins of the information. This empowers the reader to gauge the relevance and credibility of the information they encounter. This philosophy has been instrumental in shaping the content architecture of the website, from the introduction to the wiki, resources, and beyond.\n236'000 parasangs # I am mentioning this, because very recently, I was researching an intriguing passage from the Raëlian canon, namely where the canonicity of the Jewish Kabbalah was confirmed and a quote was provided which shows that the Kabbalah makes references to astronomical measurements, therefore implying that the scriptures are indeed alluding to being from a different solar system.\n\u0026lsquo;It is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.\nIf one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. Particularly noteworthy is a description in the Canticle of Canticles (5) of the creators\u0026rsquo; planet and the distance which separates it from Earth.\nIt is written that the \u0026ldquo;height of the creator\u0026rdquo; is 236,000 \u0026ldquo;parasangs\u0026rdquo;, and that \u0026ldquo;the height of his heels\u0026rdquo; is 30,000,000 \u0026ldquo;parasangs\u0026rdquo;.\nThis lead me to an article by the Jewish Virtual Library, a web repository of Jewish knowledge written in an encyclopedic format (something that we try to emulate here on Wheel of Heaven as well), titled \u0026ldquo;Shi’ur Qomah\u0026rdquo; (Hebrew שיעור קומה for the measure of the body [of god]). Therein, the height of the Creator is given as 236'000 parasangs, the number itself being based on a numerological interpretation from another Biblical passage, Psalm 147:5. There I had found my first clue this highly specific number had indeed been part of the Jewish Biblical exegesis and that the reference was obscure enough to acknowledge the unlikelihood of some uninitiated outsider (Raël) to have randomly picked up the signifance to weave together a new religious narrative out of thin air. Ultimately, this route of research led to a set of insights I will share here on Wheel of Heaven at a later point in time, once I have compiled it all together and written down the whole reasoning behind my research.\nWhat was more interesting actually, and that\u0026rsquo;s where we join together where Wheel of Heaven as a whole should be heading towards to in the future is the website that the Jewish Virtual Library was linking to when it came to its Biblical passages. These links resolved to a website I was up to that point totally unaware of. The real revelation was this hyperlink from the Jewish Virtual Library that introduced me to a previously unknown gem: Sefaria. Now, let me tell you one or two things about Sefaria.\nSefaria in a nutshell # Sefaria (www.sefaria.org) is a free online platform that offers an extensive collection of Jewish texts, both in their original languages and in translation. It stands out for its interlinked structure, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between primary texts and their commentaries. Beyond just being a repository, Sefaria encourages interactive learning. Users can annotate texts, create thematic source sheets, and even contribute translations. With its open-source model and a commitment to community engagement, Sefaria serves as a digital hub for Jewish scholarship, making it an invaluable resource for anyone delving into Jewish studies.\nIt got founded in 2011 by journalist Joshua Foer and Brett Lockspeiser, a former Google project manager. Envisioned as a \u0026ldquo;living library of Jewish texts,\u0026rdquo; the platform is open-source and relies on volunteers to contribute texts and translations. It offers a unique interconnected structure, linking various texts and providing them in their original languages, such as Hebrew, Aramaic, and Judeo-Arabic, alongside translations. Beyond its vast collection, Sefaria offers tools for users to create source sheets. The platform is overseen by a non-profit organization, employing a team of 18 engineers. By 2019, it attracted 250,000 unique visitors each month. The name \u0026ldquo;Sefaria\u0026rdquo; is inspired by the Hebrew words for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; (sefer) and \u0026ldquo;library\u0026rdquo; (sifria). Over the years, Sefaria has expanded its offerings, including a major redesign in 2016, the release of significant texts like the William Davidson Talmud in 2017, and a pilot program in 2020 to incorporate secular works.\nIt is precisely the last part that was so inspiring for me to consider, namely that this style of providing information can obviously be applied to any body of knowledge. In a way, the purpose of Wheel of Heaven is very similar in its goal-setting and tries to achieve to make a body of information as accessible as possible. Perhaps, cynics could argue that Sefaria at least is doing this for a valid field of research, Jewish scriptures, and Wheel of Heaven taps more into pseudoscientific realms, but in my opinion, this is secondary as what matters is that information independent of apparent value should always be provided in a transparent and traceable way.\nA similar goal # As I delved deeper into the intricacies of Sefaria, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but be captivated by its richness of content and highly user-friendly design. The platform\u0026rsquo;s seamless integration of vast textual repositories of ancient scriptures, parts of which have been quite difficult to get one\u0026rsquo;s hands on such an interlinear translation of the Talmud or even the Zohar, with the ability to switch language, as well as the specific translational work for a given language (and get this, even in Esperanto!) on the fly offers a unparalleled way of navigating the sheer amount of pages of ancient Hebraic scriptures with ease. I\u0026rsquo;ve honestly never found anything as uncumbersome to use. Sefaria truly reached new heights in terms of digital library software.\nAs already hinted at, one of the standout features in Sefaria is its interlinked structure. For a large amount of the scriptures available, an interlinear translation can be toggled on. Furthermore, every text, every commentary, every word is connected, allowing users to traverse layers of knowledge with just a click in the sense that personal notes can be read and third-party references are natively integrated into the reader view. This interconnected web not only aids in contextual understanding but also fosters a sense of exploration. For Wheel of Heaven, adopting a similar approach could revolutionize how users interact with content. Imagine a user reading about an esoteric concept and having the ability to instantly access related texts, interpretations, and discussions, all within the same ecosystem. Moreover, Sefaria\u0026rsquo;s annotation tools, which allow users to add personal insights, create thematic source sheets, and contribute translations, are a testament to the platform\u0026rsquo;s commitment to collaborative learning. Integrating similar tools into Wheel of Heaven could transform it from a mere repository to a vibrant community of seekers and scholars, collectively enhancing the body of knowledge.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of Sefaria, one that is being shared with Wheel of Heaven and that we can be proud of, is its open-source model. This democratization of code and content encourages community participation, ensuring that the platform remains dynamic and ever-evolving. For Wheel of Heaven, embracing a similar open-source ethos could catalyze community-driven enhancements, leading to a richer and more diverse content landscape.\nIt seems to me that now that I\u0026rsquo;m looking back to the last twelve months of development and content curation, Sefaria may very well serve as a beacon for the roadmap up ahead. As Wheel of Heaven continues its journey, drawing inspiration from such a pioneering platform will undoubtedly steer it towards becoming a digital sanctuary for its unique body of knowledge.\n"},{"id":"1","href":"/articles/the-great-year-and-its-twelve-houses/","title":"The Great Year and Its Twelve Houses","description":"The third key motion of the Earth next to the other two cycles responsible for the day and the year is what is known as the Great Year.

The original blog article can still be visited on his Gitlab Pages website: The Great Year and Its Twelve Houses | zara◇zinsfuss The Great Year # Whenever we want to understand our place in the universe, we gaze into the deep night sky, losing ourselves in the myriad of stars within our sight. It seems that the cosmic activities unfolding above us make up a grand narrative, of which we, the inhabitants of planet Earth, are merely a subscene.\nThus, it\u0026rsquo;s natural for any Earthly dweller to initiate inquiries about their location and significance in relation to the vast expanse of space and time.\nOur celestial understanding begins with acknowledging the three key motions of our planet Earth:\nRotation around its axis Revolution around the Sun Precession of its axis The first two motions are intrinsically part of our daily life as we experience their effects in tangible ways. However, the third motion, which will be our primary focus, is less remembered despite its significance. All three motions exhibit recurrent patterns, repeating over time, forming cycles each with a specific duration or period.\nEarthly Motion Period (approx.) Common name (1) Rotation 24 [h] Day / Night (2) Revolution 365 [d] Year (3) Precession 26'000 [y] Great Year The day-night cycle (1) is a result of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation and impacts life significantly. For practical purposes, we divide a day into two equal segments of 12 hours, aligning with the Circadian rhythm that regulates wakefulness and sleep for many mammals, including humans.\nThe second cycle, the year (2), is observable through the changing seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, especially in higher and lower latitudes. We typically divide the solar year into twelve parts, or months, each approximately 30.5 days long.\nThe lunar cycle, though not covered in detail here, is interesting to note. It occurs almost precisely 13 times in a year, with each lunar month lasting slightly over 28 days. This divergence between lunar and solar years leads to interesting questions regarding our calendar system.\nThe third cycle, lesser-known yet equally significant, is the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axial precession or precession of the equinoxes. Known also as the Great Year (3), it takes between 25,772 and 25,920 years to complete a full cycle.\nPrecession is a complex motion, difficult to describe without visual aids. For context, to show that we\u0026rsquo;re not making this up, let\u0026rsquo;s look at Merriam-Webster and how they define it the notion of precession:\na comparatively slow gyration of the rotation axis of a spinning body about another line intersecting it so as to describe a cone1\nIn the case of planets such as Earth, one needs to specify that ones means the so-called precession of the equinoxes. Britannica defines the precession of the equinoxes as follows:\n\u0026hellip; motion of the equinoxes along the ecliptic (the plane of Earth’s orbit) caused by the cyclic precession of Earth’s axis of rotation.2\nThe following figure elucidates axial precession, depicting the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation axis gyrating in a circular pattern:\nFig. 1 - Axial precession The direction of precession (circular arrow at the top) counteracts the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational spin (circular arrows around the globe). These conflicting rotations produce a peculiar dance in our heavens. For an Earth-bound observer, this means the daily dance of the sky against the constellations counterpoints the slow waltz due to precession across its 25,920-year cycle.\nThe implications of this precession are immense and serve as the bedrock of our understanding of time and astrological ages. As we journey through the Great Year, the backdrop of the stars shifts gradually. This cosmic shift, though imperceptible within a human lifespan, has profound implications over thousands of years.\nIn the next section, we\u0026rsquo;ll delve deeper into these ramifications, unravelling the astrological epochs that punctuate our celestial journey through the Great Year and their impact on our sociocultural evolution.\nThe Twelve Houses # With the understanding of the three key motions of the Earth, we recognize that these celestial rhythms provide an intricate frame of reference that enables us to conceptualize and measure time. These cyclical motions share several intriguing characteristics:\nDefinitive periodicity: These motions, untouched by human intervention, depict a recurrent cosmic choreography, repeating the same patterns in a rhythmic cycle that is bound to start again once completed. Consistency of time elapse: Because of this inherent periodicity, we can expect the exact same amount of time to elapse for a given cycle. This offers a degree of predictability and reliability unmatched by human-made systems. Granularity: The natural segmentation of a full cycle provides smaller, discrete units of time, enabling us to perceive time in digestible bites, rather than overwhelming, continuous stretches. These harmonious cosmic rhythms hold a profound sense of mystery and grandeur that exceeds our typical human scale of perception. Thus, using these celestial motions as a time-keeping framework becomes intuitively appealing, particularly because all three motions exhibit intervals that complement each other extraordinarily well.\nThe day, a product of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation, becomes a manageable unit to count a year, which in turn, stemming from the Earth\u0026rsquo;s revolution, offers a feasible measure to gauge the enormity of the Great Year, a result of precession.\nThis interlocking of time scales gives rise to an intriguing pattern: the division of the rotation and revolution cycles into 12 units each. This division, while seemingly arbitrary, has far-reaching implications when applied to the precession cycle or the Great Year.\nDividing the Great Year by twelve gives birth to a new time unit: the Great Month, each spanning a staggering 2,160 years. This unit embodies a vast stretch of time, dwarfing our conventional year and providing a measure for time spans that cross the threshold of millennia.\nThe concept of the Great Month offers a larger temporal framework that encompasses the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of cultures and ideas, and the progress of scientific understanding. It gives us a perspective on time that goes beyond our personal or even historical experience, reaching into a scale that we usually reserve for geological or astronomical events.\nJust as the daily and annual cycles are integral to our understanding of time, the Great Month could prove to be an essential tool for understanding longer-term trends and cycles. As our knowledge of our own (ancient) history, the constitution of planet Earth, and astronomical patterns continues to grow, we may find that the concept of the Great Month helps us make sense of patterns and events that span thousands of years, providing a broader context for understanding our place in the cosmos.\nThis broader framework of time, provided by the twelve houses of the Great Year, each a Great Month, enables us to comprehend vast stretches of time that would otherwise seem incomprehensible. It is a cosmic calendar that places our transient existence into a grand chronicle of the universe.\nMapping the heavens into constellations # As we continue our cosmic voyage, let\u0026rsquo;s pause to consider the age-old human practice of Earthly stargazing and the crucial role it has played in our understanding of the universe. As highlighted in the introduction, humans across cultures and epochs have turned their gaze upwards to the celestial theater, seeking to comprehend their position amidst the glittering array of heavenly bodies. This shared fascination transcends cultures, continents, and millennia, connecting us with our ancestors in a shared quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe.\nEarly humans not only marveled at the stars but came up with an ingenious solution to navigate this overwhelming cosmic map: grouping the multitude of visible stars into meaningful clusters known as constellations. This form of early science was not only practical but ingeniously symbolic, layering each cluster with a mythological tale. Through these storied shapes, abstract cosmic data took on a narrative quality, anchoring spatial patterns in the memorable tales of gods, monsters, and heroes. The storytelling aspect is arguably as crucial as the spatial one; it facilitated knowledge transmission across generations, allowing the wisdom of the past to enlighten the present.\nArmed with the ability to recognize these celestial patterns, humans could discern practical, actionable information, such as the timing of agricultural activities or navigation for long sea voyages. The constellations became our cosmic compass, guiding our way through the seasons and across vast bodies of water.\nYet, the stellar canvas is not static. As we just learned a few paragraphs earlier, the gradual progression of axial precession, despite its subtle nature, inexorably reshapes the constellations\u0026rsquo; arrangement in the night sky. This slow celestial dance, overlooked by casual observers, becomes apparent to those invested in careful, long-term celestial tracking. With axial precession taking approximately 25'920 years for a full cycle, a shift of 1° on the celestial sphere equates to a time span of 72 years, roughly aligning with an average human lifetime. Remarkably, this 1° shift is also closely proportional to the combined apparent diameter of the Sun and the Moon in our sky.\nSuch findings underscore the sheer complexity of observing and comprehending axial precession. Without efficient means for inter-generational persistence of empirical knowledge, the task becomes even more daunting. Yet, humanity\u0026rsquo;s enduring curiosity and capacity for pattern recognition have allowed us to pierce this cosmic mystery, using nothing more than our naked eyes and the night sky as a canvas for our stories and mathematical explorations.\nMarking Time: The Importance of Cardinal Days in a Year # Before we continue our cosmic journey, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to focus on another distinctive aspect of Earth\u0026rsquo;s annual journey around the Sun, influenced by the planet\u0026rsquo;s axial tilt of 23.44° in relation to its orbital plane. This tilt not only gives our planet its characteristic seasonal rhythm but also impacts how we perceive the Sun\u0026rsquo;s light throughout the year.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s delve a bit deeper into these astronomical concepts. The celestial equator is the projection of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator onto the sky, while the ecliptic is the apparent path the Sun traces in this celestial sphere due to Earth\u0026rsquo;s revolution. The celestial equator and ecliptic intersect twice a year at two specific points, marking the spring and autumnal equinoxes. These equinoxes signify the moment when the duration of day and night is equal across the globe. The spring equinox (also known as the vernal equinox) typically occurs on the 20th of March, and the autumnal equinox around the 22nd of September.\nConversely, the summer and winter solstices denote the moments when one hemisphere of the Earth experiences the longest day or longest night of the year, respectively. The summer solstice generally falls on the 21st of June, while the winter solstice occurs around the 21st of December.\nThese equinoxes and solstices - the cardinal days - are considered pivotal astronomical milestones in our calendar, marking the start of each season.\nCardinality Day in a year Perceptibility Vernal equinox ~ 20th of March Day and night of equal length Summer solstice ~ 21st of June Longest day in the Northern Hemisphere Autumn equinox ~ 22nd of September Day and night of equal length Winter solstice ~ 21st of December Longest night in the Northern Hemisphere Bear in mind that an equinox or solstice represents a specific moment in time when the celestial equator aligns with the ecliptic, not an entire day. Another way to define an equinox is the moment when the visible Sun\u0026rsquo;s center is directly over the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator.\nViewing Earth as a grand celestial clockwork, the cardinal days can be seen as markers for the four quadrants on a clock face. In essence, if we were to pick a moment to compare celestial measurements, the cardinal days, particularly the equinoxes, would be the most desirable due to their globally observable characteristics.\nAstronomical watchmaking # Navigating the intricate choreography of Earth\u0026rsquo;s three key motions - two of which present a rapid periodicity - is a demanding task, particularly when trying to discern the glacial pace of the third motion, the precession. Its slow, stately progression requires the observer to select a specific moment each year for stellar observation, akin to the interplay of distinct mechanisms within a mechanical wristwatch that work in harmony to accurately portray time. Just as a wristwatch employs a time reference, typically 0 or 12 o'clock, the Great Year also calls for a defining point of reference.\nTo construct our model of an astronomical timepiece, we need to consider specific reference points, namely:\nFirst motion [rotation]: Sunrise, which heralds the start of a new day Second motion [revolution]: Spring Equinox, marking the arrival of a new cycle of seasons Geographical point of reference: Due East, the direction from which the Sun makes its daily ascent By leveraging these sensible parameters to establish our \u0026lsquo;zero\u0026rsquo; point, we can now observe the celestial tapestry – the stars or constellations – unfolding against the backdrop of the Great Year.\nOne might then wonder, what constellation graces the pre-dawn sky on the spring equinox, rising in unison with the Sun due east, in our current era?\nFig. 2 - Vernal equinox on the 20th of March 2020 due east, taken with Stellarium As we look to the heavens, we find ourselves at the threshold of a cosmic shift, where the constellation of Pisces is giving way to the upcoming constellation of Aquarius. This celestial transition silently marks the passage of millennia, a grand celestial clock advancing into a new age. This is the precise moment where the ancient and the current converge, providing us with an invaluable glimpse into the cosmic shift into a new age. A new age that could have been easily predicted for millenia if the awareness and knowledge about axial precession were given.\nThe Cycle of Zodiacal Ages # Our prior assumptions about celestial observations and their correlation with the slow progression of the precession of the equinoxes were not arbitrary. This understanding is deeply rooted in antiquity. This exploration propounds that the Zodiac\u0026rsquo;s genesis is intrinsically linked to precession. The term Zodiac refers to a group of 12 constellations, whose mention transcends written history and cultural boundaries. Undeniably, the Zodiac and its derivative study, now known as astrology, have been of significance for thousands of years.\nThe oldest known civilization, the Sumerians, had profound respect and knowledge of the Zodiac. Linking the precession to the Zodiac is controversial, as it implies comprehensive understanding of the former, requiring considerable scientific knowledge including the concept of Earth as a globe. To attribute such cosmological insights to the earliest known civilization would challenge the contemporary consensus on known history, casting doubt on the linear and gradual narrative of human progress. Such a perspective could provide a basis for alternative narratives.\nReturning to the Zodiac, the term originates from Ancient Greek zōidiakòs kýklos (ζῳδιακός κύκλος) meaning _\u0026lsquo;cycle or circle of carved animals\u0026rsquo;3. However, in non-Indo-European languages, the Zodiac has different names. In Biblical Hebrew, the Zodiac is called Mazzaroth (מַזָּרוֹת), translating to \u0026lsquo;garland of crowns\u0026rsquo;↩︎. The phrase \u0026lsquo;mazel tov\u0026rsquo; (מזל טוב‎), wishing good luck or more accurately good fortune, derives from mazzaroth. In Chinese logograms, the Zodiac is referred to as 獣帯, meaning \u0026lsquo;animal belt\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Zodiac comprises 12 constellations, twelve signs. These twelve constellations are part of the ecliptic. This is no mere coincidence, as it is precisely the ecliptic which aligns with the celestial equator on the equinoxes (refer Cardinal days in a year and their importance).\nIf following the ecliptic on the equinoxes is indeed the correct method to track the precession\u0026rsquo;s progression, the Great Year, then the twelve constellations positioned along the ecliptic indeed represent the twelve houses or the twelve Great Months for a given Great Year. As we\u0026rsquo;ve established earlier, dividing the Great Year into twelve houses makes each house last 2'160 years.\nOne might wonder whether we have already transitioned into the Age of Aquarius or are still in the Age of Pisces. To answer this, one must first understand when the precessional cycle initially began, or more specifically, when a given house precisely begins or ends. Unfortunately, this isn\u0026rsquo;t easy to determine without significant assumptions. However, it is clear that as we progress through the early 21st century, the possibility of being in the new Age of Aquarius increases.\nAquarius is both a constellation and the twelfth of a circle known as a sign. Entering Aquarius means entering the period during which astronomers will see the sun rise in Aquarius on the day of the vernal equinox. The phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes is involved in this fact. The equinoctial sun has been rising in the sign of Aquarius since 1950. In this interpretation, we are in the \u0026lsquo;Golden Age\u0026rsquo; of prophecies. The equinoctial sun will not begin rising in the constellation of Aquarius until about the year 2700. In this interpretation, neither you nor I will see the prophesied \u0026lsquo;Golden Age\u0026rsquo;.\n\u0026ndash; Jean Sendy: Coming Of The Gods (1970), p. 69\nThe duration of a house could also be determined by the size of a given constellation in the sky. However, this would be a poorly defined assumption as the shapes of Zodiacal constellations vary greatly. Pisces, for instance, has a considerably large constellation, particularly in ecliptic length, whereas Aquarius is comparably short. There is a significant gap between these two constellations. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the duration of a Great Month is 2'160 years, mimicking the twelfth section of its parent year cycle. For reasons that may be highlighted in future discussions, the year 1'950 AD as the beginning of the Age of Aquarius appears to be our best assumption for now.\nBased on these assumptions, calculating the Zodiacal Ages backward by decrements of 2'160 years, we arrive at the following table:\nZodiacal age Time span``` ♑ Capricorn 21'810 \u0026ndash; 19'650 BC Sea goat, Mountain Goat ♐ Sagittarius 19'650 \u0026ndash; 17'490 BC Archer, Centaur ♏ Scorpio 17'490 \u0026ndash; 15'330 BC Eagle, Phoenix ♎ Libra 15'330 \u0026ndash; 13'170 BC Scales, Balance ♍ Virgo 13'170 \u0026ndash; 11'010 BC Virgin, Grain Goddess ♌ Leo 11'010 \u0026ndash; 8'850 BC Lion, Nemean Lion ♋ Cancer 8'850 \u0026ndash; 6'690 BC Crab, Scarab, Turtle ♊ Gemini 6'690 \u0026ndash; 4'530 BC Twins, Dioscuri ♉ Taurus 4'530 \u0026ndash; 2'370 BC Bull, Calf, Bison ♈ Aries 2'370 \u0026ndash; 210 BC Ram, Golden Fleece ♓ Pisces 210 BC \u0026ndash; 1'950 AD Fishes, Twin Fish ♒ Aquarius 1'950 AD \u0026ndash; 4'110 AD Water Bearer, Fountain These denote the World Ages of the past. Looking into the future, after Aquarius comes Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, and so on. The relevance of these ages extends beyond simply knowing the hour of a day, the day of a year, or the age of ages. Understanding precession and tracking it through ecliptic constellations allows us to position ourselves within larger timescales. It is a conventional way of referring to vast time spans surpassing mere years. If there\u0026rsquo;s anything worthy of measuring World Ages, employing the Earth\u0026rsquo;s third key motion, enabling millennia-long time references, is surely the most intelligent approach.\nIf our Earth\u0026rsquo;s inhabitants employed this understanding in the past, could we now comprehend what they might have meant when referring to world ages or aeons of time?\nEncoding # Past civilizations have not only known about the precession of the equinox, but they have also endeavored to preserve this sacred knowledge. This preservation occurred in two notable forms: language and constructions. Both these forms served as mechanisms of encoding that have carried this ancient wisdom through ages, allowing it to transcend the ravages of time and cultural shifts.\nHamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill # In 1969, a groundbreaking work was published that would provide an intricate insight into the encoded understanding of the precession of the equinoxes. This knowledge, the authors proposed, had its roots in an ancestral civilization characterized by a highly sophisticated understanding of the cosmos. This civilization, they claimed, had transmitted this knowledge through subsequent world civilizations, encoded within the rich tapestry of mythical images and narratives.\nThis remarkable study was conducted by Giorgio de Santillana (1902–1974), a professor of history of science at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hertha von Dechend (1915–2001), a professor of history of science, philosophy, and ethnology at the University of Frankfurt. Together they co-authored Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth.\nTheir book offers a revolutionary perspective, emphasizing the holistic and interconnected nature of archaic thought, and the profound role the celestial dynamics played in shaping their worldview. Let\u0026rsquo;s allow their words to elucidate:\n\u0026ldquo;To begin with, there is no system that can be presented in modern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are no principles from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes from a time when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, and it would be unfair to search for one. There could hardly have been one among people who committed all their ideas to memory. It can be considered a pure structure of numbers. From the beginning, we considered calling this essay \u0026lsquo;Art of the Fugue.\u0026rsquo; And that excludes any \u0026lsquo;world-picture,\u0026rsquo; a point that cannot be stressed strongly enough. Any effort to use a diagram is bound to lead into contradiction. It is a matter of times and rhythm.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The subject has the nature of a hologram, something that has to be present as a whole to the mind. Archaic thought is cosmological first and last; it faces the gravest implications of a cosmos in ways which reverberate in later classic philosophy. The chief implication is a profound awareness that the fabric of the cosmos is not only determined, but overdetermined and in a way that does not permit the simple location of any of its agents, whether simple magic or astrology, forces, gods, numbers, planetary powers, Platonic Forms, Aristotelian Essences or Stoic Substances. Physical reality here cannot be analytical in the Cartesian sense; it cannot be reduced to concreteness even if misplaced. Being is change, motion, and rhythm, the irresistible circle of time, the incidence of the \u0026lsquo;right moment\u0026rsquo;, as determined by the skies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.56\nSantillana and von Dechend challenge the modern perception of precession as a trivial celestial motion and invoke the grand vision our ancestors had towards this cycle. They argue that the precession, for our forebears, represented a majestic secular motion — a peg on which they hung their profound thoughts about cosmic time:\n\u0026ldquo;We today are aware of the Precession as the gentle tilting of our globe, an irrelevant one at that. As the GI said, lost in the depth of jungle misery, when his friends took refuge in their daydreams: \u0026lsquo;When I close my eyes, I see only a mule\u0026rsquo;s behind. Also when I don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rsquo; This is, as it were, today\u0026rsquo;s vision of reality. Today, the Precession is a well-established fact. The space-time continuum does not affect it. It is by now only a boring complication. It has lost relevance for our affairs, whereas once it was the only majestic secular motion that our ancestors could keep in mind when they looked for a great cycle which could affect humanity as a whole. But then our ancestors were astronomers and astrologers. They believed that the sliding of the sun along the equinoctial point affected the frame of the cosmos and determined a succession of world-ages under different zodiacal signs. They had found a large peg on which to hang their thoughts about cosmic time, which brought all things in fateful order. Today, that order has lapsed, like the idea of the cosmos itself. There is only history, which has been felicitously defined as \u0026lsquo;one damn thing after another.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.67-68\nThe authors take a step further to explore the fundamental divide between archaic and modern ways of interpreting the cosmos. They argue that the key to understanding archaic thought is through astrology, a cosmic language that encapsulated their profound sense of correspondences and deterministic principles:\n\u0026ldquo;The greatest gap between archaic thinking and modern thinking is in the use of astrology. By this is not meant the common or judicial astrology which has become once again a fad and a fashion among the ignorant public, an escape from official science, and for the vulgar another kind of black art of vast prestige but with principles equally uncomprehended. It is necessary to go back to archaic times, to a universe totally unsuspecting of our science and of the experimental method on which it is founded, unaware of the awful art of separation which distinguishes the verifiable from the unverifiable. This was a time, rich in another knowledge which was later lost, that searched for other principles. It gave the lingua franca of the past. Its knowledge was of cosmic correspondences, which found their proof and seal of truth in a specific determinism, nay overdeterminism, subject to forces completely without locality.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.74\nThe Language of Mythology # The authors posited that mythology, often overlooked as mere fanciful stories, served as a complex and subtle medium for encoding this ancient wisdom. These tales, spun with cryptic symbolism, were carefully woven tapestries hiding a coded language that mirrored the cosmos\u0026rsquo; movements and cycles. This language, unlike our contemporary scientific language, expressed relationships, patterns, and correspondences rather than explicit cause-and-effect relationships.\nThe second form of preservation, constructions, refers to the architectural marvels of the past, whose sophistication and precision in alignment with celestial bodies still bewilder modern researchers. These constructions - from the Pyramids of Giza to Stonehenge, and from the Mayan temples to the complex layout of Angkor Wat - all reflect an acute understanding of celestial mechanics and a desire to embody these cosmic rhythms in earthly form. They stand as colossal markers of a civilization\u0026#39;s understanding of the cosmos, aligning earthly and heavenly cycles into a harmonious, integrated whole.\nThe legacy of these ancient civilizations and their profound cosmic understanding continues to whisper its wisdom to us, hidden in the language of myth and the stones of ancient constructions. As we decode these messages and comprehend their significance, we might re-discover a worldview that paints a more connected, harmonious, and rhythmically flowing cosmos, echoing the complex symphony of the precession of the equinox. This understanding may invite us to reconsider our place in the cosmos, not as detached observers, but as participants in a grand, cyclic dance of celestial bodies and cosmic time.\nZodiacal Constructions as Time Markers # Archaeoastronomy, the study of how past civilizations understood phenomena in the sky and how they utilized this knowledge in their cultures, is a captivating blend of anthropology, astronomy, history, and archaeology. This discipline\u0026rsquo;s foundation can be traced back to key figures like Joseph Norman Lockyer (1836–1920), who is renowned for his discovery of helium. As the founder and first editor of the influential journal Nature, he took an avid interest in astronomical alignments in ancient buildings, even penning The Dawn of Astronomy - A Study of the Temple Worship and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians (1894)4, one of the earliest archaeoastronomical works.\nWhen discussing archaeoastronomy, it is impossible to overlook the Giza pyramid complex—an iconic example of ancient constructions that reflect a deep understanding of celestial bodies. The pyramids mirror a non-zodiacal star constellation, and there\u0026rsquo;s a statue known as the Sphinx, bearing a striking resemblance to Leo—the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac, possibly denoting the Age of Leo. The Pyramid of Khufu is of particular interest because of its ability to mark the day of an equinox. This feature is a testament to the extraordinary craftsmanship and scientific sophistication of the civilization that built it.\nThe Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid, has a unique eight-sided structure, rather than the four sides typically associated with pyramids. This design enables the sun\u0026rsquo;s light to mark the construction when the light comes from a direct, perpendicular direction towards a given side of the pyramid. Considering the Pyramid of Khufu\u0026rsquo;s precise alignment with the North, there are only two days in a year—the equinoctial days—when the pyramid can be marked as seemingly intended.\nA fascinating insight into the unusual design of the Great Pyramid comes from J.P. Lepre\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive work, The Egyptian Pyramids: A Comprehensive, Illustrated Reference (1990)5:\nOne very unusual feature of the Great Pyramid is a concavity of the core that makes the monument an eight-sided figure, rather than four-sided like every other Egyptian pyramid. That is to say, that its four sides are hollowed in or indented along their central lines, from base to peak. This concavity divides each of the apparent four sides in half, creating a very special and unusual eight-sided pyramid; and it is executed to such an extraordinary degree of precision as to enter the realm of the uncanny\u0026hellip;\nThe Great Pyramid was clearly designed and built with astronomical knowledge in mind, indicating equinoctial sunrises and sunsets and marking the progression of the precession6. Furthermore, there is evidence of Zodiac symbolism within the Giza pyramid complex. The Sphinx, a lion-like figure, faces due East, directly towards the rising Sun on equinoctial days. This position implies the Sphinx looks at the Zodiacal constellation hiding behind the Sun at these precise moments—does this mean it is a nod to the Zodiac sign Leo?\nFig. 3 - Photograph taken in 1940 by P. Groves (unverified) While this interpretation may seem conjectural, the more we learn about these ancient civilizations and their understanding of the cosmos, the more plausible it becomes. The law of Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor—that entities should not be multiplied without necessity—suggests that the more congruent factors we find in the construction of these monumental buildings, the more likely it is that this highly sophisticated astronomical knowledge has been applied universally.\nSumming It Up # The Great Year and its Twelve Houses have intriguing aspects that tie in closely with the Earth\u0026rsquo;s three key motions, particularly the precession. This slow westward shift of the equinoxes along the plane of the ecliptic, resulting from the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis of rotation, causes the equinoxes to occur earlier each sidereal year. A complete precession cycle takes around 25,920 years, marking the Great Year.\nThis Great Year can be divided into twelve distinct months or World Ages, each lasting 2,160 years and corresponding to one of the constellations on the ecliptic, specifically a Zodiac sign. From 1950 AD, Earth and its inhabitants entered the Age of Aquarius, also referred to as the Aquarian Age or the New Age. This understanding of World Ages seems to have persisted throughout history, encoded into folklore and monumental construction, which continues to inspire awe today.\nThis understanding of the cosmos that\u0026rsquo;s embedded in ancient structures such as the Giza pyramids implies a civilization far advanced for its time. This notion may not conform to the traditional narrative of human progress, but it increasingly aligns with the body of knowledge unearthed through archaeoastronomy. The advanced knowledge, as demonstrated by the construction techniques, and the remarkable understanding of celestial bodies, suggest the existence of a pre-flood civilization that had mastered the art of astronomical timekeeping.\nAstrological ages, as depicted in the Great Year and the Twelve Houses, provide a comprehensive chronology that has been utilized for millennia. These World Ages are not merely relics of the past, but they hold predictive power, serving as a celestial calendar of what\u0026rsquo;s to come. The progression from one astrological age to the next signifies both an astronomical shift and a sociocultural transition. Each age carries its unique character, influencing the zeitgeist and the course of human development.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fascinating to consider that these civilizations, thousands of years in our past, possessed an understanding of time that we are only beginning to fully appreciate. They saw time not as linear but cyclical, marked by the celestial dance of stars and planets. It seems that they understood the inherent rhythms of the cosmos and our planet\u0026rsquo;s place within it, a wisdom that they encoded into their greatest monuments.\nThis glimpse into the past serves not only as a testament to the accomplishments of these ancient civilizations, but it also invites us to see the future in a new light. As we move further into the Age of Aquarius, we might find that the knowledge held by our ancestors can guide us in navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. After all, the ancients viewed the cosmos not as a vast, empty space, but as a grand celestial clock, a timeless guide inscribed with the wisdom of ages past, present, and future.\nThe narrative presented here has been simplified for ease of understanding, but each topic warrants deeper exploration. Future write-ups will delve more deeply into each aspect, shedding more light on our ancestors\u0026rsquo; relationship with the cosmos.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Month Wiki › Great Year Wiki › Precession Wiki › World Age Read more # Intro › Timeline › Preamble Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius Merriam-Webster is a reputable and widely recognized American publisher known for producing dictionaries and reference books.

Discover the nuances of these key terms in our lexicon, helping to unravel the intricate narrative of the Elohim civilization.","content":" 👉 Disclaimer: This is a English-only article. Translating the premises of this article into languages with different ethnolinguistic characteristics. In the broad tapestry of ancient astronaut narratives, from the works of Jean Sendy and Zechariah Sitchin, through to the modern trend of interpreting biblical scriptures literally, as undertaken by scholars such as Mauro Biglino and Paul Anthony Wallis, a unique perspective emerges. On our website, Wheel of Heaven, we delve into one such perspective by contextualizing a new religious movement known as Raëlism, where the term \u0026lsquo;Elohim\u0026rsquo; assumes a pivotal role.\nThe Elohim # Elohim, a term stemming from the ancient Hebrew language, where it has been often translated to simply mean \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; it carries a much more intricate interpretation within the framework of Wheel of Heaven. The literal translation from Hebrew gives us \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; – an inherently plural interpretation which contrasts with the monotheistic connotations often associated with the term. This multifaceted interpretation opens a gateway to understanding the rich narrative of the Elohim, a highly advanced civilization believed to have originated from the skies, or more precisely, from outer space.\nThe Elohim, according to Raëlian beliefs, are a group of extraterrestrial scientists who, possessing advanced knowledge and technology, embarked on a cosmic expedition in search of suitable planets to implement their grand designs. Their journey led them to Earth, where they utilized their superior scientific acumen to manipulate genetic material and engineer life, including human beings.\nIn this context, the term \u0026ldquo;Elohim\u0026rdquo; is not a single, omnipotent deity but rather a collective of beings of extraordinary capabilities and intellect. Their history, culture, and technological advancements are fascinating, to say the least, and offer a unique perspective on the genesis of life on Earth. As we delve into their narrative, the terms \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; will frequently emerge. These terms have been adopted to describe anything related to or associated with the Elohim civilization.\nThis article is part of a series aimed at establishing, defining, and standardizing these terms and others in relation to the Elohim narrative. Our goal is to create a consistent, easily understood lexicon for all readers interested in understanding the rich narrative surrounding the Elohim and their pivotal role in the Raëlian narrative.\nWhich descriptor is appropriate? # As we continue our exploration of the Raëlian perspective, two terms will frequently surface: \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Elohimian.\u0026rdquo; Both these words are derivatives of the term \u0026ldquo;Elohim,\u0026rdquo; coined to denote aspects related to this civilization. However, the choice between them is not merely aesthetic. The distinction carries subtle implications that can influence our understanding and interpretation of the Elohim narrative.\nThe suffix \u0026ldquo;-ite\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; aligns with words like \u0026ldquo;Israelite\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Luddite,\u0026rdquo; traditionally used to indicate a group membership or belonging. Using this term might suggest a direct affiliation or connection with the Elohim, pointing to the idea of being part of the same group or sharing similar characteristics. This term would be most appropriately applied when discussing subjects closely linked with the Elohim, such as individuals, belief systems, or practices that stem directly from the Elohim themselves.\nOn the other hand, \u0026ldquo;Elohimian,\u0026rdquo; with its \u0026ldquo;-ian\u0026rdquo; suffix, aligns with terms like \u0026ldquo;Martian\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Victorian,\u0026rdquo; typically used to signify a relationship or connection to a specific place, era, or individual. This term might be more apt when referring to characteristics or attributes associated with the Elohim, rather than direct affiliation. Thus, \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; could be used to describe aspects like culture, technology, or philosophy that are characteristic of the Elohim, but not necessarily originating from a direct connection.\nDeciding between \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; thus becomes a matter of identifying the type of connection we wish to establish with the Elohim. Do we want to emphasize affiliation, as in being part of a group or sharing a common origin, which \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; suggests? Or do we wish to highlight relatedness, a broader connection to the characteristics or attributes of the Elohim, which \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; implies?\nThis choice has the potential to shape our understanding of the Elohim narrative, hence, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to discuss and determine the most appropriate use of these terms in the context of Raëlism.\nThe Lexicon # The Wheel of Heaven Lexicon is a specific collection of terminology, definitions, and phrases used within the Wheel of Heaven website and its associated content. It forms the foundation for understanding and discussing the complex ideas, narratives, and concepts presented in Raëlism.\nThe lexicon is intended to standardize the terms related to Raëlism and adjacent topics, making it easier for readers to grasp these complex concepts, by providing them with a consistent and accurate language framework. The lexicon is the reference point for understanding terms like \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Elohimian,\u0026rdquo; and many others, in the context of the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration of Raëlism and its adjacent premises.\nBy establishing and adhering to this lexicon, the Wheel of Heaven ensures that all contributors use the same language, helping to avoid confusion and misinterpretation. It also helps readers and followers to better understand and engage with the content, promoting clearer communication and discussion on the platform.\nIn this case, these two terms are designed to provide a clear and consistent language framework within the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration of Raëlism, allowing for nuanced discussions about the different aspects of the Elohim and their influence:\nElohimite: This term suggests a direct affiliation with the Elohim, such as being part of the same group, or sharing a common origin or characteristics. Using \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; highlights a close connection, implying a shared lineage or philosophy with the Elohim. This descriptor would be most appropriate when discussing aspects directly linked with the Elohim, such as individuals who adhere to Elohimite teachings, belief systems derived directly from the Elohim, or practices that stem from their knowledge and guidance. In the Wheel of Heaven lexicon, \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; would denote something or someone as a direct extension or part of the Elohim civilization itself.\nElohimian: This term indicates a broader connection to the Elohim, more about relatedness to their characteristics or attributes rather than direct affiliation. Using \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; allows for discussions about aspects of culture, technology, or philosophy that are characteristic of, but not necessarily directly derived from, the Elohim. This descriptor would be most appropriate when discussing elements that align with the qualities or attributes of the Elohim, but aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a direct result of their actions or teachings. In the Wheel of Heaven lexicon, \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; would be used to denote something as being influenced by, resembling, or sharing characteristics with the Elohim civilization.\nWhat now? # As we delve into the rich and complex narrative of Wheel of Heaven, Raëlism and the Elohim, it\u0026rsquo;s vital that we establish a clear and consistent terminology. The terms \u0026ldquo;Elohimite\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Elohimian\u0026rdquo; represent just the beginning of this journey into understanding the language of this fascinating interstellar narrative. These terms, among others, will help us paint a picture of a civilization that is an integral part of the Raëlian canon.

For the most part, it has been either extending and filling the Wiki or writing down the Introduction. Spending time on writing the Wiki really helps putting down all the ideas and circumstantial data that is always filling my head and keeps me up at night, whereas writing the Introduction is my actual priority, but the writing process there is much slower as I kept re-iterating the fundamental structure it should follow.\nAs of now, I settled for four high-level sections:\nAt a glance: That\u0026rsquo;s where I want to put all the information needed for one to decide beforehand what the whole web site is all about wihtout.

Timeline: This is the meat of the Introduction section. It presents a timeline based on the precessional World Ages where the first 6 World Ages represent the Biblical Days of Creation. The remaining 6 World Ages are supposed to explain the chronicles up to the present day culminating in the Age of Aquarius, the Golden Age of Heavenly Revelations.

Aside from creating content, I have also been working on optimizing our website for search engines and improving our overall user experience. This has involved updating our meta descriptions and titles, improving our site speed, and adding new features like a search bar and related articles section. A lot of customization of the underlying basis has taken place. The web site is leveraging Hugo as a static site generator solution that builds all the static site resources at build time and are delivered onto a CDN (Github Pages) that hosts the web site on the edge. This makes downtime less of a problem, and improves user experience by having more geo-aware load times.\nLooking ahead, I am excited to continue creating new and engaging content for our audience and exploring new ways to grow our community. I am also looking forward to seeing how our website evolves over time as I still have tons of ideas what could be potentially incorporated into the web site in a near future when the basic content has been laid out and written out.\nOverall, the past six months have been a learning experience and a time of growth for both myself and the Wheel of Heaven website.

Superifically, it looks a lot like some sort of provocation, that is tweeting a picture featuring what appears to be combining two seemingly opposing symbols. Two symbols that carry heavy historical connotations. \u0026ldquo;Love everyone. #lovespeech\u0026rdquo; wrote Ye alongside his provoking tweet. What one may not know however (and what Ye himself may have not known either) is that this intertwined synthetization of two ostensibly unrelated, opposing symbols was not a new creation by Ye or someone affiliated. This symbol has already been in use for some time. The merging of the Shield of David and the Swastika represents infinity in the Raëlian theology. Indeed a symbol that colloquially equated with love among Raëlians. While Raëlian claim that symbol as their religious emblem, they are also very clear about its origin, namely that they haven\u0026rsquo;t invented it either, but it is deeply entrenched in our historical past and has been used by multiple important civilizations a long time ago.\nYe\u0026rsquo;s Tweet # Yesterday, on the 2nd of December 2022, Ye posted the following Tweet on Twitter:\nThis is interesting as it may be the first time that a well-known celebrity showcases the Raëlian symbol so obviously so that one may ask what this may actually represent.\nFact # Yes, the screenshot portraying a computer screen showing an open Adobe Photoshop window which itself displays a weird looking symbol in black on white background. That symbol clearly has the shape of the infamous Star of David, also called Magen David (shield of David) featuring an interconnected Swastika in its center. Without going as far as to interpret what Ye, formlery Kanye West was trying to express, what he was showing is nothing else, but the emblematic symbol of the Raëlian religion. A new religious movement that got started in 1973 by a Frenchman. This religion and its premises is at the very underlying narrative that this very web site you\u0026rsquo;reading, Wheel of Heaven, tries to uncover.\nExplanation # In the Raëlian theology, more specifically Raëlian cosmology, what we commonly refer as to the universe is considered infinite in size and in scale: infinite space without any relevant borders. Space doesn\u0026rsquo;t end where we think it does, it keeps on being bigger and larger than any we can image. Infinity of space so to speak. Not only that, but space consitsts multiple levels of scale. If the entirey of our known universe is part of an even bigger being, then that scale of existence is higher up so to speak. If that is true for the highest scale, it would be conducive to consider the very same analogy to work for the smallest scales. And indeed, for Raëlians, we are these larger beings for much smaller worlds living in a scale even smaller than sub-atomic particles. As above so below goes the Hermetic saying which takes a new dimension within Raëlian theology. This relationship between smaller and larger scales of existence is the very meaning of the Star of David.\nThe interlaced Swastika within the Raëlian symbol of Infinity represents cyclical nature of an infinite timeline. Combined together, Magen David representing the infinity of space, \u0026ldquo;as above, so below\u0026rdquo; and the Swastika representing the infinity of time are utlimately symbolizing the infity of time and space.\nDive deeper # If you want to learn more about what the Raëlian symbol of infinity means and what the Raëlian religion teaches, then you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place as we at Wheel of Heaven research the very premises of Raëlism as the only existing embodiment of a system of thought that asserts that the Creation myth of Genesis AND the non-existence of an immaterial god as equally true.

We are thrilled to embark on this thought-provoking journey with you, one that may be life-altering or at the very least, provide a newfound appreciation for expanding your mind. Get ready for an adventure that takes us from the foundations of civilization, through the beginning of history and up to present day, focusing on the most crucial events that have shaped our world. As with all grand narratives, let us broaden our perspective and establish some assumptions and considerations upon which our hypothesis is based. Buckle up, you\u0026rsquo;re in for a ride!\nIll. 1 - Ancient monuments in sunset light Opening considerations # The purpose of this write-up is to provide a foundation for our thoughts and establish a framework for exploring the premises that follow. These considerations serve as the building blocks for a comprehensive understanding of the narrative.\nWhen building a case for a narrative like the one we\u0026rsquo;re about to explore, it is essential to begin with a careful examination of the underlying premises that form the foundation of the story. This analytical approach enables a deeper understanding of the fundamental assumptions and ideas that shape the narrative. Once these premises are clearly grasped, their implications can be explored, as well as the broader themes and concepts that emerge from them.\nIn other words, the process involves breaking down the narrative into its core components, critically assessing their validity and coherence, and then using this understanding to develop a well-structured analysis or interpretation that encompasses the narrative\u0026rsquo;s wider context and significance. This method not only helps to clarify one\u0026rsquo;s perspective on the story but also allows for a more compelling and transparent presentation of the case to new comers. The full picture will only start to emerge once you have taken in all aspects of the narrative. The underlying common denominator of everything written down on Wheel on Heaven is the assumption of the narrative.\nThe journey we embark on is not unlike the historical journey of discovering a more favorable route for trade. Just as that journey led to the rediscovery of a new world that changed the status quo, our exploration of ideas may lead to similar breakthroughs. And let us recall that the world was already known to be spherical at that moment in time (yes, ellipsoidal is more accurate), and yet they collectively failed to consider the possbility of the existence of another unknown new world possibly as massive and populous as their own known old world.\nThis analogy serves as a reminder to approach our established beliefs with humility and not take them too seriously. The challenge to consider worlds beyond the preconceptions of our imagination has been a constant in known history. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the proper characterization of what encompasses us all - the speculative realm of outer space. This may come off as a surprise to some, but the context everything eventually is embedded in is indeed outer space. To avoid losing our footing and maintain a rational approach to the impossible, we must maintain some level of humility in our evaluation of the narrative ahead.\nNothing seems impossible anymore # As we navigate the vast, uncharted waters of astronomical research and interplanetary exploration—still nascent fields by human standards—we must remember the landscape of our past is strewn with errors and ill-conceived assumptions. This is not to belittle our strides in knowledge and technology, but a humble reminder to tread carefully, to recognize our fallibility, and to guard against the pitfall of overconfidence.\nIn the grand scheme of scientific discovery, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to separate the realms of scientific fact from the domain of science fiction, the \u0026ldquo;science fictive\u0026rdquo;.1 Rather than taking societal conventions as gospel, we must learn to expand our horizons, to question, to challenge. By doing so, we not only sidestep the blunders of the past but also broaden our comprehension of life\u0026rsquo;s mysteries. By doing so, we can hope to avoid making the same mistakes of the past and continue advancing in our understanding of what makes up life. Human progress as understood in being but one inhabited planet known throughout the vastness of space is what we identify as one of the most pertinent question of the human condition. This frame of reference transcends most if not all aspects of the human experience.\nA quintessential question of the human condition is the existence of life beyond Earth. This query, this deep yearning for companionship in the cosmos, is a thread that weaves through the very fabric of our human experience. It implores us to look beyond our immediate surroundings, to contextualize our existence within the grand cosmic tapestry.\nOur odyssey into the cosmos, steered by the fields of modern astronomy, space science, and astrophysics, continues to reshape our perception of what it means to be human. While much of astrophysical insight rests on the bedrock of computational guesswork and a multitude of assumptions, the staggering scale of the cosmos remains an indisputable fact.2\nEstimates suggest our observable universe is a cosmic ensemble of 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies, each a magnificent orchestration of a few million to trillions of stars. The sheer number of these luminous celestial bodies hints at an unimaginable abundance of potential homes for life.3\nIn this cosmic backdrop, the implications of the space age take on an even more profound significance. The dawn of this era heralded an evolutionary leap for our species, an epochal shift from terrestrial dwellers to cosmic explorers. Fueled by relentless scientific progress and technological innovation, we\u0026rsquo;ve started to overcome the formidable barriers of space travel, despite it still being in its embryonic stage.\nThis is the setting that the subsequent considerations are going to build upon. What\u0026rsquo;s more is the dawn of the space age marked a pivotal moment in human history, as our species ventured beyond Earth\u0026rsquo;s confines and set out to explore the vastness of the cosmos. This monumental journey began with a series of scientific advancements and technological innovations that enabled us to conquer the challenges of space travel, despite its infancy. Nothing seems impossible anymore. Everything seems so that only a little ingenuity and resolution is needed to reach for the stars.\nIn this awe-inspiring vista of cosmic exploration, nothing seems beyond our reach. We stand poised on the precipice of a new age, one that holds the promise of the stars. Yet, as we extend our reach into the cosmos, we must also extend our understanding, armed with humility and curiosity, ready to question, ready to learn, and ready to marvel at the wonders the universe holds in store for us.\nCosmic Serendipity: The Enigma of Life Beyond Earth # The prospect of life beyond the confines of our celestial home has captivated our collective curiosity for centuries. It is an enigma that has not only stoked the fires of our scientific endeavor but has also sparked our wildest imaginings. In the absence of definitive proof of extraterrestrial life, we find ourselves embarking on a journey of speculation, attempting to unravel the intricate matrix of conditions that could make life possible beyond Earth.\nIn our pursuit, we recognize water as a sine qua non of life4. Known as the universal solvent, water serves as the medium in which the symphony of biological processes unfolds. Thus, the detection of this precious liquid in its most habitable form, liquid, on any celestial body, significantly amplifies the odds of discovering life there.\nBeyond the indispensable requirement of water, life demands an environment that walks a delicate balance between dynamism and stability. It requires a safe haven that can shield it from the harsh cosmic realities, yet provide a stage robust enough for the grand play of evolution. This necessitates a stable climate, a protective atmosphere, and a reliable energy source such as a star, capable of sustaining life\u0026rsquo;s incessant dance.\nWe must also consider the role of organic compounds, life\u0026rsquo;s building blocks. These intricate molecules, given the right environment, could be synthesized on a planet itself or delivered by celestial stowaways such as comets or meteorites. Once these building blocks are assembled, the stage is set for the grand spectacle of life to begin.\nOur cosmic companion, the star around which a planet orbits, also plays a vital role in determining the prospects for life. The star needs to have a Goldilocks quality – not too hot, not too cold, not too volatile, but just right – providing consistent heat and energy essential for life to flourish.\nLastly, life as complex and intelligent as us might owe its existence to a series of serendipitous cosmic events. Perhaps it requires the fortuitous formation of a large moon to stabilize the planet\u0026rsquo;s axial tilt, maintaining a climate congenial for life. Maybe the presence of a guardian gas giant, with its gravitational might, shielding the planet from destructive impacts is a necessity. Or, it could be that a planet requires a long and eventful geological history to orchestrate the grand evolutionary ballet that gives rise to intelligent life.\nThis, then, is the delicate balance, the confluence of precise factors, that makes our existence possible. It\u0026rsquo;s a cosmic serendipity that seems nothing short of miraculous. Is it possible that such miraculous serendipity has repeated itself in the vast cosmic ocean, giving birth to other islands of life? We stand at the threshold of this grand mystery, our eyes turned skyward, waiting for the whispers from the cosmos that we are, indeed, not alone.\nThe Enigma of Infinite Space # The vast expanse of the cosmos, the pulsating stars that pierce the veil of the night sky, the silent majesty of countless galaxies and nebulae; they all paint an awe-inspiring, if not humbling, portrait of our universe. In the face of such immeasurable grandeur, it becomes difficult, almost irreverent, to believe that we are the sole sentient inhabitants of this cosmic symphony.\nWithin our current technological capability, there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each brimming with billions, if not trillions, of stars. When we factor in the recently discovered multitude of exoplanets, many of which reside in the habitable zones of their stars, the possibilities of finding life-supporting conditions appear staggering. To assume that Earth is the only theatre of life in such an infinite cosmic stage seems almost audacious, given the vast scales at play.\nThe Drake equation, formulated by astrophysicist Frank Drake, offers an enticing glimpse into the probabilistic nature of extraterrestrial life. Though it\u0026rsquo;s not an equation in the traditional sense, the Drake equation is more of a framework, a tool for pondering over the multitude of variables that could lead to the existence of intelligent, communicative life forms in our galaxy. It provides a tantalizing possibility that there might be thousands, if not millions, of civilizations out there, broadcasting their existence to the cosmos.\nThe importance of the Drake Equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation. It was written not for purposes of quantification at all, but rather as the agenda for the world\u0026rsquo;s first SETI meeting, in Green Bank WV in 1961. It was quite useful for its intended application, which was to summarize all the various factors which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other life.\nDr. Frank Drake (from Ask Dr. SETI | Chapter 3: Philosophy)\nIn the same chapter, Dr. Franke Drake goes on to say the following sentence:\nFor the record, I consider the Drake Equation to be a marvelous tool for quantifying our ignorance.\nYet, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember Dr. Drake\u0026rsquo;s own interpretation of his formula: \u0026ldquo;The importance of the Drake Equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not a crystal ball revealing the exact number of extraterrestrial civilizations but a mirror that reflects our profound ignorance about the universe.\nThis sentiment finds echo in the concept of the \u0026ldquo;cosmic haystack.\u0026rdquo; The term, metaphorically alluding to the classic needle in a haystack conundrum, is used to highlight the daunting challenge that space\u0026rsquo;s vastness poses in our quest for extraterrestrial intelligence. The idea is simple: space is so incredibly vast that even if intelligent civilizations abound, finding them or their signals is akin to finding a single specific straw in an enormous stack of hay.\nConsider this; light from the closest star to our sun, Proxima Centauri, takes more than four years to reach us5. That\u0026rsquo;s the nearest star! When we scale up to galaxies, clusters, and superclusters, the distances become so mind-bogglingly large that the idea of stumbling upon an extraterrestrial signal starts to seem less like a science endeavor and more like winning a cosmic lottery.\nNevertheless, our ignorance should not breed despair but rather kindle curiosity. The universe, in all its infinite glory, beckons us to explore, to seek, to question. The vastness of space, rather than discouraging us, should serve as a humbling reminder of our place in the cosmos and an inspiration to explore its endless mysteries. As long as the stars shimmer in the night sky, the hypothesis of extraterrestrial intelligence will continue to captivate our collective imagination, prompting us to delve deeper into the cosmic abyss in our quest for cosmic companionship.\nUnraveling the Tapestry of Ancient Memories # Humanity\u0026rsquo;s shared history is a richly woven tapestry of myth, mystery, and memory that stretches back to the dawn of consciousness itself. It is a grand tale of our struggle to understand the enigmatic cosmos that unfolds above us, a narrative that has birthed a dazzling array of spiritual traditions, each with its unique metaphoric cosmology. Yet, amidst their diversity, there is a shared thread that binds them together - tales of divine entities, superior beings often revered as gods.\nBut what if these divine figures, these \u0026lsquo;gods,\u0026rsquo; were not merely abstract symbols or metaphysical constructs? What if they were corporeal entities, not of this Earth, whose advanced knowledge and technology left an indelible mark on our ancestors? This seemingly radical idea, when examined more closely, starts to weave an intriguing pattern.\nThe epic narratives of our collective past are replete with stories of incredible flying chariots, weapons capable of cataclysmic destruction, and god-like beings bestowing knowledge that seems strangely advanced for their epochs. Are these simply the imaginative creations of our ancestors, steeped in the language of metaphor and hyperbole? Or could they be cryptic chronicles of real events, veiled accounts of advanced extraterrestrial technology?\nTake, for example, the Vimanas described in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata - flying machines capable of astonishing feats, spewing fire and thunder. Similarly, the Bible\u0026rsquo;s Book of Ezekiel recounts the prophet\u0026rsquo;s vision of a celestial chariot composed of wheels within wheels, descending from the heavens, a spectacle that resonates eerily with modern UFO reports.\nMoreover, these narratives aren\u0026rsquo;t confined to one culture or epoch. From the ancient Sumerians, who believed their gods, the Anunnaki, hailed from the heavens, to the Dogon people of Mali, whose traditional cosmology includes knowledge of the Sirius star system\u0026rsquo;s complexities that baffled modern astronomers, we find recurring themes of celestial beings and their wondrous technologies.\nThis begs the question - are these stories mere myth or memory? Are we unconsciously carrying the echoes of our extraterrestrial ancestors in the sacred stories we pass down through generations?\nCritics might dismiss this as an exercise in fanciful thinking, an attempt to romanticize our past with the sheen of science fiction. Yet, one can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if we\u0026rsquo;re dismissing too quickly, driven by modern arrogance. As Arthur C. Clarke\u0026rsquo;s third law states, \u0026ldquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps, what our ancestors perceived as divine was simply technology far beyond their understanding.\nWhat if we are not trying to impose a science fiction narrative onto our past, but rather, are attempting to decode a science factual past that\u0026rsquo;s been woven into our myths and legends, a past where our ancestors were not merely spectators of celestial miracles, but active participants in a grand cosmic drama, a drama that shaped the course of our species\u0026rsquo; evolution?\nWhat do the scriptures say? # Before exploring the reinterpretation possibilities proposed by Jean Sendy and Mauro Biglino, let us delve deeper into the fundamental material of our discussion: the scriptures. These texts, dated thousands of years back, carry profound religious and cultural significance and have shaped our moral, ethical, and spiritual understanding of the world around us. The question we pose today is not about their historical relevance or the inherent wisdom they hold, but rather about their potential misinterpretation over the centuries. Is it plausible that the truths they convey have been misconstrued, or even lost, due to interpretive variances?\nThe scriptures, encompassing a multitude of ancient texts like the Bible, Torah, and others, are a goldmine of stories, teachings, and descriptions of divine interactions with humanity. These texts have been studied and examined extensively by scholars, theologians, and philosophers who have derived a plethora of interpretations and understanding of these narratives. Yet, the exegesis and interpretations have often been shaped by the prevalent socio-cultural context, theological doctrines, and individual perspectives. This can raise questions about the fidelity of our contemporary understanding to the original intentions of the ancient scribes.\nMoreover, it\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that these texts were written in languages and dialects vastly different from modern ones, leading to potential ambiguities and inaccuracies during translation. Words and idioms in one language might not have exact equivalents in another, which might lead to a shift in the nuances and meaning of the text when translated. In addition to this, the evolution of languages over time and the possible extinction of certain words or phrases could complicate our understanding of these ancient texts.\nBeyond linguistic concerns, the historical and cultural context in which these scriptures were written also play a crucial role in their interpretation. Every culture and society has its unique belief system, values, traditions, and symbols that influence its literature. The authors of these scriptures wrote them within a specific cultural milieu which may be vastly different from ours today. This difference can lead to a gap in our understanding of the cultural references, metaphors, and symbols used in the texts.\nLastly, the scriptures were initially disseminated through oral tradition before being transcribed. This process could have led to alterations and additions, whether intentional or not, which may have caused deviations from the original narratives. Subsequent copying of these texts over centuries, each time by different scribes, could have further compounded these discrepancies.\nTherefore, while our current interpretations provide a valuable understanding of these ancient texts, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to recognize that they may not fully or accurately represent the original intentions of the scriptures. There is a strong argument to be made for a reinterpretation of these texts, one that takes into account the original languages, historical and cultural contexts, and the potential changes brought about by centuries of oral transmission and copying. Both Sendy and Biglino, as we will explore in the subsequent chapters, propose innovative methodologies to do just that. By shedding preconceived notions and adopting a fresh approach, they suggest that we might uncover hidden truths and new insights from these ancient texts.\nSendy\u0026rsquo;s law # In his book \u0026ldquo;The Coming of the Gods,\u0026rdquo; published in 1970, Jean Sendy put forward a compelling argument for the possible existence of ancient astronauts who once visited Earth and greatly influenced the trajectory of human civilization. Sendy interpreted several ancient myths and religious traditions as probable evidence of extraterrestrial contact. He proposed that this contact could have left a lasting impression on human culture and belief systems.\nTo effectively establish his unique interpretation of the Bible, Sendy stipulated five conditions that must be satisfied:\nProficiency in the contents of the Bible: To accurately interpret the text, one must have a thorough understanding of the scriptures. An alternative method to become familiar with the original meanings of Biblical scriptures could be the Biglino method, which calls for a literal interpretation of the Bible rather than depending on figurative language or traditional exegesis.\nAcquaintance with current space science and spaceflight: To comprehend what is feasible and unfeasible within modern physics and astronautics, a solid grounding in the current state of space science is crucial.\nRobust understanding of various scientific domains including biology, prehistory, history, and evolution: This broad-based knowledge helps to accurately interpret the scriptures by considering the historical and evolutionary contexts of the text and the scientific knowledge accrued over the years.\nDismissal of the supernatural: This means interpreting the text without invoking divine intervention or any other supernatural phenomenon, thereby aligning with contemporary scientific knowledge.\nAcceptance of a universe that is intelligible to human reason: This signifies that Sendy believed the scriptures could be unraveled using human reasoning and scientific methodologies.\nThese five conditions collectively support Sendy\u0026rsquo;s belief that the theory of ancient astronauts in the Bible can be defended through a meticulous scientific examination of the text.\nSendy\u0026rsquo;s rejection of supernatural elements and his belief in the rational intelligibility of the universe echo the principles of philosophical naturalism and scientific realism. Naturalism negates supernatural explanations, asserting that the natural world and its inhabitants, including humans, can be explained through natural causes and laws, and that the world is knowable via scientific inquiry and human reason.\nScientific realism posits that scientific theories offer accurate descriptions of the world, with the entities and processes theorized in science being real and existing independently of our observation. It firmly believes in the orderliness and intelligibility of the natural world and trusts that scientific inquiries can offer a reliable understanding of it.\nRaëlism, a contemporary religious movement, exhibits similarities to Sendy\u0026rsquo;s perspective, particularly in its beliefs about extraterrestrial life and its attempts to reconcile science and religion. Both Raëlism and Sendy suggest the feasibility of extraterrestrial life and postulate that alien beings have previously visited Earth. They also harbor a shared interest in the idea that ancient texts, like the Bible, may hold references to extraterrestrial life or suggest alien interventions in human history. Raëlians, similar to Sendy, reject traditional religious interpretations of the Bible and seek to discover the scientific truths they believe are encoded within the text.\nReading the Bible like Schliemann read Homer # The story of Heinrich Schliemann, a businessman turned archaeologist, provides an interesting parallel to Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s approach to biblical interpretation. Schliemann, credited with uncovering the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae, took a unique approach to ancient mythology. Instead of viewing the tales of the Iliad and the Odyssey as pure fiction, he believed they held a kernel of historical truth and set out to discover it.\nThis literal interpretation of ancient texts was innovative at the time, and it is reminiscent of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s own method of reading the Bible, as expressed in his book Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth. He posited that applying the same level of literal analysis to the Bible could yield equally significant insights, paralleling Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s exploration of the Iliad.\nSendy argues that this approach allows readers to examine the Bible as an historical document, detailing interactions with an advanced interstellar civilization, instead of viewing it purely as a spiritual guide. He advises readers to approach the Bible as Schliemann approached Homer, by \u0026lsquo;ignoring all the exegeses that have accumulated around it for the past two thousand years\u0026rsquo;. This approach involves setting aside existing theological interpretations and reading the Bible in its most literal and concrete sense.\nThe comparison to Schliemann extends beyond the approach to reading ancient texts, it also touches upon the reactions that such groundbreaking assertions can engender. Much like Schliemann faced skepticism and denial when he suggested that the Homeric tales held a basis in historical fact, so too do proponents of the ancient astronaut theory face similar reactions. These theories often spark disbelief and even ridicule, as they challenge long-held beliefs and understandings of biblical narratives.\nThis shift in interpretation echoes the impact of other revolutionary figures such as Galileo, who turned the prevailing geocentric view of the universe on its head by asserting a heliocentric model. Much like Galileo’s paradigm-shifting discovery, the work of figures like Sendy and Biglino faces initial resistance, often followed by grudging acceptance and, in some cases, complete transformation of the prevailing paradigm.\nSendy\u0026rsquo;s and Biglino’s approach to interpreting biblical narratives, much like Schliemann’s approach to Homer\u0026rsquo;s epics, presents a departure from established interpretations, seeking instead to explore these texts from a literal and historical perspective. This approach, while controversial, offers a new lens through which to view and understand these ancient works, potentially uncovering fresh insights about our past and our understanding of the universe. This openness to new interpretations reflects a willingness to challenge the status quo and to push the boundaries of our knowledge, much like Schliemann did in his time. By highlighting this parallel, Sendy not only offers a new perspective on the Bible but also aligns himself with a tradition of thought that challenges established norms and continually seeks to explore the unknown.\nBiglino\u0026rsquo;s method # Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method, as outlined in The Naked Bible and further expanded upon through his work, encourages readers to embark on an intellectual journey akin to what Schliemann embarked upon in the world of archaeology. Schliemann, armed with Homer\u0026rsquo;s texts, set out to unearth a world long dismissed as purely mythical, while Biglino, equipped with the Hebrew Bible, endeavors to bring to light a narrative buried under millennia of theological interpretations.\nThe analogy of Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s methods, as Jean Sendy pointed out, is not a mere rhetorical flourish but a call to shift the paradigm in understanding ancient texts. In the same vein, Biglino\u0026#39;s method is an attempt to rewrite the accepted interpretation of the Bible, mirroring Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s audacity to challenge the status quo of his time.\nIn Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method, a key factor is the appeal to a literal interpretation, unclouded by metaphoric readings. This approach mirrors Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s literal understanding of the Homeric texts that led him to the actual geographical locations of Troy and Mycenae. Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s literal interpretation revealed an entirely different perspective of the texts, much like Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method seeks to reveal a fresh interpretation of the biblical narrative.\nThe first step in Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method is familiarization with the original text. Just as Schliemann immersed himself in the world of Homer\u0026rsquo;s Iliad, so too does Biglino advocate for a deep familiarity with the Hebrew Bible. The second step, setting aside preconceived traditional interpretations, parallels Schliemann disregarding the prevailing belief that the Homeric cities were mythical. Lastly, the commitment to a literal reading, in both Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s approach and Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method, grounds their investigations in the tangibility of the texts.\nBiglino also acknowledges the inherent uncertainty that comes with ancient texts. Like Schliemann who worked with ancient ruins and Homeric texts that had been translated and interpreted numerous times, Biglino is aware that he is working with biblical copies of copies. Yet, both of them don\u0026rsquo;t let this uncertainty hinder their pursuits. Instead, they use it as a starting point to \u0026lsquo;pretend\u0026rsquo; that the stories are true, leading to astounding revelations and new perspectives on the old narratives.\nAssumptions # As we navigate our way towards the end of this exploration, it becomes crucial to understand the bedrock of assumptions that underpin the entirety of our journey. These assumptions form the basis for our interpretation and understanding of the ancient texts and scriptures.\nLife on Earth is meaningful: It is assumed that our existence on Earth is not an accidental or random occurrence. There is a purpose and meaning behind life on this planet. This assumption doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily imply a divine intervention or a specific teleological perspective. Rather, it is a position that recognises the complexity and intricacy of life and seeks to explore the profound implications and possibilities associated with our existence.\nVastness of space is significant: The expansive and seemingly infinite nature of space isn\u0026rsquo;t seen as empty or meaningless. Its vastness holds significance and raises fundamental questions about our place within it. Are we alone, or is there other life out there? What role might extraterrestrial beings have played in our past, and what potential role might they play in our future?\nScriptures and religion are deliberate: The holy scriptures, myths, and religions of various cultures are not just a series of fables or moral tales but deliberate efforts to explain and record phenomena experienced by ancient peoples. This includes unusual events and encounters that may have seemed divine or supernatural to them but might have been interactions with technologically advanced beings or civilizations.\nGods must have been real: This assumption builds upon the concept of Neo-euhemerism, a term derived from the Greek philosopher Euḗmeros. It involves the speculative idea that the gods and people from ancient mythologies were not mythical beings, but rather real, humanoid entities. In a more daring interpretation, this perspective suggests that these entities could be extraterrestrial humanoids. This concept not only reframes our understanding of religious and mythological narratives but also forces us to re-evaluate our perception of our history, our universe, and ultimately ourselves.\nEach of these assumptions encourages us to question conventional wisdom and broaden our perspective. They serve as the pillars supporting an audacious yet compelling exploration of our past, grounded in an appreciation for the vast potential of the universe and the complex mystery that is life itself. By embracing these assumptions, we equip ourselves with a lens that enables us to revisit our ancient texts with newfound curiosity and an open mind, poised to unlock insights that might redefine our understanding of our own origins and destiny.\n\u0026ldquo;Science fictive\u0026rdquo;, an idiom commonly used by Jean Sendy in his many publications. Fictional science refers to the notion that many concepts of science-fiction has been incorporated in the popular thought of science and vice-versa. In this context, it should be understood that many grand narratives that are commonly understood to be flagship insights of contemporary scientific inquiry such as anthropologial climate change, the physical theory of Big Bang or Evolution-induced abiogenesis are down-the-line best characterized as fictional in the same vein as Flat Earth has historically devolved from a popular belief endorsed by an authoritative quasi-scientific institution into oblivion.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nNo matter how sophisticated and well calculated the approximation of a given astronomical distance is, we have yet to traverse that distance to ultimately confirm the distance itself.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIt is impossible to provide an exact number of stars in the entire universe, as our knowledge is limited to the observable universe, which is a fraction of the total cosmos. The observable universe has an estimated 93 billion light-years in diameter, while the total universe might be much larger or even infinite. A rough estimate suggests there could be around 200 sextillion (2 x 10^23) stars in the observable universe. However, it is important to note that these numbers are only approximations and are based on our current understanding of the cosmos, which is continually evolving as we gather more information through advancements in astronomical observation and research.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe phrase sine qua non is Latin for “without which not.” When something is described as sine qua non, it is a necessary or indispensable requirement.

It presents a cosmic pluralism viewpoint, suggesting that the vast universe likely harbors abundant sentient life, possibly in proximity to Earth. This section underpins the narrative that sentient life on Earth is part of a broader interstellar chain of civilizations, providing a cohesive foundation for the website's grand narrative and exploration of humanity's cosmic connections​​.","content":"Considering the hypothesis outlined in the previous chapter, it becomes evident that a framework of thought emerges that enables us to create a consistent portrayal of the possible origins of life on Earth. The aesthetics provided by this portrayal form the foundation of the grand narrative we put forward. This narrative depicts how sentient life on planet Earth is best explained as being another link in an interstellar chain of planetary civilizations. This idea can be seen as a revival of the concept of cosmic pluralism, which posits that the vastness of space makes it highly likely that sentient life is abundant and that this abundance makes it plausible for sentient life to exist in close proximity to Earth for a long time.\nWith continuous advancements in space travel and genetic engineering, it is becoming increasingly apparent that these technologies will soon empower us to become a space-faring civilization with the capability to spread life across other worlds. As we progress through the 21st century, these ideas have transcended the realm of fantasy or science fiction and are becoming increasingly plausible and grounded in reality.\nWe recognize that some critics may accuse us of cherry-picking facts or misconstruing speculative conclusions. However, we endeavor to maintain honesty and transparency in our presentation of the narrative\u0026rsquo;s foundations. We hold that the emerging picture will be self-evident once it is fully realized.\nIll. 1 - Monolithic structure covered in snow The four pillars # To that effect, let us consider 4 aspects by which we\u0026rsquo;re going to establish the cornerstone of the grand narrative. These four aspects can be summarized as follows:\nCosmic pluralism: This idea proposes that the immense expanse of space contains a plethora of worlds, each teeming with intelligent life. The vastness of the cosmos and the innumerable celestial bodies it encompasses suggest that the probability of encountering other civilizations is much higher than previously assumed. The Tradition: Building upon the first aspect, the awareness of Earth\u0026rsquo;s status as just one of many inhabited worlds has persisted throughout history. This awareness, coupled with ancestral wisdom encompassing a broad spectrum of scientific, technological, and historical knowledge, has been safeguarded through an all-encompassing Tradition. This Tradition serves as a bridge between the past and the present, reminding us of our cosmic connections and obligations. The Truth: The Truth encompasses the idea that our origins\u0026rsquo; reality has not only been preserved by the earthly efforts known as the Tradition, but also by the continued presence and interaction of the Gods of Old, the Heavenly Fathers, the Spacefarers, and the Ones who came from the Skies. These celestial beings have not merely disappeared into the annals of history; instead, they have proactively engaged with and guided our progress since our synthetic inception during the creation project outlined in the Biblical Genesis. The Cycle: The Cycle posits that intelligent life ensures its preservation throughout interstellar space by disseminating life across new planetary frontiers. This interstellar procreation is, in a sense, encoded within us, and the cycle perpetuates in accordance with the secular movement of Precession. As we enter the Age of Aquarius, we bear witness to the reawakening of knowledge that had been lost or obscured in previous eras. By further exploring these four pillars, we hope to provide a comprehensive and convincing argument for the grand narrative we propose, allowing readers to contemplate the true extent of our cosmic heritage and the potential future of humanity as a space-faring civilization.\nCosmic pluralism # Cosmic pluralism is the first foundational aspect of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis, centered around the idea that the vastness of space is home to a multitude of worlds, each harboring intelligent life. This concept suggests that our planet is but one of countless others that host advanced civilizations, highlighting the incredible diversity and potential for life throughout the cosmos.\nThis notion of cosmic pluralism challenges the idea that Earth is unique in its capacity to support intelligent life. Instead, it posits that the universe is teeming with a wide variety of life forms and civilizations, each with their own unique histories, technologies, and cultures. By acknowledging the existence of these diverse worlds, we can begin to appreciate the interconnectedness of life on a cosmic scale and recognize the potential for collaboration and learning between different species and civilizations.\nCosmic pluralism also underscores the importance of humanity\u0026rsquo;s continued exploration of the universe, as it implies that our quest for knowledge and understanding is not limited to our home planet. By venturing beyond Earth, we have the opportunity to discover new worlds, encounter other intelligent life forms, and gain insights that can enhance our own civilization.\nThe Tradition # The Tradition represents the enduring awareness that Earth is just one of many inhabited worlds in the cosmos. Throughout history, this recognition of our place in the universe has been preserved and transmitted across generations. The Tradition encompasses not only the understanding of extraterrestrial life but also the ancestral wisdom concerning various scientific, technological, and historical knowledge.\nThis all-encompassing Tradition has served as a means of safeguarding and perpetuating the awareness of our cosmic connections, ensuring that humanity\u0026rsquo;s understanding of its place in the universe is not lost or forgotten. By preserving this knowledge, the Tradition has also allowed for the continued development of our collective consciousness and understanding of the cosmos.\nThe Tradition acknowledges the possibility that ancient civilizations may have had contact with extraterrestrial beings, such as the Elohim, and that these interactions could have influenced our understanding of the universe and ourselves. This awareness has been passed down through generations, manifesting in various forms such as myths, legends, religious texts, and esoteric teachings. These diverse expressions of the Tradition serve to maintain and strengthen the understanding of our cosmic origins and connections.\nFurthermore, the Tradition emphasizes the importance of integrating this ancestral wisdom with the latest scientific, technological, and political developments. By doing so, we can more fully comprehend the implications of our place in the universe and the potential for interstellar exploration and the propagation of life throughout the cosmos. This synthesis of ancient wisdom and modern advancements allows for a more complete and holistic understanding of the human experience, our cosmic origins, and our ultimate destiny.\nThe Truth # The Truth is another foundational aspect of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis, which posits that our understanding of our origins has been preserved not only through the Earthly safeguarding known as the Tradition, but also through the ongoing interactions of the extraterrestrial beings who played a crucial role in our creation.\nThese beings, referred to as the Gods of Old, the Heavenly Fathers, the Spacefarers, or the Ones who came from the Skies, are believed to have maintained a proactive relationship with humanity since our synthetic inception. Rather than simply vanishing after creating life on Earth, these advanced beings have continued to guide and influence our progress throughout history.\nThe Truth emphasizes that the presence of these extraterrestrial beings is not merely a matter of historical curiosity, but an ongoing reality that shapes our understanding of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. Their continued interactions with humanity serve as a reminder of our cosmic origins and highlight the potential for future collaboration as we evolve into an interstellar civilization.\nThis aspect of the hypothesis suggests that these beings have been instrumental in shaping human development across various fields, such as science, technology, politics, and spirituality. By imparting their knowledge and wisdom, they have helped to advance our understanding of the universe and our own capabilities.\nThe Cycle # The Cycle is another foundational aspect of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis, focusing on the idea that intelligent life perpetuates itself across the vast expanse of interstellar space by seeding life on new planetary frontiers. This cosmic process of spreading and renewing life is ingrained within us and forms a crucial component of our destiny as an evolving species.\nAccording to the Cycle, interstellar procreation is an innate characteristic of intelligent life, driving us to explore the universe and expand our presence beyond our home planet. On Earth at least, this process is believed to have occured in accordance with the secular movement of Precession, an astronomical phenomenon that governs the gradual shift of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis over time.\nAs we enter the Age of Aquarius, a new era marked by the Precession, the Cycle suggests that humanity will become increasingly aware of our cosmic origins and the knowledge that has been lost or obscured throughout history. This renewed awareness will guide us towards a deeper understanding of our place in the universe and the significance of the cosmic cycle of life.\nThe Age of Aquarius is considered a transformative period that bears the hallmarks of rediscovering our connection to the extraterrestrial beings who created life on Earth, as well as our inherent drive to explore and populate new worlds. This awakening will enable humanity to embrace its cosmic heritage and actively participate in the ongoing Cycle of interstellar procreation.\n"},{"id":"9","href":"/intro/the-hypothesis/","title":"The Hypothesis","description":"The Hypothesis elaborates on a theory deeply influenced by the Raëlian revelations. It explores the idea that an advanced extraterrestrial civilization known as the Elohim played a crucial role in creating life on Earth. The website proposes a nuanced interpretation of these Raëlian messages, considering them in the context of our evolving world. This hypothesis forms the backbone of the website's narrative and underpins its exploration of humanity's origins and place in the universe​​.","content":"The hypothesis presented here at Wheel of Heaven is profoundly influenced by the Raëlian revelations, as it embraces the core message of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s role in creating life on Earth. By considering the Raëlian messages to be authentic, Wheel of Heaven proposes a more nuanced understanding of the Raëlian messages and their implications within the context of our rapidly evolving world.\nIn the canon of the Raëlian messages, the Elohim are portrayed as an advanced extraterrestrial civilization responsible for creating life on Earth. According to this belief, the creation process occurred within a precessional cycle of less than 26,000 years, a relatively short time frame when compared to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s geological history.\nThe Raëlian messages, which are considered to be congruent and coherent, present the Elohim as beings who mastered the science of genetics and used their knowledge to engineer a diverse array of life forms on Earth, including humans. These messages are said to be encoded within ancient religious texts, particularly the Bible, wherein the Elohim are sometimes misinterpreted as \u0026ldquo;gods.\u0026rdquo;\nAs humanity continues to develop its scientific understanding and technological capabilities, the Raëlian hypothesis suggests that we are approaching a significant turning point in our development, the entering into the Age of Aquarius, a new Golden Age for humanity where the Truth is being revealed again. This involves humans becoming an interstellar civilization capable of traveling across the cosmos and seeding life on other planets. In this way, humanity would be carrying on the legacy of the Elohim and participating in a cosmic cycle of creation and propagation of life.\nThis transformative process mirrors the events described in the Genesis creation story, where life is brought forth on a previously barren planet. Under this scenario, humans would take on the role of the Elohim, using advanced technologies and genetic engineering to create new life forms on distant worlds. This cosmic endeavor would not only represent a significant milestone in humanity\u0026rsquo;s progress but also perpetuate the cycle of life throughout the universe.\nFurthermore, this hypothesis heavily challenges established contemporary paradigms and encourages us to explore the potential implications of our cosmic origins. By accepting the possibility that life on Earth was seeded by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, we open ourselves up to a wealth of new questions and potential avenues of exploration. These inquiries could range from deciphering the true nature of ancient religious texts to examining the possibility of contact with the Elohim or other extraterrestrial beings in the past, present, or future.\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis invites us to confront the limits of our understanding and consider the broader implications of humanity\u0026rsquo;s place within the cosmos. This perspective offers us a glimpse into a future where we are not only the beneficiaries of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s creative legacy but also active participants in the ongoing process of cosmic creation and evolution.\nBy extending the Raëlian hypothesis, Wheel of Heaven seeks to inspire further inquiry, debate, and reflection on the mysteries of our origins and the potential destiny that awaits us as a space-faring civilization. By doing so, we hope to foster a sense of wonder and curiosity about the infinite possibilities that may lie ahead for humanity as we continue our journey through the cosmos.\nIll. 1 - Spacecraft in orbit Where does that leave us # The Wheel of Heaven hypothesis not only broadens our understanding of the Raëlian revelations but also prompts us to reevaluate the nature of our existence and consider the profound implications of our potential extraterrestrial origins. By contemplating the role of the Elohim in the creation of life on Earth, we are encouraged to examine the intersections between science, spirituality, and the search for meaning in an ever-expanding universe.\nOne aspect of this hypothesis that warrants further exploration is the potential impact of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s genetic engineering on human evolution and development. If the Elohim were indeed responsible for the creation of life on Earth, including humanity, what role did their advanced genetic knowledge play in shaping our species\u0026rsquo; traits, abilities, and even our propensity for spiritual and intellectual growth? This line of inquiry could lead to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between nature and nurture, genetics and environment, and the role of extraterrestrial intervention in human development.\nAnother intriguing dimension of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis is the exploration of ancient religious texts and mythologies through the lens of extraterrestrial contact. By considering the possibility that these texts contain encoded messages from advanced civilizations such as the Elohim, we are prompted to reexamine the wisdom and insights contained within them. This reinterpretation could lead to a synthesis of spiritual and scientific perspectives, allowing us to glean new insights into the nature of existence, consciousness, and our place in the cosmos.\nThe Wheel of Heaven hypothesis also opens up a wealth of possibilities for future human endeavors in space exploration and colonization. If we indeed carry the legacy of the Elohim as creators and propagators of life, what ethical responsibilities and challenges might we face as we venture beyond our home planet and encounter other life forms in the universe? How might our understanding of our cosmic origins inform our approach to space travel, diplomacy, and the potential colonization of other worlds?\nAdditionally, the hypothesis invites us to consider the potential for ongoing contact between humanity and extraterrestrial civilizations such as the Elohim. If they have been guiding our development throughout history, what might the future hold for our relationship with these advanced beings? Will we eventually establish open communication, collaboration, or even form alliances with them, or will our interactions remain shrouded in mystery and intrigue?\nIn conclusion, the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis serves as a catalyst for deepening our understanding of the universe, our origins, and our potential destiny as a space-faring civilization. By embracing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in the creation of life on Earth, we open ourselves up to a vast array of questions, challenges, and opportunities that can enrich our collective knowledge and shape our future in profound and unforeseen ways. As we continue to push the boundaries of our understanding, we remain ever-curious about the mysteries that lie ahead and the potential for uncovering the truth of our cosmic heritage.\nThe Timeline # Having established the basis of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis and its profound implications for our understanding of humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins, our relationship with the advanced extraterrestrial civilization of the Elohim, and our potential destiny as a space-faring species, we now turn our attention to an examination of the broader historical context in which these revelations take place. In the upcoming section, \u0026ldquo;Timeline,\u0026rdquo; we will embark on a journey through the vast timeline of 26,000 years, culminating in today\u0026rsquo;s day and age.\nThe timeline begins sometime before around -22,000, right at the doorstep of the Age of Capricorn. What precedes the Age of Capricorn is an Age of Aquarius of the preceding Great Year. Before we delve into the first precessional Great Month, the Capricornian World Age, it is essential to examine the events that led up to this significant period in cosmic history. To illustrate what happened, we\u0026rsquo;re taking inspiration from a classic of the American film industry, Jurassic Park.\nAs we explore this expansive timeline and the cosmic cycles that have shaped our history, we will uncover fascinating insights into the evolution of human civilization, the influence of the Elohim, and the recurring themes that have emerged throughout the Ages. This exploration will not only deepen our understanding of the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis but also provide a rich context for appreciating the unfolding narrative of our cosmic journey.\nAs we transition from the foundational Wheel of Heaven hypothesis to the exploration of the broader historical and cosmic context in the \u0026ldquo;Preamble\u0026rdquo; chapter, we invite you to join us on this fascinating journey through time and space, as we uncover the mysteries of our past, contemplate the significance of our present, and envision the incredible possibilities that await us in the future.\n"},{"id":"10","href":"/intro/preamble/","title":"Preamble","description":"The Preamble introduces a speculative narrative about an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the Elohim, who embark on genetic experimentation and interstellar exploration.

What preceeds the Age of Capricorn is an Age of Aquarius of the preceeding Great Year. Before we get started with the first precessional Great Month, the Capricornian World Age, it is worth examining what led up to it. To illustrate what happened, we can take inspiration from a classic of the American film industry, Jurassic Park.\nHubris or bravery? # Have you watched the classic film series Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg?1 We will be using the movie\u0026rsquo;s premise and fictional setting as a starting point for our journey of space explorers, planet terraformers, and life creators. The first movie introduces us to wealthy and successful entrepreneur John Hammond and his team of brilliant scientists, who use cloning and genetic engineering to bring dinosaurs back to life. According to the movie, prehistoric mosquitos trapped in un-fossilized amber still contain the partially intact blood of some reptiles, which serves as the basis for DNA extraction. To complete the DNA, the gaps are filled with frog DNA through a speculative process. With this, the scientists are able to revive the long-extinct dinosaurs, which are showcased in a theme park on a Central American island, attracting visitors from all over the world.\nHowever, things go wrong when the dinosaurs break free and create chaos, but the main characters manage to survive against all odds and are rescued by an extraction team at the end of the movie, a pattern that continues in the series. The film series is known for its skeptical view of scientific progress and human hubris, inspired by Michael Crichton\u0026rsquo;s 1990 novel of the same name.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the connection: According to the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis, based on the revelations made by Yahweh to Raël, what happened at the onset of the Age of Capricorn could have been taken straight from the pages of Jurassic Park: In this scenario, a group of visionary scientists create a new and potentially dangerous species through genetic engineering, which ultimately leads to a catastrophic outcome and endangers their research.\nIll. 1 - Genetic lab experiment gone wrong Once upon a time # Obviously, Jurassic Parc is fictional and no research institution has been in the news for having synthetized an extinct or even a new species of life lately. The events that we\u0026rsquo;re about to discuss are to be situated in a totally different day and age.\nAs we pointed out in the previous chapter The hypothesis, we acknowledge the narrative put forward in the three founding books of Räelism as canonical2. These books document a series of series of encounters between Yahweh, the head representative of a Heavenly extraterrestrial council of Eternals, that were mistaken for Gods over the ages, and a Frenchman. This council of Eternals is best considered a governing body of an extraterrestrial civilization we commonly remember as the Elohim. The aforementioned Frenchman, who was given the name Ra-el designating his role as an Earthly ambassador, went on to form a new religious movement, Raëlism3. One of the main goals of the newly found movement is to preserve, translate and propagate the messages entrusted by Yahweh to all receptive ears. In these messages, Yahweh demystifies the notion of God, revises the meaning of religion and recounts an in-depth retelling of the Biblical Genesis creation narrative.\nIn one of these retellings, Yahweh gives a significant chronological clue to situate the beginning of their arrival on planet Earth:\nSome 22,000 years ago, your creators decided to start their work on Earth, and everything that has happened since was anticipated because the movement of the galaxy implies this knowledge.\nThis puts us right at in between the years of –21'810 and –19'650, the range of years that make up the Age of Capricorn. The Elohim allegedly came to Earth and started their work thereon. While the precessional wobble of the Earthly axis is not unique to this planet, the duration and the effect it has on the observable night sky is. As much as an Earhtly day or an Earthly year are unique characteristics of our planet, the precessional World Ages as much of a unique characteristic.\nTherefore, the moment of arrival of an extraterrestrial civilization to a planet devoid of life would mark the beginning of having an intelligent entity being capable of observing astral phenomenons as seen from planet Earth. Along the twelve World Ages, the Age of Capricorn starting in –21'810 would make an appropriate starting point of the overall chronology put forward here on Wheel of Heaven.\nMoreover, in ordinary or popular astrology, the astrological sign of Capricorn is thought to last from 22nd of December to 19th of January4. In the Gregorian calender, the New Year\u0026rsquo;s Day falls on the 1st of January. This makes both the precession induced Age of Capricorn as well as the ordinary astrological sign Capricorn symbols of start and end of a longer cycle. What an interesting coincidence that deserves more pondering. To recap, the Age of Capricorn is best considered to be the precessional January, starting in –21'810, where a full precessional year, the Great Year takes full 25'920 years. The Age of Capricorn presently marking the arrival of the Elohim on planet Earth.\nOn a distant planet # The narrative as recorded during the encounters between Raël and Yahweh is for the most part a commentary on the Biblical scriptures. In an exegetical manner5, Yahweh recollects what happened in the beginning, during Genesis6. However, before he starts commenting on the Biblical passages, he establishes a prologue to the events described in Genesis. That prologue brings us back to Jurassic Park.\nThe story of the Elohim evidently doesn\u0026rsquo;t start on planet Earth. They originate from another planet, an Elohimian home planet. Yahweh starts off the story with remembering what preceded the events Genesis and eventually lead to them:\nA very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.\nThe scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe parallels with the Jurassic Park lore is staggering. We note that some 24'000 years ago, on a distant planet, the Elohimian home planet, its inhabitants managed to develop a civilization capable of artifical gene synthesis de novo7. These advancements of genetic engineering lead them to synthetically engineer new life forms. Ulimately, that branch of research of synthetic life engineering ended in a fateful casuality where some of these synthetically created animals broke loose and did kill many people.\nWe must imagine how a civilization similar to ours, even if slightly more advanced and developed, would react to experimental research like that. Especially considering that the concerns voiced by an eminent faction among the populace, deeming that kind of research to be distateful, objectionable and most importantly dangerous proved to be appropriate. In our day and age, abundant with controversies and mistrust towards executive and leading institutions, a research project of the same magnitude, if it were to become a public matter, would most likely provoke a similar amount of criticism and politicization. The very popularity of the Jurassic Park franchise is a telling indicator on how arguments would be made.\nThe franchise explores the dangers of playing God through the use of genetic engineering to bring extinct species back to life. In the first Jurassic Park movie for instance, the character Dr. Ian Malcolm warns of the dangers of genetic engineering and the risks of creating genetically modified organisms that can potentially escape and wreak havoc on the world. He argues that the scientists behind the creation of the park were so preoccupied with whether or not they could create dinosaurs, they never stopped to think if they should.\nThe subsequent films in the franchise also continue to explore the consequences of genetic engineering, such as the development of hybrid dinosaurs with unpredictable and dangerous behaviors. Through these themes, the Jurassic Park franchise critiques the potential for science to be used for destructive purposes and emphasizes the importance of responsible scientific research and development.\nWhat happened after these monsters broke free? The second part of the prologue as recounted by Yahweh finished with the following sentence:\n[\u0026hellip;] Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments.\nThis brings us back to Jurassic Park lore once more. In the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park movies, Jurassic World (2015), the female lead character Claire Dearing mentions the possibility of the space program being as profitable as dinosaur-based theme parks8. Although the movie is fictional, this detail is intriguing. The writers suggests that in a society as advanced as the one depicted in the film, genetic engineering and space travel could potentially develop concurrently.\nApparently, this concurrency did happen for the Elohimian civilization. Considering our own pace of scientific and technological progress of the past few decades, it isn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a stretch to imagine that a sophisticated state of genetic engineering capabilities, where life synthetization is possible, coincides with interplanetary and interstellar space travel capabilities in terms of civilizational progress9. It is also reasonable to assume that a civilization like ours that just entered the age of space travel wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have fully overcome resource and energy scarcity. While such a civilization must be thriving and abundant in problem solving technologies and research, it would also be likely to incentivize and foster progress through a credit system. The point being that genetic engineering and space travel as industries and fields of research must be very lucrative and highly incentivized in such a civilization that just made the technological leap of creating the means to travel in space and create new life from scratch.\nThe consistency of the narrative allegedly put forward by Yahweh himself is in the realm of the conceivable. While in our day and age, we clearly haven\u0026rsquo;t achieved nor mastered in the least any of these leaps in technology, these things cannot be considered fictional anymore, but almost seem in reach. Only 50 years ago, when these revelations were made to Raël, the Apollo program just came to put men on the moon and James Watson Francis Crick discovered the double helix structure of the DNA two decades before that. Science and especially applied science has come a long way since, what used to be science-fiction only 50 years ago became reality. Let\u0026rsquo;s just consider for a minute what is possible in the next 50 years, let alone 100 years from now on\u0026hellip;\nTo Earth # The prologue doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. After the genetic experiments became polemic and consequently were halted therefrom on the Elohimian home planet, space exploration lead to new interplanetary and interstellar frontiers. A complete new class of possibilities opened for them.\nRight after the aforementioned passage, Yahweh goes on and adds what ties us to them:\nThey chose Earth where you live.\nEarth, a barren but material planet devoid of life proved to be the frontier they were looking for. Who is they though? They refers to brave ones among the Elohimian civilization that were willing to travel long distances in the vicinity of their home planet and push the boundaries of what was previously considered the realm of the unchartered and the unknown. But who in particular could these brave ones have been? The Raëlian canon does offer partial answers to this question. At this stage of the narration however, let us speculate on the nature of that may have been the incentives to go such great lengths to get a better grip on the matter. These speculations will give us a better understanding of the conditions in which these events evolved in.\nIll. 2 - Archaic blue planet The economy of science # We already pointed out that is reasonable to assume that the Elohimian civilization during that stage of development was likely to still be governed by an economical system predicated on the scarcity of resources and of energy where a credit system must have been in place allocating productive means to those best suited for the job. Also, we know that the public opinion which was responsible for halting the experimental research of genetic engineering had shown enough influence to sway legislative and most likely executive power in their favour. Some sort ofpolitical system with a republic component, where the Rēs pūblica, the matter of the people is considered, can also be assumed.\nWith these two assumptions, which indeed mirror a lot our own economical and political conditions of the 21st century, we can venture to speculate that researchers that were responsible for the research and development of synthetic engineering must have worked on behalf of a quasi-corporative social institution (which we may or may not call an enterprise). That institution must have more likely than not benefitted from the affluence of bright minds and power that came along with their scientific insights.\nOne can only wonder what economical side-effects that kind of promising research must have generated. The capability of reverse engineering genetic code to the extend of being able to write new genetic code as one does write software source code today. The ability to compile and integrate genetic code with nothing but chemical source components as one does transpile source code into machine code today. To fully understand and emulate new features with a given set of decoded genes is not unlike what some tech wizards do when reading source code nowadays and then come up with ways to extend the repository of functionalities with a set of new features. These tech wizards, more commonly referred to as software engineers and software architects, are famous pushing the boundaries of what technology is capable of and make not little of a living out of it.\nIf we extend these principles not only to machine code that is run on digital computing units, but to the machinery that is biological life, the possibilities that can be deduced therefrom are dizzying. Pharmaceutical products of all kinds, the healing of kinds of diseases and life-reducing hardships, the extension of the life span and even the preservation of life itself beyond death become viable. The Elohimian civilization must have truly entered a Golden Age on their own with the development of such technology.\nThe coalition of enterprises that were responsible for the embetterment of life\u0026rsquo;s condition for everybody that was willing to consume and able to afford their products, the confluence of knowledge and power must have been noteworthy to say the least. The circumstance that the legacy of whoever made the progress of genetic engineering possible also is also the foundations of what lead to the creation of synthetic monster that broke free and caused havoc must have been even more noteworthy and likely to be highly polemical in their days.\nNonetheless, the wealth of power generated from the benefits of genetical engineering most likely have had a direct impact on how the Elohimian civilization was funding and allocating resources to the cause of space exploration. The affinity shared by both causes is strongly conducive to the idea that similar agents, to not say individuals, must have contributed to both the these causes.\nIll. 3 - Advanced civilizatory urban landscape The Eternal # At the end of the first book out of the three foundational works of Raëlism, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, Yahweh reveals who he is and what makes him being the main representative of the Elohim:\nThe oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.\nThere we have it. Yahweh was the first one to enjoy the fruits of the scientific progress. The Elohimian civilization developed and perfected a technique that enabled them to inhabit multiple bodies through scientific means, therefore rendering the individuals willing to have this technique applied to them to become veritably immortal. Given the cumulated age of 25'000 years, we can safely park the invention of the techniques of immortality chronologically before the dawn of the Age of Capricorn and therefore before their arrival on planet Earth.\nA quick recap # The Age of Capricorn is one of the twelve World Ages and started at –21'810, lasted as each World Age 2'160 years. Before that period of time, the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, arrived on Earth. Motivated by a tragic incident involving the escape of one of their genetic experiments, which resulted in the loss of Elohimian lifes and the cessation of that branch of research on their home planet, the Elohim sought new interstellar frontiers. Pursuing interplanetary and interstellar exploration, the researchers eventually chose Earth, an exoplanet, as their frontier for genetic research.\nThe establishement of a new exoplanetary frontier on Earth gets the precessional clock work of the unfolding of the World Ages going. With the arrival of the Elohim on planet Earth begins the onset of the Age of Capricorn (from –21'810 to –19'650).\nJurassic Park is a movie that was directed by Steven Spielberg, but it is actually based on a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. The book was first published in 1990, and it tells the story of a theme park that is populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs. The book explores the ethical and scientific implications of genetic engineering, as well as the dangers of playing with nature. The movie adaptation of \u0026ldquo;Jurassic Park\u0026rdquo; was released in 1993, and it was a huge success. The film brought the story of the novel to a wider audience and introduced many people to the concept of genetically engineered dinosaurs. While the movie adaptation of Jurassic Park differs in some ways from the novel, it stays true to the book\u0026rsquo;s themes and explores many of the same ethical and scientific issues.

This epoch marks the arrival of the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, on Earth, following a tragic incident in their genetic experiments. The page also interprets various Biblical passages, particularly from Genesis, suggesting that the term \"Elohim\" refers to beings from the sky who selected Earth for their scientific projects, including the creation of artificial life. This interpretation proposes a different understanding of the Biblical \"days\" as long periods marked by the precessional cycle of the Earth's axis.","content":"We start off with the Age of Capricorn first. The Age of Capricorn is the first precessional Month in the Great Year cycle. With the nominal period of 25'920 years for the precessional Year, the duration of one precessional Month is 2'160 years. During this period, the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox is aligned with the Capricorn constellation in the ecliptic.\nJust as the orbital year, defined by the Earth\u0026rsquo;s revolution around the Sun, is divided into 12 monthly segments, the precessional Year, also known as the Great Year, is divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months. These Great Months are based on a longer cycle called precession, which is the steady change in the orientation of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis.\nTo put it simply, the 25,920-year cycle is divided into 12 segments, each with a corresponding star constellation on the vernal Equinox. This makes the zodiacal houses an appropriate way to date events that span thousands of years, as they are astronomically defined and universally understandable. This is what we call an actual World Age.\nWhile the choice of starting the Timeline with the Age of Capricorn may seem arbitrary, the reasons behind this decision are elaborated in the previous chapter, Preamble # Once upon a time. In the previous chapter, we also learned that right at the onset of the Capricornian Age, the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, arrived on Earth. Motivated by a tragic incident involving the escape of one of their genetic experiments, which resulted in the loss of Elohimian lifes and the cessation of that branch of research on their home planet, the Elohim sought new interstellar frontiers. Pursuing interplanetary and interstellar exploration, the researchers eventually chose Earth, an exoplanet, as their frontier for genetic research.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 21'810 BC as seen from Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface Traces of truth # The first book out of the three foundational works of Raëlism, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, starts out with Yahweh giving an extensive exegetical interpretation of various passages of the Bible. He introduces the Bible as a collection of sacred texts containing accounts of events that are considered to be truthful.\nNow I would like you to refer to the Bible where you will find traces of the truth about your past. These traces, of course, have been somewhat distorted by successive transcribers who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described as being a mystical and supernatural force.\nYahweh provides an interpretation of various Bible passages that reveal the truth about humanity\u0026rsquo;s past, which has been distorted over time due to the lack of understanding of high technology by transcribers.\nOnly the parts of the Bible that I will translate are important. Other parts are merely poetic babblings of which I will say nothing. I am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences.\nYahweh explains that only the portions of the Bible that he has translated are significant.\nThe law of exact reproduction that Yahweh is referring to is likely the practice of preserving the accuracy of the biblical text through copying. In ancient times, before the advent of printing, scribes were responsible for making copies of sacred texts such as the Bible. It was a common practice to copy these texts with the utmost accuracy and attention to detail, without altering even the smallest detail. This was done to preserve the integrity of the text and to prevent errors or changes from being introduced over time. This practice was enforced by religious authorities to ensure that the Bible\u0026rsquo;s message remained unchanged over time.\nYahweh suggests that some parts of the Bible are \u0026ldquo;mystical and futile sentences\u0026rdquo; that have been added over time by successive transcribers who could not comprehend the advanced technology described in the text. It is possible that errors or additions were introduced unintentionally due to the limitations of ancient transcription methods, such as errors in copying, mistranslation, or misinterpretation of the original text on one hand. On the other hand however, certain sentences and texts were most likely added to the Bible for political or religious reasons, or to promote specific beliefs or agendas. Nevertheless, the fundamental message of the Bible has remained intact.\nThe Bible is therefore considered to be a valuable tool for contextualization, as it has been preserved over thousands of years through a meticulous process of transcription and serves as a testimony to historical events.\nGenesis # The Book of Genesis is the first book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. It is a part of the Torah, which is the foundational text of Judaism, and it contains stories and accounts of the creation of the world, the first human beings, the history of early humanity. With Genesis does start the Bible, as well as the first exegetical reading proposed by Yahweh:\nSo let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:\nIn the beginning Elohim1 created the heaven and the earth. Genesis 1: 1.\nElohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew “those who came from the sky”, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. [\u0026hellip;]\nYahweh focuses on the first chapter of Genesis and explains that the Hebrew word Elohim, which is usually translated as God1, actually means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;2 and is clearly written in a plural tense3. This strongly suggests that Elohim refers to the plurality of a people4. More specifically, the people that came from the sky, from another planet, who searched for a suitable planet to carry out their scientific projects.\n[\u0026hellip;] They “created”, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.\nThese extraterrestrial people who discovered the Earth recognized that it contained all the necessary elements to create artificial life. These elements likely included the basic building blocks of life, perhaps referring to elements necessary to build molecules such as amino acids, nucleotides, and other organic compounds. The implication is that these scientists intentionally selected the Earth as a site for their experiments due to its unique chemical makeup and potential for supporting life.\nThe fact that the Earth had a different atmosphere5 than the home planet of these scientists is significant because it suggests that these extraterrestrial beings were unable to adapt themselves biologically to different environments and had to consider to create life that was compatible with Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmospheric conditions. The fact that the Earth had a different atmosphere than the scientists\u0026rsquo; home planet adds to the idea that the creation of life on Earth was a deliberate and highly planned process.\nIll. 1 - Interstellar space travel Blue planet # Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. One of the most prominent features of Earth that can be seen from outer space is the fact that it features water, lots of it.\nAnd the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters. Genesis 1: 2.\nThis means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.\nYahweh explains that this means that the extraterrestrial scientists made reconnaissance flights and placed artificial satellites around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The technology that may have been involved in this description does sound familiar to us.\nFirst, these so-called reconnaissance flights could have taken the form of manned or unmanned spacecraft, such as probes or drones, that were sent to survey the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface and atmosphere.\nSecond, the artificial satellites that were placed around the Earth were likely advanced technological devices that would have been capable of gathering data and transmitting it back to their central space hub. These devices could have taken the form of orbiting satellites or other types of spacecraft that were capable of conducting surveillance and scientific experiments on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere and composition. It\u0026rsquo;s also likely that these artificial satellites were used to gather information about the planet\u0026rsquo;s geological processes, climate patterns, and other environmental factors. These data would have been critical for the extraterrestrial scientists to understand and be able to adapt the Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique environment.\nAnother interesting hint here is what is being said about the state of planet Earth at that moment in time: completely covered in water and thick mist. Planet Earth was indeed a blue planet through and through. The presence of water would have been critical for creating the necessary conditions for life to thrive.\nIll. 2 - Blue planet surface Solar radiation # Not only the Earth, but also another important neighbouring celestial body had to be investigated properly: the Sun. The sun is the star at the center of the solar system and is the primary source of energy for the Earth. The Earth orbits the sun, which means it travels around the sun in a regular and predictable path. The sun\u0026rsquo;s gravitational pull keeps the Earth in orbit and also causes the tides on Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans.\nThe sun also plays a critical role in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and weather patterns, as its energy drives the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmospheric and oceanic circulation systems. The sun\u0026rsquo;s energy is absorbed by the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, land, and oceans, and this energy is then transferred and redistributed around the planet through various physical and chemical processes. Earth has a magnetic field that protects the planet from the solar wind. Solar wind is a stream of charged particles that is constantly emitted by the sun. When the solar wind encounters the Earth\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field, it interacts with the charged particles in the field, causing them to become trapped and redirected around the planet. This forms a protective barrier around the Earth known as the magnetosphere, which shields the planet from the most harmful effects of the solar wind.\nAnd Elohim saw the light, that it was good. Genesis 1: 4.\nTo create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth’s surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the “light was good”.\nYahweh explains that this means that in order to create life on Earth, it was important for the extraterrestrial scientists to research whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. If the sun were sending harmful rays to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, it would have made it much more difficult for the extraterrestrial scientists to create and seed life on the planet. Therefore, researching the sun\u0026rsquo;s effect on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface was critical in determining whether the planet was suitable for life.\nThe sun emits various types of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet (UV) rays, X-rays, and gamma rays, that can be harmful to living organisms. These types of radiation can cause damage to DNA and other molecules, which can lead to mutations or cell death. This would involve studying the effects of different types of radiation emitted by the sun on living organisms. Scientists would use various instruments and methods to measure the intensity and wavelength of radiation reaching the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, as well as how it interacts with the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere and other environmental factors.\nEventually, the sun\u0026rsquo;s output was considered to be acceptable, \u0026ldquo;the light was good\u0026rdquo;, and the investigations continued.\nIll. 3 - Orbital outpost First day of creation # The amount of time it took for the extraterrestrial scientists to research the Earth\u0026rsquo;s environment and determine whether it was suitable for the creation of life took a long while. That period of time is commonly referred to as a day. This day however, as explained in the beginning of this chapter, is not to be substituted with a day and night cycle of 24 hours, but a celestial day that refers to the passage of time of another, much longer cycle: the precession.\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day. Genesis 1: 5.\nThis research took quite some time. The “day” mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.\nAccording to Yahweh, this research took quite some time and the \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; mentioned in Genesis 1:5 corresponds to the period in which the sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, which is roughly 2,000 years on Earth. This suggests that the extraterrestrial scientists spent a significant amount of time studying and analyzing the Earth\u0026rsquo;s environment before seeding it with life.\nThe precession of the equinoxes is a natural phenomenon in which the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis slowly traces out a circle over a period of approximately 26'000 years. A precessional cycle is divided into twelve equal parts, each of which corresponds to a world age that is associated with a different astrological sign. In the case of the first day that passes during which some significant preliminary investigations were undertaken by the space visitors, the Age of Capricorn that lasted from –21'810 to –19'650 is the age that is implicitly referred to.\nA quick recap # The Age of Capricorn is one of the twelve World Ages and lasted from from –21'810 to up –19'650 and took as, each World Age, 2'160 years to complete. It is considered the first World Age out of the twelve World Ages and therefore marks the beginning of the whole cycle of World Ages, as would the month of January mark the beginning of the yearly cycle. It was during the Age of Capricorn that a non-terrestrial civilization arrived to Earth and started investigating it for scientific purposes as it featured all elements necessary for live, above all lots of water.\nThese investigations were considerable in their scope and included extensive probings and examinations of geology, oceonography, and atmospheric sciences, as well an in-depth study of the Sun\u0026rsquo;s impact on Earth. Besides for their purely scientific value, the outcome of these investigations constituted an important data set for the final verdict. The final verdict of whether not the planet could be used as an experimental laboratory for life creational purposes. As we know today, Earth is teeming with life, so we\u0026rsquo;re safe to conclude that the verdict ended up in favour of keeping the outpost and its research endeavours going.\nThe arrival of this space-faring civilization and their subsequent extensive review of the planet is remembered as the First Day of Creation in Genesis. \u0026ldquo;Let there be light\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t refer to the creation of the cosmos or celestial objects, but the planet got discovered and investigated by a number of curious and adventurous cosmonauts.\nAfter the Age of Capricorn (from –21'810 to –19'650) comes the Age of Sagittarius (from –19'650 to –17'490). The Age of Capcricorn equates to the First Day of Creation, the following Age of Sagittarius evidently equates to the Second Day of Creation.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; has its roots in Germanic paganism and Old English, where the term \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; referred to a deity or supreme being. The Germanic word \u0026ldquo;gudan\u0026rdquo; meant \u0026ldquo;to invoke,\u0026rdquo; and the Old English word \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; likely developed from this root. The word \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; is also related to the Latin word \u0026ldquo;Deus,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;deity.\u0026rdquo; This Latin word has its roots in the Proto-Indo-European word \u0026ldquo;dyeus\u0026rdquo;. The divine name Dyēus derives from the stem dyeu-, denoting the \u0026ldquo;diurnal sky\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;brightness of the day\u0026rdquo; (in contrast to the darkness of the night), ultimately from the root *di or dei- (\u0026ldquo;to shine, be bright\u0026rdquo;).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe word Elohim comes from the Biblical Hebrew ʾélôhím (אֱלֹהִים / אֱלוֹהִים), which is the plural form of ʾélôah (אֱלוֹהַּ). This term is an expanded form of ʾēl (אֵל), whose Semitic root is ʾlh or ʾl. Elohim itself is a cognate of the older Akkadian term ilum, which is written with the Sumerogram 𒀭, meaning “sky.” The Semitic root of the Hebrew ʾēl or the Akkadian ilum is ʾl, which is usually understood as “power.” The Sumerogram 𒀭, meaning “sky,” provides a better indication of the original root meaning before it became associated with the powerfulness of these gods that came from the sky.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn Hebrew, the suffix \u0026ldquo;-im\u0026rdquo; is often used to form the plural tense of masculine nouns. For example, the word \u0026ldquo;sefer\u0026rdquo; (סֵפֶר), which means \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; in the singular form, becomes \u0026ldquo;sfarim\u0026rdquo; (סְפָרִים) in the plural form. Similarly, the word \u0026ldquo;chatul\u0026rdquo; (חָתוּל), which means \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; in the singular form, becomes \u0026ldquo;chatulim\u0026rdquo; (חֲתוּלִים) in the plural form. The word Elohim is usually translated as God in English, but it is important to note that it is clearly plural noun in Hebrew. While some scholars like to argue that the plural form of Elohim is a plural of majesty or honor, the undoubtedly clear plural form reflects the ancient Hebrew belief in a pantheon of higher beings.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIt is a common characteristic of ancient religions to have pantheons of gods or goddesses. In many ancient cultures, including Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Norse, there were elaborate pantheons of higher beings that were believed to govern different aspects of the natural world, human affairs, and spiritual life. For example, the Greek pantheon included Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes, Dionysus, and Hestia, among others. Each god or goddess had specific roles and attributes and was associated with different aspects of life, such as love, war, wisdom, or agriculture. Similarly, the ancient Egyptian pantheon included gods and goddesses such as Ra, Osiris, Isis, Horus, Anubis, and Thoth. Each deity had a specific function or aspect of life that they governed, such as the sun, the underworld, or writing and knowledge. The Mesopotamian pantheon included deities such as Anu, Enlil, and Marduk, who were associated with creation, fertility, and kingship, respectively. The Norse pantheon included gods and goddesses such as Odin, Thor, Loki, Freya, and Hel among others.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases such as argon and neon. Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere, while oxygen makes up about 21%. Carbon dioxide and other trace gases make up the remaining 1%.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":"12","href":"/intro/age-of-sagittarius/","title":"Age of Sagittarius","description":"The Age of Sagittarius, spanning from 19,650 to 17,490 BC, is depicted as the second World Age following the Age of Capricorn. It begins with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, having already confirmed Earth's potential for sustaining life, embarking on terraforming activities. This period is allegorically linked to the 'Second Day of Creation' in Genesis, where the division of 'waters above and below the firmament' is interpreted as scientific investigations between Earth's oceanic and atmospheric layers. The culmination of these activities is the creation of a continent from the ocean's seabed through controlled explosions, a significant step towards establishing a permanent presence on Earth​.","content":"The Age of Sagittarius lasts from –19'650 to –17'490 and follows the Age of Capricorn which lasted up to –19'650.\nIn the last chapter, The Age of Capricorn, we learned that a group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers managed to find an exoplanet that provided all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water. The planet they\u0026rsquo;ve found was covered in water and mist, and didn\u0026rsquo;t harbour any life at the moment of its discovery. They went on to build a network of artifical satellites to study the planet. They themselves were orbiting the planet in a what we would call a space station while studying and evaluating the data they were gathering while doing so. Eventually, the data started to become clear in answering the question whether or not the planet would be able to support life and they decided to go on with their work.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Capricorn which lasted from –21'810 to –19'650, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. Another appellation of that period of time, that is known through the Biblical scriptures, is the First Day of Creation. The discovery and subsequent studies of that new exoplanetary world is indeed to be equated with what is being described in the first book of Genesis: \u0026ldquo;And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the planet Earth was deemed good, meaning it not only had all the elements necessary to bear new life, but was also favorable in a series of other, equally important aspects, the second phase begun. The Second Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Sagittarius.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 19'650 BC Water world # In the first book out of the three foundational works of Raëlism, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, Yahweh continues the exegetical interpretation of the Biblical verses.\nAnd Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. Genesis 1: 7.\nAfter studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, “the waters which were above the firmament”, and the ocean covering the whole planet, “the waters which were under the firmament”.\nAccording to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s explanation, this excerpt describes how the scientifical pioneers went on to study cosmic rays above the clouds, and then went below the clouds but remained above the ocean. This literally means they were between the \u0026ldquo;waters above the firmament\u0026rdquo; (the clouds) and the \u0026ldquo;waters below the firmament\u0026rdquo; (the ocean).\nIll. 1 - Research vessel in cloud formations Terraforming Earth # Yahweh then goes on to explain how the first continent was built out of the shallow ocean bed.\nLet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear. Genesis 1: 9.\nAfter they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere. So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent.\nThe quoted text is a reference to the verse from Genesis 1:9, in which the Elohim create dry land by gathering the waters under heaven to one place. This describes quite literally how the scientists studied the sea bed and used explosions to raise matter from the bottom of the seas, piling it up to form a continent.\nThe process described, using explosions to raise matter from the ocean floor and create a landmass, is a form of artificial terraforming1. This is because it involves intentionally modifying the natural environment to create a new land area where there was none before. The process is similar to land reclamation2, where land is created by filling in a body of water, but in this case, the material is obtained by using explosions to bring up material from the ocean floor.\nThe key word here is terraforming. The concept of terraforming is rather a novel notion and emerged as part of the space race in the 20th century, as scientists and engineers began to explore the idea of colonizing other planets and moons in our solar system. While the idea of terraforming remains largely theoretical, it continues to capture the imagination of scientists, writers, and the public alike as a potential way to explore and colonize other worlds. In very broad terms, terraforming refers to the theoretical process of transforming a planet, moon, or other celestial body to make it habitable for humans and other Earth-based life forms. This process typically involves a combination of technologies and processes designed to change the climate, atmosphere, and other environmental conditions of a celestial body in order to make it more like Earth. Terraformation of neighbouring planets such as Mars3 or Venus4 has been envisioned by planetary scientists such as Carl Sagan since the 1960s and has been revisited very recently with the SpaceX Mars program5.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t that exactly what supposedly happened initially here on Earth? In this specific instance, the kind of terraforming applied by the Elohimian scientists would involve intentionally modifying the physical environment of a celestial body (in this case, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s ocean floor) in order to create a new land mass that could potentially support life. The process would likely involve a combination of scientific and engineering techniques, including mapping the ocean floor, analyzing geological data to identify the most suitable areas for land formation, and designing and executing controlled explosions to raise material from the ocean floor. If we imagine how this might have happened, it\u0026rsquo;s within the thinkable that a large number of controlled and coordinated explosions would be necessary to raise enough material from the ocean floor to create a continent. One possibility might have been to use strategically placed explosive charges to fracture the ocean floor in a controlled manner, allowing material to be dislodged and raised to the surface.\nSuch a process would have significant impacts on the topological constitution of the planet and would require careful consideration and planning to minimize undesired long-term or latent side effects. Also, the feasibility of such a process would depend on a number of factors, including the depth and composition of the ocean floor, the availability of suitable materials for land formation, and the technical and logistical challenges of executing such a large-scale project. This must have really been a project of gigantic proportions.\nIll. 2 - Earth-shaping through controlled explosions Pangaea # This single massive supercontinent that got raised from the bottoms of the oceans does sound a lot like the contemporary idea of a supercontinent that supposedly must have existed according to geological insights. This hypothetised supercontient is known as Pangaea6. It is thought to have existed during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, from about 335 to 175 million years ago. It is also thought to have been the most recent of several supercontinents that have formed and broken apart over the course of Earth\u0026rsquo;s history.7\nPangaea was a single, massive landmass that included all of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s major continents at the time, including North America, South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The formation of Pangaea is believed to have been driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which gradually brought the continents together over millions of years.\nIf we assume that a single massive supercontinent were to be raised from the shallow oceans in a scenario like the one described in the passage above, it could very well potentially resemble Pangaea in terms of its size and shape. If we assume that a massive terraforming effort wheere land mass was formed out of the bottom of the oceans could potentially have unintended consequences that lead to the emergence of plate tectonics, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say exactly what those consequences might be. The mechanisms that drive plate tectonics are complex and not fully understood, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to predict how they might be affected by large-scale modifications to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface.\nThat said, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the creation of a large landmass from the ocean floor could potentially alter the balance of forces within the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust and mantle, leading to increased geological activity and the emergence of plate tectonics. This could result in the formation of new land masses, volcanic activity, and other geologic processes that could reshape the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface over time. It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting to ponder the consequences of these terraforming activities.\nIll. 3 - Research installation on barren dry soil Second day of creation # As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, The Age of Sagittarius corresponds to the Biblical Second Day of Creation. The amount of time it took for the extraterrestrial scientists to keep on researching the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceanic and topographic features and to proceed with the terraformation of dry surface area by amassing matter into one spot thus shaping a new supercontinent took a while. That period of time is referred to as a day in the book of Genesis. This day however, as explained in the previous chapter, is not to be substituted with a day and night cycle of 24 hours, but a celestial day that refers to the passage of time during one precession-induced World Age.\nWhile the transition from one task to the other task may be seen as continuous, what matters is to be able to locate a given event, such as the terraformation of a supercontinent, in a frame of time that accounts for long periods of time. The Sagittarian World Age during which the events happened as stated earlier lasted therefore, as any other World Age for that matter, 2'160 years.\nThe Second Day of Creation is described in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 1:6-8. On this day, the Elohim are said to have created the firmament, or the expanse, to separate the waters below from the waters above.\n6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” 7 God made the expanse, and separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse; and it was so. 8 God called the expanse “heaven.” And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. (NASB 2020 🔗)\nAs we know now, the Elohim didn\u0026rsquo;t create the waters above or below the firmament, but simply went on with their scientific investigations to understand the planet Earth better which was covered with thick mist above the planet-wide oceans.\n9 Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of the waters He called “seas”; and God saw that it was good. (NASB 2020 🔗)\nFrom a strictly Biblical point of view, the moment where the Elohim \u0026ldquo;gather the waters below the heavens into one place and for dry land to appear\u0026rdquo; happens after the Second Day has ended. The Raëlian canon is not specific enough to locate the terraformation events in either the second of third World Age after their arrival. For stylistic reasons, we chose to include the terraforming happenings during the Second Day of Creation, during the Age of Sagittarius. These may have endured for a while and have well lasted into the Third Day of Creation.\nA quick recap # The Age of Sagittarius is one of the twelve World Ages and lasted from from –19'650 to up –17'490 and took, as each World Age, 2'160 years to complete. It is considered the second World Age out of the twelve World Ages. This second World Age corresponds to the Second Day of Creation famously mentioned in the Biblical book of Genesis. It was during the Age of Sagittarius that a non-terrestrial civilization that has arrived to Earth a while ago and started to investigate the planet for its ability to sustain life. At some point during their investigations, which showed that the planet Earth indeed predisposed to harbour life, these scientists decided to settle on its grounds. For it lacked any dry ground to land on, they single-handedly they proceeded to terraform such a continent out of the oceans\u0026rsquo; seabed.\nThe terraformation project consisted of a series of controlled subterrain ignitions. These ignitions formed cavities that would act as a type of land reclamation. Ultimately, the product of these terraforming activities gave rise to a landform that itself would lay the basis for dry ground to land and build upon. This made it possible for the extraterrestrial visitors to land and build lasting structures on the surface of the Earth.\nAfter the Age of Sagittarius (from –19'650 to –17'490) comes the Age of Scorpio (from –17'490 to –15'330). After the Capricornian First Day of Creation, the Age of Sagittarius corresponds to the Second Day of Creation, the following Age of Scorpio evidently equates to the Third Day of Creation.\nLand reclamation is the process of creating new land from the sea. The simplest method of land reclamation involves simply filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or cement, then filling with clay and soil until the desired height is reached.

It usually also includes the modification of atmosphere or temperature to make an initially inhospitable planet habitable. See here for more: Terraforming | Wikipedia\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTerraforming Mars refers to the theoretical process of transforming the Martian environment to make it more hospitable and habitable for human life. The goal of terraforming Mars is to create an environment that is similar enough to Earth that humans could live there without the need for protective equipment or artificial habitats.

Venus is often considered an extreme and challenging target for terraforming, as its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and its atmosphere is incredibly thick and acidic.

See here more fore: Pangaea | Wikipedia\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe existence of the supercontinent Pangaea is based on evidence from geology, including the distribution of fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges on different continents. The theory of plate tectonics explains how the movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s plates caused Pangaea to break apart and its continents to drift apart. The estimated age of this remote supercontinent Pangaea is a product of assuming the so-called Uniformitarianism because the theory of plate tectonics and the concept of Pangaea are fundamental to the Uniformitarian Doctrine. This doctrine assumes that the processes and natural laws that operate in the present have operated in the same way throughout the history of the Earth.

Following the terraforming achievements of the Age of Sagittarius, this epoch is characterized by the Elohim scientists' efforts in synthetic biology on the newly formed supercontinent. They focused on creating vegetation, including various types of plants capable of reproduction, thereby initiating the first steps towards a diverse ecosystem on Earth. Their work, combining scientific prowess with artistic influence, sought to create a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing natural world. This period is crucial in the narrative for laying the foundations of life as we know it, marking a significant transition from terraforming to life creation​​.","content":"The Age of Scorpio lasts from –17'490 to –15'330 and follows the Age of Sagittarius which lasted up to –17'490.\nIn the last chapter, The Age of Sagittarius, we learned that the group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers who managed to find an exoplanet that provided all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water, studied the planet well enough to capitalize on its capacity to harbour life. The whole planet was covered in water, so they went on to build new outposts on the surface these oceans and kept studying and surveying the constitution of this new planet, especially its ocean and the bottom of it. Eventually, they realized they could terraform a dry land mass by piling up matter from the bottom of the ocean in one place. A single gigantic land mass emerged through the terraformation.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Sagittarius which lasted from –19'650 to –17'490, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. As we learned with the Age of Capricorn, which represents the First Day of Creation mentioned in the first book of Genesis, the Age of Sagittarius as the subsequent World Age is therefore representing the Second Day of Creation. The Bible describes the terraformation very eloquently as wollows: “Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.”\nWith the newly terraformed supercontinent, the Elohimian scientists could land on firm soil and build permanent structures; the third phase could begin. The Third Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Scorpio.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 17'490 BC Directed abiogenesis # Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth. Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe quoted text is a reference to Genesis 1:11, in which the Elohimian scientists create vegetation on Earth. These scientists create plant cells from chemicals in a laboratory setting, with the goal of producing different types of plants. The scientists\u0026rsquo; focus was on reproduction, and they worked to create cells that could eventually reproduce on their own.\nThe creation of synthetic life involves the design and engineering of biological systems that can perform specific functions or exhibit specific behaviors. In the context of the passage, the scientists are creating plant cells from chemicals in a laboratory setting, which is a type of synthetic life engineering.\nThis type of engineering involves using techniques from various fields, including genetics, molecular biology, and bioengineering, to create artificial organisms or biological systems that did not exist on the Elohimian home planet before. To create synthetic life, these scientists need a thorough understanding of the molecular and genetic processes that underpin life. This includes knowledge of DNA replication, gene expression, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. They also require access to advanced tools and techniques for manipulating DNA and other biomolecules, such as CRISPR/Cas91 gene editing. Other advanced techniques such as synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and protein engineering have also been developed to enable scientists to engineer new biological systems and molecules with specific functions.\nThe creation of synthetic life through engineering can be considered a type of directed abiogenesis, as it involves the deliberate design and creation of new forms of life using chemical and biological processes. Abiogenesis refers to the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, and directed abiogenesis involves actively guiding and controlling this process to achieve specific outcomes.\nIn synthetic life engineering, scientists are using their understanding of the principles of life to create new biological systems and organisms that do not exist in nature. This involves the design and construction of synthetic DNA and other biomolecules, as well as the development of new techniques for manipulating and controlling biological systems.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to speculate on how a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization such as the Elohim might create synthetic life ex nihilo (from nothing), as we cannot be certain what their technological capabilities and limitations might have been in that moment in time. However, we can imagine some general strategies that the Elohim might have employed based on our current understanding of synthetic biology and genome engineering.\nOne possible approach to creating synthetic life ex nihilo might involve using advanced tools for genome engineering, such as CRISPR/Cas9 or other gene editing systems as mentioned before, to manipulate the genetic code of simple organisms such as bacteria or yeast. By carefully engineering the genome of these organisms, the Elohimian scientists could potentially create entirely new biological systems with novel functions and behaviors.\nAnother approach might involve designing and synthesizing artificial DNA and other biomolecules that could be used to build entirely new biological systems from scratch. This would require a deep understanding of the underlying principles of life, as well as advanced techniques for synthesizing complex biomolecules and designing self-assembling systems.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also possible that a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization might employ computational methods to design and simulate synthetic biological systems before actually building them. Computer simulations and modeling can be used to predict the behavior of complex biological systems, and could help extraterrestrial scientists to identify optimal designs and avoid potential pitfalls.\nAs for now, we must satisfy ourselves with mere speculations as we cannot fathom what incredible knowledge and technologies these early Elohimian scientists must have wielded to synthetize new life forms.\nIll. 1 - Genetic research lab with water supplies Intelligent Design # Not only can this process be considered directed abiogenesis, but is also a subtype of Intelligent Design. Intelligent Design is a concept that argues that certain features of the natural world are best explained by the intervention of an intelligent designer or creator, rather than through natural processes such as evolution. Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that there are certain biological structures and systems that are too complex to have evolved through natural selection and therefore must have been designed by a higher power.\nIntelligent Design argues that certain features of the natural world, such as the complexity and functionality of living organisms, are best explained by the intervention of an intelligent designer or creator. Proponents of Intelligent Design often use analogies to computer programming to support their argument, such as the idea that the DNA code that governs the development of living organisms is analogous to a software program. This kind of paradigm argues that the information content of the genetic code, and the complex biological systems that it controls, cannot be explained by natural processes such as evolution, but instead require the intervention of an intelligent agent or designer.\nFor instance, the intelligent agent is often considered a type of coder as biological life is thought to feature an information layer that is considered unaccounted for by more popular explanations such as evolution. DNA is often compared to computer programs because both are systems of information storage and processing that rely on a digital code. DNA is a long, linear molecule that consists of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the genetic code. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes information that directs the development, function, and behavior of living organisms. Computer programs, similarly, are a set of instructions written in a digital language that directs the function of a computer. Computer programs consist of a series of code that is stored in binary form, consisting of 0s and 1s that represent the basic building blocks of digital information. Both DNA and computer programs rely on a digital code, where the sequence of individual units (nucleotides or binary digits) determines the overall function and behavior of the system. In the case of DNA, the sequence of nucleotides determines the sequence of amino acids that make up proteins, which in turn determine the structure and function of cells and tissues in the body.\nIntelligent Design is often associated with creationism, which is the belief that the Earth and all living things were created by a divine entity, as described in religious texts. Most Intelligent Design proponents have a Christian background and therefore equate the Designer to besame as the Creator God of the Christian exegesis of the Bible. While the process of creating synthetic life involves deliberate design and engineering, it is based on natural principles and the laws of physics and chemistry however. The goal of synthetic life engineering is to understand and replicate the natural processes that underlie life, rather than to invoke any kind of supernatural or religious explanation for the origin of life.\nIll. 2 - Geodesic research structures on grassland Game of Life # [\u0026hellip;] The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.\nThe extraterrestrial scientists created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate of the continent they were exploring. They worked in small research teams and met regularly to compare their progress. The people on their own planet followed their work with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists joined the scientists to create decorative and pleasing plants with unique appearances and fragrances.\nThey may use advanced techniques for genome engineering and biomolecule synthesis to create plants with desired traits, such as drought resistance or colorful blooms, and then modify these plants further over time to optimize their performance in the local environment. In terms of the involvement of artists in the scenario, this could suggest that aesthetics and creativity are valued as highly as functionality and practicality in the design and creation of synthetic life forms. The artists may use their skills to design plants with unique appearances and fragrances, using colors, textures, and patterns to create a visually appealing and harmonious environment. They may also work with the scientists to identify plants with particularly interesting or useful features, and then modify these plants further to enhance their aesthetic qualities. The involvement of artists in the scenario raises interesting questions about the relationship between art and science, and the potential role of aesthetics in the design and creation of synthetic life forms. It suggests that the creation of new life forms could be viewed as a form of art, with the aim of not only creating useful and functional organisms, but also aesthetically pleasing and visually stunning ones.\nAs Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s explanation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide specific details about the different climates, we can only speculate about what they might have looked like. Depending on the size of the continent and its location on the globe, the different climates could range from arid deserts to lush tropical rainforests, from icy tundras to windy steppes.\nEach of these climates would present unique challenges and opportunities for the extraterrestrial scientists in terms of the types of plants they could create and the adaptations required for those plants to survive in their respective environments. In a desert climate, for example, the plants may need to be adapted to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures, while in a rainforest climate they may need to be adapted to compete with other plant species for resources such as sunlight and water. In a polar climate, where temperatures are consistently below freezing, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate extreme cold and snow. These plants may need to be adapted to conserve energy during long periods of darkness and to withstand strong winds. In a tropical climate, where temperatures are consistently warm and rainfall is abundant, the scientists may need to create plants that can grow quickly and compete for resources such as sunlight and water. These plants may also need to be adapted to resist pests and diseases that thrive in humid conditions. In a mountainous climate, where temperatures can vary widely depending on altitude, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations and low oxygen levels at high elevations. These plants may also need to be adapted to rocky terrain and steep slopes. In a coastal climate, where saltwater spray and high winds can be common, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate salt and moisture. These plants may need to be adapted to sandy soils and to resist damage from high winds and storms.\nIn other words, the specific characteristics of the different climates would require the Elohimian scientists to create plants with a wide range of adaptations and traits, based on the specific challenges and opportunities presented by each environment.\nIll. 3 - Primordial jungle featuring a researcher Third day of creation # As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, The Age of Scorpio corresponds to the Biblical Third Day of Creation. The period of time during which the extraterrestrial scientists were erecting terrestrial residential buildings and scientific research installations was indeed the Scorpionian Age. As we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the previous chapter, The Age of Sagittarius, a supercontinent got formed out of the seabed by amassing matter from the bottom of the oceans in a given place, ultimately forming dry land that surpassed the sea level. It is on that newly formed dry land that these terrestrial structures were built upon, truly deserving the descriptor \u0026ldquo;terrestrial\u0026rdquo;, on the earthy soil of the planet Earth. What succeeded was the beginning of what we commonly think of when we say Genesis. Genesis as in the creation of the very life that we see all around us. This Genesis project started with the engineering of simple cells from scratch. After the cells were successfully created, more complex organisms followed, organisms such as plants. All of this happaned during the Third Day of Creation, during the Age of Scorpio, a World Age that is situated between 17'490—15'330 BC.\nThe Third Day of Creation is described in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 1:9-13. The Elohim are said to have gathered the waters under the heaven into one place, forming the dry land, which is called \u0026ldquo;Earth,\u0026rdquo; and the gathering together of the waters is called \u0026ldquo;Seas.\u0026rdquo; The Elohim then commanded the Earth to bring forth vegetation, including grass, herbs, and fruit-bearing trees.\n11 Then God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them”; and it was so. 12 The earth produced vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, according to their kind; and God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\nWe can cleary read into what is being said here: \u0026ldquo;Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them\u0026rdquo;. The fact that reproduction is highlighted as much in the Biblical Genesis story exhibits how this feature was of capital importance to these extraterrestrial scientists when they started out creating the first artifical organisms, namely organisms that were inherently capable of reproducing themselves, needing no further intervention from outside to preserve the continuity of their existence. \u0026ldquo;And it was so.\u0026rdquo; They managed to implement this crucial feature with success, most likely taking life from their home planet as a blueprint template. The Elohim \u0026ldquo;saw that it was good\u0026rdquo;. Patience paid off, after two full World Ages lasting for more than 4'000 Earthly years culminated in the ability to finally start with the serious work that got banned on their home planet, and their perseverance bore fruits.\nA quick recap # The Age of Scorpio is linked to the Biblical Third Day of Creation. During this time, which corresponds to a period between 17,490–15,330 BC, extraterrestrial scientists are said to have built terrestrial residential buildings and scientific research installations on the newly formed dry land, as described in the Book of Genesis 1:9-13.\nThe creation of life as we know it started with the engineering of simple cells, followed by more complex organisms such as plants. The fact that reproduction is emphasized in the Biblical Genesis story suggests that this feature was crucial for these extraterrestrial scientists when creating the first artificial organisms. They aimed to create organisms capable of reproducing themselves without the need for further intervention.\nAfter the Age of Scorpio (from –17'490 to –15'330) comes the Age of Libra (from –15'330 to –13'170). As we\u0026rsquo;ve identified the Days of Creation being each a World Age based on the cycle of precession, the following Age of Libra corresponds to the Fourth Day of Creation.\nGene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 are a group of powerful tools that would allow potential scientists to precisely modify the genetic code of living organisms. These technologies work by using specialized proteins to cut and modify specific sections of DNA, allowing researchers to add, delete, or replace genes with great accuracy.

As soon as they managed to terraform a new barren continental land mass out of the bottom of the oceans, they went on to synthetize plant life. This plant life was engineered from nothing else but chemical base elements. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take them long to cover the new supercontinent with grass, saplings, shrubs and other greeneries. The engineers were joined by artists and formed various research groups that each focused on a different region of this supercontinent to diversify and sophisticate further the newly created flora.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Scorpio which lasted from –17'490 to –15'330, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. As we learned with the preceedings World Ages, which each represented one of the Days of Creation as mentioned in the first book of Genesis, the Age of Libra as the subsequent World Age is considered the Fourth Day of Creation.\nWith the research groups having split up and while exploring the prospective creative possibilities of having a whole planet to themselves, the Elohimian scientists had all the freedom in their hands to fully take advantage of their situation. Earth was a sandbox environment of engineering, research and artistic expression. It was time to settle further and better understand the environment they were in; the fourth phase could begin. The Fourth Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Libra.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 15'330 BC Regulation # Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. Genesis 1: 14.\nBy observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.\nYahweh states here that lights in the sky, such as stars and the sun, serve to differentiate day and night, and to mark signs, seasons, days, and years. Observing these celestial bodies allowed the Elohimian pioneers to measure time on Earth and adapt to the differing duration of days and years compared to their original planet. Studying astronomy helped them better understand and navigate their new environment on Earth.\nWe know that the Elohim, the Celestials that came from the sky, originate from a different planet. We\u0026rsquo;re only so far in narrating the overarching story, not a lot is known yet about the Elohimian home planet. In the excerpt above, we learned that the duration of the day and night cycle as well as the duration of the year is different on their home planet than here on Earth. For reasons that we won\u0026rsquo;t go into here, let\u0026rsquo;s be said that there are reasons to believe that they day and night cycle would be much longer on the Elohimian home planet.\nIf we speculate on what would have been seen as different in direct comparaison of their home planet and the new Earthly frontier world they were exploring at that moment in time, several differences in the night sky and the pace of various astronomical cycles could have been observed. The arrangement of stars visible from their planet would likely be different, resulting in unique constellations and celestial landmarks compared to those on Earth. Their planet might have a different number of moons or other visible celestial bodies, which could influence tides, illumination during the night, and other phenomena.\nThe rotation period of their planet might be different from Earth\u0026rsquo;s, leading to longer or shorter days and nights. Their planet\u0026rsquo;s orbit around its star might also be shorter or longer than Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, affecting the duration of a year and the pace of seasonal changes. If their planet has a different axial tilt compared to Earth, the intensity and duration of seasons could differ as well.\nThe Elohimian planet could orbit a star different from our Sun, such as a red dwarf or a binary star system. This would affect the amount and type of light received on the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface, as well as the pace of various astronomical cycles. Additionally, a different magnetic field strength could lead to unique auroras, different levels of cosmic radiation, and other effects on their planet\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere.\nThese differences would affect the way the Elohimian scientists perceive and measure time, as well as their understanding of astronomy and celestial events. Adapting to Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique cycles and celestial phenomena would be crucial for their successful integration and navigation on our planet.\nIll. 1 - Geodetic installation by the ocean Adaptation # The new Earthly planet could offer a range of different possibilities. We learned in the previous chapter how new plant life was created ex-nihilo from base elements, the Elohimian scientists would face a unique opportunity to design and shape the planet\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems from scratch. This would allow them to build a completely new biosphere, with a careful balance of plants, fungi and other small life forms such as insects and worms, that could thrive in Earth\u0026rsquo;s specific environmental conditions.\nCreating Earth-specific plant life ex-nihilo would involve designing plants that could efficiently harness energy from the Sun through photosynthesis, and have the necessary adaptations to survive and reproduce in different climates and habitats. These engineered plants would form the basis of Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems, providing the essential foundation for food chains and nutrient cycles.\nOnce the flora would be established, the scientists would be able to introduce various fauna, designed to interact with the plants and with one another in a harmonious manner. This would involve the possibility of creating herbivores to consume the plants, carnivores to regulate herbivore populations, and decomposers to recycle nutrients back into the environment. The balance of these species would be crucial in maintaining a stable and functioning ecosystem.\nThe Elohimian scientists would also have the opportunity to design Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems in such a way that they are resilient to disturbances and can adapt to changing conditions over time. This could involve creating species with high genetic diversity, fostering symbiotic relationships between different organisms, and ensuring that ecosystems have redundancies and backups for key ecological processes.\nThe synthetic engineering of plant life on a new Earthly planet could significantly benefit from the knowledge gained through observing the sky and understanding one\u0026rsquo;s location. This knowledge would provide valuable information about the specific environmental conditions that the engineered plants would need to adapt to, and help guide the design of these plants to ensure their success in the new ecosystem.\nUnderstanding day-night cycles through sky observation would enable the scientists to design plants that can efficiently utilize available sunlight for photosynthesis. They could tailor the plants\u0026rsquo; light-harvesting mechanisms and growth patterns to match the duration and intensity of sunlight received in different parts of the planet.\nBy studying the movements of celestial bodies, scientists could also gain insight into Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and seasonal variations. This knowledge would be crucial in engineering plants that can tolerate temperature fluctuations and adapt to the changing availability of water and nutrients throughout the year. Additionally, understanding how seasonal changes impact pollinator activity could help inform the development of plants with appropriate flowering and fruiting periods to maximize reproductive success.\nPrecise location information, derived from astronomical observations, would allow scientists to map out the different biomes and habitats present on Earth. This knowledge would enable them to engineer plant species that are specifically adapted to the unique environmental conditions of each biome, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil composition.\nMonitoring the sky could also help scientists predict and prepare for natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or meteor impacts, which could significantly affect the survival of the engineered plant life. By understanding the potential risks and incorporating resilience strategies into the design of the plants, they could increase the likelihood of their successful establishment and long-term survival on the new Earthly planet.\nIll. 2 - Primordial botany featuring two researchers Earth in motion # Several key astronomical cycles, which are influenced by Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique properties, govern various aspects of our planet\u0026rsquo;s behavior and environment.\nOne of the most fundamental cycles is the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation, which creates the day-night cycle. As Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the planet are exposed to sunlight, resulting in alternating periods of daylight and darkness. This cycle has a significant impact on temperature, weather patterns, and the behavior of living organisms.\nAnother important astronomical cycle is Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, which takes approximately 365.25 days to complete. This cycle, combined with Earth\u0026rsquo;s axial tilt of roughly 23.5 degrees, results in the changing of the seasons. As Earth moves around the Sun, the angle at which sunlight strikes different parts of the planet changes, leading to variations in temperature, daylight duration, and weather conditions.\nThe axial tilt of Earth also leads to the cycle of solstices and equinoxes. The solstices mark the longest and shortest days of the year, while the equinoxes occur when day and night have equal lengths. These events are caused by Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilted axis and its position relative to the Sun during its orbit.\nIn addition to these cycles, the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit around Earth gives rise to several cycles that influence our planet. The most notable of these is the lunar cycle, which lasts approximately 29.5 days. This cycle causes the Moon to go through different phases, from new moon to full moon, as its position relative to Earth and the Sun changes. The lunar cycle has a strong influence on tides, with higher tides occurring during full and new moons due to the combined gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun.\nAnother lunar cycle is the lunar nodal cycle, which lasts about 18.6 years. This cycle affects the angle of the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit relative to Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator, influencing the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses. When the nodes of the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit align with the Sun, eclipses can occur.\nThese astronomical cycles are crucial in shaping the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate, ecosystems, and the behavior of living organisms. Understanding these cycles allows us to predict and prepare for various natural events, as well as to better comprehend the complex interactions that occur on our planet.\nSeveral key astronomical cycles, which are influenced by Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique properties, govern various aspects of our planet\u0026rsquo;s behavior and environment.\nOne of the most fundamental cycles is the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation, which creates the day-night cycle.

Precession has been explained multiple times during the Introduction because it plays a key role in retelling of the Elohimian chronicles with an accurate time marker. Precession, often referred to as the precession of the equinoxes, is the gradual change in the orientation of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. It is caused by the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge. This slow, wobbling motion of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis takes approximately 25'920 years (modern day estimations amount to 25'772 years) to complete a full cycle.\nAs a result of precession, the position of the celestial poles (the points in the sky that the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis points towards) gradually shifts over time. This means that the pole stars, which are currently Polaris in the Northern Hemisphere and Sigma Octantis in the Southern Hemisphere, change over thousands of years. For example, around the year 14'000 CE, the bright star Vega will become the new North Star.\nPrecession also impacts the timing of the solstices and equinoxes. Over the course of the 25'920-year cycle, the positions of the Sun along the ecliptic at the time of the solstices and equinoxes gradually shift. This has a subtle effect on the length of the seasons and the timing of the solstices and equinoxes, with each season slowly changing its duration.\nUnderstanding Earth\u0026rsquo;s various cycles such as the precession allowed the Elohimian scientists to study long-term astronomical changes, which can have implications for climate and ecosystems.\nFourth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"15","href":"/intro/age-of-virgo/","title":"Age of Virgo","description":"The Age of Virgo, lasting from 13,170 to 11,010 BC, marks a significant period in the Wheel of Heaven narrative, following the Age of Libra.

The process began with the creation of plankton, small and large fish, and seaweed to establish a balanced aquatic ecosystem. This development mirrors modern ecological principles. Additionally, this era saw the introduction of birds, with artists playing a key role in designing their diverse forms and vibrant colors. However, some designs were so elaborate that they impacted the birds' flight abilities. Notably, this period also included the creation of large, fearsome creatures resembling dragons, dinosaurs, and brontosaurs, acknowledging the earlier opposition to such ambitious creation plans on the scientists' home planet​​​​.","content":"The Age of Virgo lasts from –13'170 to –11'010 and follows the Age of Libra which lasted up to –13'170.\nFig. 2 - Vernal equinox in 13'170 BC Aquatic and bird kingdoms # Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens. Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn. Thus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as “ecology”, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals. [\u0026hellip;]\nIll. 1 - Oceanium laboratory installation under water In Genesis 1:20, the waters are filled with an abundance of living creatures, and birds are created to fly above the Earth. The first aquatic animals were created, starting from plankton and small fish to larger fish, along with seaweed to maintain balance in the ecosystem. This allowed smaller fish to feed on seaweed while bigger fish could eat the smaller fish, ensuring that one species wouldn\u0026rsquo;t destroy another for survival. This process is similar to modern-day \u0026ldquo;ecology.\u0026rdquo; The scientists and artists involved in these creations often held competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or interesting animals.\nIll. 2 - Fauna and flora Artistic expression # [\u0026hellip;] After the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome. The contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe creation of birds followed the creation of fish, with artists heavily involved in designing their diverse forms and vibrant colors. The focus on aesthetics led to some birds having difficulty flying due to their cumbersome feathers. Competitions expanded to include not only physical attributes but also the animals\u0026rsquo; behavior, especially the intricate mating dances they performed.\nCreating birds with a strong focus on aesthetics and unique behaviors, such as elaborate mating rituals, would involve genetic engineering to manipulate specific genes responsible for physical traits and behavioral patterns. Scientists would need to identify and modify genes that control feather development, coloration, and patterns to create visually stunning birds. Similarly, they would need to understand and alter the genetic basis for the behaviors associated with mating rituals, such as courtship displays and dances.\nIll. 3 - Palatial bird with lots of decorative features Jurassic origins # [\u0026hellip;] Some other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nIn the creation process, certain groups of scientists designed fearsome creatures resembling monsters, such as dragons or what we know as dinosaurs and brontosaurs. These creations validated the concerns of those who had initially opposed the creation plans on the scientists\u0026rsquo; home planet.\nIn this context, dinosaurs, a diverse group of reptiles, would represent an earlier stage of synthetic life experimentation on Earth, with their unique physical features and behaviors potentially serving as a showcase of the scientists\u0026rsquo; capabilities in designing life forms. They were unique in their upright posture, with legs positioned directly beneath their bodies, unlike other reptiles that have sprawling limbs. This allowed dinosaurs to be more energy-efficient and agile, giving them an advantage in their environment.\nThe size of dinosaurs varied greatly, from small chicken-sized creatures to gigantic sauropods that reached lengths of over 30 meters. They were terrestrial animals and inhabited a range of ecosystems, from forests and plains to coastal regions and deserts. Dinosaurs can be broadly classified into two major groups: the Saurischia, which includes the theropods (carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex) and the sauropods (large, long-necked herbivores like the Brachiosaurus), and the Ornithischia, which includes the herbivorous, bird-hipped dinosaurs such as the Triceratops and Stegosaurus.\nSome dinosaurs exhibited remarkable adaptations, such as sharp teeth and claws for hunting or long necks for reaching vegetation in high places. They also featured various defense mechanisms, like bony plates, spikes, and frills, to protect themselves from predators. The reproductive strategy of dinosaurs involved laying eggs, and many species built nests to protect and incubate their offspring. Their legacy lives on through the birds, which are considered to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs and have evolved from small, feathered theropod dinosaurs.\nIll. 4 - Pod of brontosaurs grazing on meadowland Fifth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"16","href":"/intro/age-of-leo/","title":"Age of Leo","description":"The Age of Leo, spanning from 11,010 to 8,850 BC, follows the Age of Virgo in the Wheel of Heaven narrative.

A significant development during this age was the creation of artificial human beings, resembling the extraterrestrial scientists themselves. This led to controversy on their home planet due to fears that these new beings might surpass their creators in capabilities. Consequently, the newly created humans were left to live primitively, without scientific knowledge, and each human race is said to correspond to a team of creators​​​​.","content":"The Age of Leo lasts from –11'010 to –8'850 and follows the Age of Virgo which lasted up to –11'010.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 11010 BC Animal kingdom # Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind. Genesis 1: 24.\nAfter marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.\nIn the quoted passage from the Raëlian book \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells the Truth,\u0026rdquo; it is explained that scientists from another planet, including the speaker (Yahweh), created various forms of life on Earth. After developing marine organisms and birds, they focused on land animals. Initially, they created herbivores, supported by the already flourishing vegetation. To maintain ecological balance, carnivores were later introduced. The ultimate goal of these extraterrestrial scientists was to establish a harmonious ecological order on Earth.\nEngineering a balanced ecological order is a complex process that involves understanding and manipulating various factors and components of an ecosystem. To create such an order, one must first study existing ecosystems, gaining insight into their structure, function, and the relationships between various living organisms and their environment. A key aspect of this process is identifying keystone species, which play a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of an ecosystem. By introducing these species into an engineered ecosystem, it is possible to establish the foundation for a balanced ecological order.\nDesigning a stable food web and considering trophic interactions are also important factors in engineering an ecological order. This involves ensuring the presence of primary producers, such as plants, which form the base of the food web, as well as herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers. It is crucial to maintain the right balance of these species to prevent overpopulation or depletion of resources. Another aspect of creating a balanced ecological order is managing population dynamics. This includes monitoring and controlling the growth and decline of different species to maintain equilibrium in the ecosystem. This may involve using natural predators, introducing new species, or implementing population control measures.\nHabitat creation and restoration are also essential in engineering an ecological order. Providing suitable living conditions and resources for various species is vital for their survival and well-being. This includes creating and preserving diverse habitats, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and aquatic environments. Ongoing monitoring and adaptive management are necessary for maintaining a balanced ecological order. By regularly assessing the health and stability of the engineered ecosystem, adjustments can be made to address any imbalances or issues that arise. This could include reintroducing species, removing invasive species, or altering habitat conditions to better support the ecosystem\u0026rsquo;s overall health.\nIll. 2 - Struggle between a lion and a crocodile The Elohim scientists, with their advanced scientific knowledge and expertise in genetic engineering, would have likely approached the creation of a balanced ecological order by first studying the biology and characteristics of various organisms. They may have started by creating simpler life forms, such as single-celled organisms, and observed their interactions and impact on the environment. As they gained more understanding of these life forms, they might have introduced more complex organisms, such as plants and simple animals, while monitoring their interactions with one another and the environment. This would have allowed them to better understand the ecological dynamics and the requirements for creating a stable ecosystem.\nWith this knowledge, they could have gradually introduced more advanced and specialized species, including herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, while ensuring that these species played specific roles in the ecosystem. They would have focused on establishing functional relationships between these species to maintain a balanced food web, ensuring that the energy and nutrients flowed throughout the system efficiently. To create the wide variety of animal species we see today, the Elohim scientists might have used their expertise in genetic engineering to adapt existing species to various habitats and conditions. This would have led to the development of species with unique adaptations suited for different environments, such as desert-dwelling animals, aquatic species, and high-altitude creatures.\nThroughout the process, they would have paid close attention to population dynamics, ensuring that the population sizes of various species remained within sustainable limits. They may have achieved this by introducing natural predators or through other means of population control. The Elohim scientists would have been involved in ongoing monitoring and adaptive management, adjusting their approach as needed to maintain a balanced ecological order. This could have included reintroducing species, removing invasive species, or modifying habitat conditions to support the overall health of the ecosystem.\nIll. 1 - Elephant walking the Earth Homo genesis # It was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making “test tube children” who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.\nIn this passage from the book, Yahweh describes how the most skilled scientists among them wanted to create artificial human beings resembling themselves. Different teams worked on the project, and soon they were able to compare their creations. However, people on their home planet were alarmed by the idea of \u0026ldquo;test tube children,\u0026rdquo; fearing that these new humans could become a threat if they possessed superior mental capacities or powers. Consequently, the scientists agreed to let the new humans live primitively without any scientific knowledge and concealed their true intentions. Each race on Earth is said to correspond to a team of creators, seven in total.\nWhile we can only speculate about the reasons for the Elohim civilization\u0026rsquo;s outrage, some possible factors might include the fear of losing control. The Elohim civilization may have been concerned that the creation of artificial human beings with superior mental capacities or powers could lead to a potential loss of dominance over these new beings, undermining their authority. Another concern could have been the potential risks associated with creating new life forms. The Elohim civilization might have worried about the unintended consequences of their actions, such as the possibility of the new humans disrupting the natural balance of ecosystems or causing other unforeseen problems.\nAdditionally, ethical considerations could have played a role in the outrage. The creation of artificial human beings might have been viewed as playing with life, which could be seen as morally questionable or as infringing on the sanctity of life. This could have led to debates and disagreements within the Elohim civilization over the ethical implications of their actions. Also, the Elohim civilization could have feared the potential cultural, social, or political impact of introducing these new human beings. The presence of beings with superior mental capacities or powers could have led to clashes between the new humans and the Elohim civilization, or even the potential for conflict between different factions within the Elohim society.\nThe outrage and concerns from the Elohim civilization about creating artificial human beings likely led to intense discussions and debates within their society. To address these concerns and alleviate fears, the Elohim scientists might have reached a compromise that allowed them to continue their experiment but with certain limitations imposed on the new humans. By letting the new humans live primitively without any scientific knowledge, the Elohim civilization could have effectively limited their potential to develop advanced technologies and pose a threat to their creators. This approach would have also mitigated concerns about the new humans surpassing their creators in terms of mental capacities or powers.\nFurthermore, keeping the new humans in a primitive state would have enabled the Elohim civilization to maintain control over them and monitor their development more effectively. This would have provided a sense of security for the Elohim, knowing that they could intervene or make adjustments if any issues arose. Concealing their true intentions from the new humans would have helped the Elohim maintain an air of mystique and authority, potentially making it easier for them to guide and influence the development of these beings without revealing the full extent of their involvement.\nLet Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. Genesis 1: 26.\n“In our image!” You can see that the resemblance is striking. That is when the trouble started for us.\nIn this passage from the book, Yahweh quotes Genesis 1:26, which states the intention to create humans in their image and likeness, giving them dominion over other living creatures on Earth. Yahweh highlights the striking resemblance between humans and their creators. The passage also suggests that this point in the story marked the beginning of troubles for the Elohim scientists.\nWhen the passage states that human beings on Earth were made in the image of the Elohim and were look-alikes, it implies that humans were created to physically resemble their creators, sharing similar physical traits and characteristics. This might include aspects like body shape, facial features, and other physical attributes, suggesting that the Elohim and humans have a common appearance. Additionally, being created in the image of the Elohim could also mean that humans were designed to possess certain cognitive and emotional attributes similar to those of their creators. This might encompass aspects like intelligence, self-awareness, creativity, and the capacity for emotions, making humans distinct from other living creatures on Earth.\nThe concept of humans being made in the image of the Elohim could also carry a deeper philosophical or spiritual meaning, possibly suggesting that humans share a unique bond or connection with their creators. This might imply that humans have the potential to understand and appreciate the values, knowledge, or wisdom of the Elohim.\nIll. 3 - Humanoid in a cultivation pod Garden of Eden # The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all. Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call “paradise on Earth”. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.\nIn this passage, Yahweh explains that the team of creators situated in what is now known as Israel, close to Greece and Turkey at the time, were perhaps the most talented of all. They created beautiful animals, fragrant plants, and the most intelligent humans in a paradise-like environment on Earth. However, to prevent these humans from surpassing their creators, it was necessary to keep them unaware of major scientific secrets while still educating them to gauge their intelligence.\nUnderstanding the paradise-like environment in the passage as the Biblical Garden of Eden, we can explore the similarities and connections between the two. The Garden of Eden, as described in the Bible, was a perfect and idyllic place, abundant with beautiful plants, animals, and resources. Similarly, the environment mentioned in the passage is referred to as \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth,\u0026rdquo; with the most beautiful animals and sweetest perfumes from the plants. This comparison suggests that the paradise created by the Elohim in the passage could be interpreted as the Garden of Eden.\nIts location in the area now known as Israel, not far from modern-day Turkey and Greece, would place it in the western part of the original supercontinent which is an interesting detail to take notice of. If we consider the general locations of Israel, Turkey, and Greece on today\u0026rsquo;s map and translate that to a single continent scenario, the Garden of Eden would likely be situated near the coast of this supercontinent, with access to the sea. This coastal location would provide a favorable environment for a lush and fertile paradise, with an abundance of natural resources, contributing to the idyllic setting described in the story.\nIll. 4 - Glowing dome structures in a lush landscape Good and Evil # Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die. Genesis 2: 16-17.\nThis means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.\nIn this passage, Yahweh quotes Genesis 2:16-17, where humans are allowed to eat from every tree in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, as eating from it would result in death. The passage then interprets this biblical warning as a metaphor, essentially saying that humans, as the created beings, can learn and read any available books, but they must not delve into scientific knowledge, or they will face severe consequences.\nExploring the idea that the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil represents access to scientific knowledge records or other types of knowledge storage allows us to reinterpret the biblical story from a different perspective.\nIn this interpretation, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil serves as a metaphor for the forbidden knowledge that the creators, or Elohim, want to keep hidden from humans. By restricting access to this knowledge, the creators aim to maintain control over humans and prevent them from reaching their full potential or surpassing their creators in terms of intellectual and technological advancements.\nThe warning about the consequences of eating from the tree could be understood as a cautionary measure to keep humans from venturing into the realms of science and technology that the creators deemed dangerous or threatening. The idea that humans would \u0026ldquo;surely die\u0026rdquo; if they consumed the fruit from the tree may symbolize the potential catastrophic consequences of humans gaining access to advanced scientific knowledge, which could lead to misuse, destruction, or imbalance within their world.\nThis perspective adds an intriguing layer to the story of the Garden of Eden, suggesting that the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is not just a moral or philosophical concept but a representation of the powerful and potentially dangerous nature of scientific knowledge. In this context, the story emphasizes the importance of responsible use of knowledge and the potential risks associated with unrestricted access to advanced information, as well as the desire of the creators to maintain control and balance within their creation.\nHypothesizing how an advanced civilization like the Elohim would preserve knowledge is an interesting aspect that may intrigue many of you. We can consider several possibilities that go beyond traditional methods, incorporating futuristic and cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Elohim may use advanced digital storage systems, possibly utilizing quantum computing, to store vast amounts of information. These storage systems would be highly efficient, compact, and capable of handling complex data structures, ensuring the preservation of their knowledge for extended periods. Another possibility is that the Elohim have developed advanced artificial intelligence systems that can store and process information. These AI systems could act as dynamic libraries, continuously updating and organizing the knowledge, making it easily accessible for the Elohim.\nThe Elohim might also harness biotechnology for preserving knowledge by encoding information into the DNA of living organisms or creating synthetic life forms specifically designed to store data. This method would allow them to access the stored knowledge by decoding the DNA sequences when needed. The Elohim could have developed advanced materials and technologies to store information at the atomic or molecular level, creating highly durable and long-lasting storage mediums. This approach would offer a high level of information density, ensuring the preservation of vast quantities of knowledge over extended periods.\nIll. 5 - Interior of a dome structure featuring round shaped and greenery Origins of science # He brought them to the man to see what he would name them. Genesis 2: 19.\nHuman beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them. Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 2:19, which describes how the first humans were given the responsibility to name the plants and animals around them. The passage explains that the creators, or Elohim, taught humans about the plants and animals in their environment, including their names and properties. This knowledge of botany and zoology was not considered dangerous for humans, so they were allowed to learn about these subjects. The passage also conveys the joy and excitement of the Elohim scientists as they observed the first human male and female eagerly learning from them.\nBotany and zoology are branches of biology that focus on the study of plant and animal life, respectively. These fields provide essential knowledge about the organisms that share the planet with humans, their life cycles, habitats, and interactions with their environment. The understanding of these subjects allows humans to better manage resources, protect ecosystems, and maintain a balanced relationship with nature.\nFrom the perspective of the Elohim, it is likely that botany and zoology were deemed safe for humans because these fields generally do not provide direct access to advanced technologies or dangerous scientific knowledge that could be misused or threaten the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s control over their creation. While botany and zoology offer valuable information about the living world, they do not inherently empower humans with the means to develop advanced technologies, manipulate genetic material, or create artificial life forms. By allowing humans to learn about botany and zoology, the Elohim would be fostering a sense of responsibility and appreciation for the natural world, which could help maintain a harmonious relationship between humans and their environment. This would be beneficial for both humans and the Elohim, as it would promote the sustainability and well-being of the planet.\nAs the creators shared knowledge about the plants and animals in their environment, including their names and properties, humans began to learn about the living world around them. This early education in botany and zoology would have laid the foundation for their understanding of biology, ecology, and other related scientific fields. So, within this context, botany and zoology can be considered the first terrestrial human sciences acquired by the first humans.\nIll. 6 - Transluscent platform above the clouds Sixth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"17","href":"/intro/age-of-cancer/","title":"Age of Cancer","description":"The Age of Cancer, spanning from 8,850 to 6,690 BC, follows the Age of Leo in the Wheel of Heaven narrative.

The passage then suggests that some scientists within the Elohim team felt a deep love for the humans they created and wanted to provide them with a complete education, including advanced scientific knowledge. These scientists, known collectively as the Serpent, encouraged the young humans, who were almost adults, to pursue their scientific studies, promising that by doing so, they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.\nIt appears that some scientists within the Elohim team developed a strong emotional bond with their human creations. This emotional connection may have led them to believe that the humans deserved to have access to the same knowledge as their creators, including advanced scientific understanding. As a result, these scientists challenged the restrictions imposed by their own civilization on the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans.\nBy encouraging the young humans to pursue scientific studies, these scientists were essentially advocating for their creations to achieve their full intellectual potential and become as knowledgeable as the Elohim themselves. This act of defiance against the established norms could be seen as a gesture of love, empathy, or solidarity with the human beings they had created.\nHowever, this act could also be seen as controversial or dangerous within the context of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s original intentions for humans, as providing access to advanced scientific knowledge could potentially lead to unforeseen consequences or challenges to the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s authority and control over their creation.\nAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. Genesis 3: 7.\nThe new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their “parents” for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 3:7, where the eyes of the first humans were opened, and they realized they were naked. The passage then suggests that this realization also made them aware of their potential to become creators themselves, which made them angry at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them away from scientific books.\nThe new human beings appear to have developed a sense of intellectual curiosity and a desire to gain knowledge and become creators themselves. This newfound awareness of their own potential may have led them to question the restrictions imposed on their access to scientific knowledge and to feel angry or resentful towards their creators for keeping them ignorant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible that this anger was also fueled by a sense of betrayal, as the humans may have felt that their creators were withholding important information that could have helped them understand their world and their place in it. This realization could have led to a fundamental shift in the relationship between humans and their creators, as the former began to question the latter\u0026rsquo;s authority and to assert their own intellectual autonomy.\nThe humans\u0026rsquo; anger at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them away from scientific books suggests that they viewed this restriction as a form of oppression or control. This interpretation is reinforced by the comparison to \u0026ldquo;dangerous laboratory animals,\u0026rdquo; which implies that the Elohim were treating the humans as mere subjects of experimentation, rather than as equals or partners in the creation process. This sense of frustration and resentment could have motivated the humans to seek out knowledge and power on their own, potentially leading to a rebellion or a shift in the power dynamics between humans and the Elohim. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that this rebellion could have taken the form of a quest for scientific knowledge or technological advancement, as the humans sought to catch up with or surpass their creators.\nAlternatively, the humans\u0026rsquo; anger could have turned inward, as they began to question their own place in the world and their purpose as creations. This could have led to a sense of alienation or despair, as the humans struggled to reconcile their newfound awareness with their previously limited understanding of their own existence. The realization of their own potential as creators could have had far-reaching consequences for the humans and their relationship with the Elohim, potentially setting the stage for a complex and fraught dynamic between these two groups.\nIll. 1 - Modern looking urban landscape in front of large pond The Serpent # And Yahweh1 Elohim said unto the serpent, ‘Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed\u0026hellip; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.’ Genesis 3: 14.\nThe “serpent” was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 3:14, where the serpent is cursed for tempting the humans to eat from the tree of knowledge. The passage then suggests that the serpent refers to a small group of creators who wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth. It appears that this group of creators challenged the established norms of their own civilization by advocating for the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans. This act of defiance may have been seen as a threat to the government\u0026rsquo;s control over its population and to the established order of their society.\nAs a result, the creators were punished by being sent into exile on Earth, while the other scientists were forced to abandon their experiments and leave the planet. This punishment suggests that the government of the Elohim was willing to use harsh measures to maintain control over its population and to prevent the dissemination of dangerous knowledge. This passage therefore suggests that the conflict between the creators who wished to share knowledge with humans and the government that sought to maintain control over its population had significant consequences, leading to the exile of the creators and a shift in the relationship between humans and their creators.\nThe fact that the Elohimian scientists were banished by their remote home planet government is presented as a crucial consequence of the narrative. The creators who wished to share knowledge with humans represent a progressive or revolutionary element within the Elohimian society, challenging the established order and advocating for greater freedom and equality. The government of the Elohim, on the other hand, represents a conservative or authoritarian element, seeking to maintain control and preserve the existing power structure. The conflict between these two groups could be seen as a reflection of the tensions that can arise between progressive and conservative elements within any society.\nUnto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them. Genesis 3: 21.\nThe creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, enough to manage without needing any further contact with them. The Bible has preserved a sentence, which is close to the original document:\nBehold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil2: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. Genesis 3: 22.\nHuman life is very short, but there is a scientific way to prolong it. Human scientists who study all their lives can only begin to amass sufficient knowledge to start making interesting discoveries when they get old, which is the reason why human progress is so slow. If humans could live ten times longer, scientific knowledge would take a gigantic leap forward.\nThis passage describes how the creators of humanity provided Adam and Eve with clothing made from animal skins, giving them the basic means of survival necessary to manage without further contact. The passage also suggests that humans have the potential to gain knowledge of good and evil, similar to their creators. This implies that humans have the capacity for growth and development, potentially reaching the same level of knowledge as their creators.\nAccording to the passage, the scientific way to prolong human life would enable humans to make significant strides in knowledge and discovery, potentially leading to a \u0026ldquo;gigantic leap forward.\u0026rdquo; If humans could live ten times longer, for example, they would have much more time to study and accumulate knowledge, allowing them to make discoveries that may currently be out of reach due to the limitations of the human lifespan. They would also have more time to gain practical experience and apply their knowledge to real-world problems, potentially leading to more rapid progress and innovation. Furthermore, a longer lifespan would allow for greater collaboration and knowledge-sharing among generations, as older scientists and thinkers would have more time to pass on their knowledge and mentor younger generations. This could lead to a more cumulative and expansive body of knowledge, potentially unlocking new insights and discoveries.\nIf when they were first created these new beings could have lived much longer, they would have quite rapidly become our equals because their mental faculties are slightly superior to our own. They are unaware of their full potential. This applies especially to the people of Israel who, as I mentioned earlier, had been selected in a contest as the most successful type of humanoid on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. This explains why they have always considered themselves to be the “chosen people”. In truth they were the people chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. You can see for yourself the number of geniuses born out of that race.\nHere, Yahweh explains that if humans had a longer lifespan, they would be able to rapidly develop their mental faculties and potentially become equals to their creators, as they possess slightly superior mental capabilities. He also mentions that the people of Israel were selected as the most successful humanoid type on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. The idea is presented that the people of Israel were chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. The passage suggests that the people of Israel have historically considered themselves to be the \u0026ldquo;chosen people\u0026rdquo; due to their intelligence and superior mental faculties. This idea is supported by the numerous geniuses that have emerged from the Jewish community throughout history.\nThe idea that the people of Israel were selected as the most successful humanoid type due to their superior intelligence can be understood as a way to explain why this particular group of people has historically played such a prominent role in human history. According to this perspective, the Jewish people\u0026rsquo;s intellectual abilities and creativity have made them uniquely suited to excel in various fields, including science, philosophy, literature, and the arts. This has allowed them to make significant contributions to human civilization, and to achieve a level of success and influence that is disproportionate to their relatively small numbers.\nOne example of the Jewish people\u0026rsquo;s intellectual contributions to human civilization can be seen in the field of science. Despite their relatively small population, Jews have made significant contributions to many branches of science, including physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Some of the most famous scientists in history were Jewish, including Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Robert Oppenheimer. In addition to science, Jewish thinkers and writers have also played an important role in shaping human thought and culture. The Hebrew Bible, for example, has been tremendously influential in the development of Western civilization, and has inspired countless works of literature, art, and music. Jewish philosophers such as Maimonides and Spinoza have also had a significant impact on human thought, and continue to be studied and debated to this day.\nIll. 2 - Antidiluvian queen on golden throne Safeguarding the secrets # So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. Genesis 3: 24.\nSoldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators’ residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge.\nYahweh states that after the humans ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they were banished from the Garden of Eden and prevented from accessing the Tree of Life. The entrance to the creators\u0026rsquo; residence was guarded by soldiers with advanced weaponry to keep human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge.\nIt is suggested that the Elohim created human beings to be like them, but were concerned about the potential dangers of giving them access to their advanced scientific knowledge and the ability to extend life span (Tree of Life). The Elohim may have seen themselves as responsible stewards of this knowledge and wanted to ensure that it was not used irresponsibly or for destructive purposes. The Elohim who were banished to Earth after being condemned by their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government for wanting to give their human creations access to scientific knowledge were terrestrial keepers of that knowledge. This may have made them even more cautious about protecting their knowledge and keeping it from their human creations. The soldiers with advanced weaponry guarding the entrance to their residence can be seen as a measures of the Elohim government\u0026rsquo;s determination to protect their knowledge at all costs.\nIll. 3 - Defense equipment in front of silos Chimera # And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. Genesis 4: 3-4.\nThe creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the “tree of life”, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn this passage, Cain brings an offering of fruit to Yahweh, while Abel brings the firstlings of his flock and their fat. The passage suggests that the creators in exile, who were under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their superiors that the newly created people were good and would not turn against their creators. Through this, they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of the first human beings to benefit from the “tree of life,” allowing them to live for an exceptionally long time, as stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn this context, the Tree of Life can be seen as a sign of devotion because the creators in exile were willing to risk their own safety and well-being to provide their human creations with access to this technology. They believed that their human creations deserved to have the same opportunity to live long and productive lives as they did, and were willing to go to great lengths to ensure that this was made possible. By providing the humans with access to the Tree of Life, the creators were showing their commitment to their creations and their desire to see them thrive.\nThe fact that the creators had to convince their superiors to allow the humans to benefit from the Tree of Life suggests that this was not an easy decision to make. The Elohim government may have been concerned about the potential risks and dangers of allowing humans to live longer, and may have been hesitant to grant permission for this technology to be shared. By convincing their superiors to allow the humans to benefit from the Tree of Life, the creators were demonstrating their commitment to their creations and their belief in their potential to use this technology responsibly. This act of devotion and advocacy on behalf of their human creations can be seen as a significant gesture of love and solidarity.\nIt is safe to assume that the relationship between the banished Elohim and their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government was strained, if not outright hostile. The banishment of the Elohim from their home planet suggests that they were seen as a threat to the established order, possibly due to their advocacy for greater freedom and equality and their willingness to challenge the established norms regarding the dissemination of scientific knowledge. The government\u0026rsquo;s decision to punish the creators by banishing them to Earth and forcing the other scientists to abandon their experiments suggests a willingness to use harsh measures to maintain control over its population and prevent the spread of dangerous knowledge.\nIt is within the reasonable to assume further that the banished Elohim maintained some form of communication with their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government, perhaps in an attempt to reconcile their differences or negotiate a return to their previous status. However, the text does not provide any details regarding the nature of this communication, so it is difficult to say for certain what the relationship between the two parties looked like. It is also possible that the banished Elohim took measures to protect themselves and their knowledge from their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government, perhaps by developing new technologies or forming alliances with other groups who shared their views. Again, the text does not provide any specific details regarding these actions, so it is difficult to say for certain what the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s strategy may have been.\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. Genesis 6: 1-2.\nThe creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.\nYahweh refers to Genesis 6:1-2, which describes how the sons of Elohim took wives from among the daughters of men. According to the passage\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, the creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives. This suggests that the creators may have established relationships with humans, potentially forming families and intermingling with the human population.\nThis passage raises questions about the nature of the relationship between the banished Elohim and their human creations. It is possible that the creators saw themselves as benevolent benefactors or mentors to the humans, and sought to establish relationships with them in order to guide and protect them. Alternatively, the Elohim may have been motivated by a desire for companionship or a sense of loneliness, leading them to seek out human partners. It is also possible that the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s relationships with humans were more complex or fraught, potentially leading to tensions or conflicts between the two groups. The fact that the Elohim were banished by their own government suggests that there may have been significant disagreements or power struggles within Elohimian society, which could have influenced the nature of their relationship with humans.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make a small paranthesis here: The story in the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish religious text, is often seen as a parallel to the passage in Genesis 6:1-2. According to the Book of Enoch, the \u0026ldquo;sons of God\u0026rdquo;, clearly referring to the Elohim as a whole1, saw the beauty of human women and took them as wives, giving birth to a race of giants known as the Nephilim.\nThe parallels between the story in the Book of Enoch and the passage in Genesis 6:1-2 are striking, as both describe a situation in which supernatural beings take human women as wives and give birth to a new hybrid race of beings. In the Book of Enoch, the \u0026ldquo;sons of God\u0026rdquo; are explicitly identified as fallen beings, whereas in Genesis they are simply referred to as \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim,\u0026rdquo; a term which can be interpreted in various ways. The Enochian account is more precise in the sense that it tells us that there\u0026rsquo;s a specific subset of the Elohimian species that were having children of the Human species. The classifier used is \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo;2 which refers to the banished Elohim on planet Earth, clearly delimiting them from the remainder of the Elohimian civilization.\nIll. 4 - Group of individuals standing on golden floor Exceptional children # My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. Genesis 6: 3.\nLongevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the “tree of life”. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind’s progress was slowed down.\nIn this passage, Yahweh states that his spirit will not always strive with man because they are flesh and limited in their lifespan. He declares that their days shall be limited to 120 years. It is suggested that longevity is not hereditary and that the children of the newly created human beings did not automatically benefit from the \u0026ldquo;Tree of Life\u0026rdquo;. As a result, the secret of life was lost, and humanity\u0026rsquo;s progress was slowed down. This passage implies that the limitation of human lifespan had a significant impact on the development of human civilization, as it prevented humans from accumulating knowledge and experience over longer periods of time.\nThe Elohim home planet\u0026rsquo;s government may have been relieved because the loss of the secret of life meant that their creations, the humans, would not have the ability to challenge their authority or disrupt the established order of their society. The government of the Elohim may have seen the sharing of scientific knowledge and the ability to prolong life as potentially destabilizing factors, and the fact that these abilities were not hereditary may have provided some reassurance that they could maintain control over their creations.\nThe loss of the secret of life may have slowed down human progress, which may have been seen as a positive development by the government of the Elohim. As mentioned in the previous passage, the creators who wished to share knowledge with humans were seen as a progressive or revolutionary element within the Elohimian society, challenging the established order and advocating for greater freedom and equality. The government of the Elohim, on the other hand, represented a conservative or authoritarian element, seeking to maintain control and preserve the existing power structure. The loss of the secret of life may have been seen as a way to maintain the status quo and prevent any disruptive changes to the established order of their society.\nWhen the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. Genesis 6: 4.\nThere you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.\nThe passage describes how the offspring of the sons of Elohim (the creators living in exile) and the daughters of men became mighty men of renown. This suggests that the offspring of these unions possessed exceptional abilities and may have played an important role in human history. However, the actions of the Elohim in producing these offspring were seen as dangerous by the authorities on their distant planet, and as a result, they decided to destroy what had been created. The passage implies that the scientific progress on Earth was seen as a threat to the established order of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s society and that they were willing to take drastic measures to maintain control over their population. It is possible that the authorities saw the interbreeding between the Elohim and humans as a violation of some fundamental principle, or as a threat to the genetic purity of their civilization.\nThe drastic measures taken by the authorities to destroy what had been created suggests that they viewed the situation as a serious threat. It is possible that they believed that the interbreeding between the Elohim and humans would lead to some kind of catastrophic event or disruption of the natural order. Alternatively, they may have been concerned about the potential for the exceptional abilities of the offspring to upset the existing power structures on their home planet. Whatever the specific concerns may have been, the fact that the authorities took such drastic measures suggests that they viewed the situation as a major threat that required urgent action.\nDuring the second encounter with Yahweh, witnessed in the the second book \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh makes a revelation that refers back to the children made during these prediluvian times.\nThere is an important revelation, which you may now make. The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a specific destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of “the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men”, as mentioned in Genesis. Their original mistake was to have mated with their scientific creations.\nYahweh reveals that the Jews are direct descendants of the Elohim who mated with their scientific creations, the daughters of men, as mentioned in Genesis. The Jews, therefore, have a specific destiny reserved for them because of their direct lineage to the Elohim. This revelation suggests that the relationship between the Elohim and their human creations was complex and intertwined, with significant consequences for human history and the fate of the Jewish people.\nIll. 5 - Landmark structure emitting bright beam into the sky Seventh day of creation # As per the sidereal astrology, The World Age refers to the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes, also known as the Great Year. Each age lasts approximately 2,160 years, during which the vernal equinox moves through one of the twelve zodiacal constellations.\nThe Age of Cancer is said to have started around –8,850 and ended around –6,690 BCE. This period is believed to have been characterized by the emergence of agriculture and the domestication of animals. It was a time of significant technological progress, particularly in the development of tools and weapons made from copper and bronze.\nIf we consider the Seventh day of creation as the day of rest, it is typically associated with a time of peace and harmony, when all creation is in a state of balance and order. In the context of the Elohim story, this could be interpreted as a time when the creators had successfully established a stable and harmonious society on their home planet, marked by advanced scientific knowledge and a deep understanding of the natural world.\nDuring this age, the Elohim may have focused on cultivating their knowledge and developing new technologies, as well as exploring the mysteries of the universe. They may have also devoted time to the arts, music, and other creative pursuits, as a means of expressing their understanding of the world and their place within it.\nIt is also possible that the Seventh day of creation represents a time of reflection and introspection, when the creators took a step back to consider the impact of their actions and the consequences of their knowledge. They may have recognized the potential dangers of sharing their knowledge too freely or using it for destructive purposes, and may have taken steps to ensure that their discoveries were used responsibly and for the greater good.\nA quick recap # The phrase \u0026ldquo;Sons of Man\u0026rdquo; is a metaphorical or figurative expression. The word \u0026ldquo;of Man\u0026rdquo; refers to humanity as a whole, and \u0026ldquo;sons\u0026rdquo; emphasizes the shared human experience and identity. In contemporary usage, the phrase \u0026ldquo;Sons of Man\u0026rdquo; is not commonly used in everyday language. Instead, people tend to use terms such as \u0026ldquo;humanity,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;humankind.\u0026rdquo; In the same vein, the \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; refers to the entirety of the God-kind. If we use the original Hebrew term Elohim instead of God, we would refer the entirety of the Elohim-kind in these archaic terms as the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe original Hebrew term is Nephilim, a term borrowed from Hebrew נְפִילִים (“nefilim, fallen ones”), plural of נָפִיל (“nafíl, fallen one”).

During this time, the Elohim faction exiled to Earth, including the group known as the Serpent, held a belief in sharing scientific knowledge with humanity, contrasting with the controlling approach of the Elohim government from their home planet. This age also includes the dramatic event where the Elohim government, feeling threatened by human scientific advancement, decides to destroy all life on Earth with nuclear missiles.

The number eight is encoded in the amount of people entering Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark: Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives, a total of 8 people.\nThe Age of Gemini is associated with the eighth day of creation and represents a time of new beginnings and fresh starts. This is reflected in the story of Noah and the Flood, which is said to have taken place during this age. According to the biblical account, God was disappointed with the state of humanity and decided to cleanse the Earth with a flood, sparing only Noah and his family. The Age of Gemini is also associated with the concept of duality, reflected in the symbol of the twins. This age is said to represent a time of increased communication, exchange, and cooperation between different cultures and peoples. It is a time when ideas and knowledge are shared and disseminated, leading to increased understanding and collaboration.\nThe Decision # And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Genesis 6: 5.\nThe “evil” in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being “good”, as far as those on the Elohim’s planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their “evil” was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.\nWhat happened on Earth was deemed too dangerous to the authorities on the Elohimian home planet. The passage suggests that Elohim saw the wickedness of humans on Earth, as they desired to become scientific and independent, equal to their creators. This desire for progress and advancement was seen as \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; by the authorities on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, who preferred the new human beings to remain primitive and under their control. The conflict between the desire for progress and the desire for control can be seen as a fundamental tension that has played out throughout human history.\nAccording to the perspective presented in the text, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet government held a certain moral code that defined what was \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; From their point of view, the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; outcome was for the newly created human beings to remain primitive and dependent on their creators, while the \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; outcome was for humans to become independent and equal to their creators through scientific progress.\nThis suggests that the morality of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government was based on a hierarchical power structure, with the creators at the top and the humans below them. In this framework, it was considered \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; for the humans to remain subservient to their creators, while it was \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; for them to challenge their creators\u0026rsquo; power or to strive for equality with them. This moral code may have been enforced through the government\u0026rsquo;s control over scientific knowledge, as well as through the use of force to maintain the existing power structure.\nWhat is important to understand here is that the concept of good and evil presented in this interpretation of Genesis is tied to a specific perspective, that of the Elohim home planet\u0026rsquo;s government. The Elohim saw themselves as responsible stewards of scientific knowledge, and believed that sharing this knowledge with humans would be dangerous and could lead to destruction. From their perspective, it was \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; for humans to remain primitive and subservient to their creators, as this would ensure their safety and prevent them from acquiring dangerous knowledge.\nHowever, this perspective is not absolute and is subject to interpretation. Other individuals or societies may have different beliefs about what is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and what is \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; For example, a society that values progress and innovation may see the acquisition of scientific knowledge as \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and the restriction of knowledge as \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, a society that values individual freedom may see the subjugation of one group by another as \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; and the pursuit of equality as \u0026ldquo;good.\u0026rdquo;\nIt can be inferred that the Elohim faction banished to Earth, including the group known as the Serpent, had a different moral code than the Elohim government from their home planet. They believed in sharing scientific knowledge with humanity and allowing them to progress and evolve, while the Elohim government sought to maintain control over their population and prevent the dissemination of dangerous knowledge. The group known as the Serpent, in particular, was portrayed as a small group of creators who challenged the established norms of their own civilization by advocating for the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans. This act of defiance may have been seen as a threat to the government\u0026rsquo;s control over its population and to the established order of their society. As a result, they were punished by being sent into exile on Earth, while the other scientists were forced to abandon their experiments and leave the planet.\nThis suggests that the Serpent and the banished Elohim faction had a moral code that placed a high value on the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of civilization, even if it meant challenging the established order and risking their own well-being. They believed in the potential of humanity to reach their level of knowledge and saw themselves as mentors and guides to help them achieve this goal. This is in contrast to the moral code of the Elohim government, which placed a high value on maintaining control over their population and preventing the dissemination of dangerous knowledge.\nIll. 1 - Circular megalopolis seen from the sky The Preservation Project # The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.\nThis was true figuratively speaking, but in reality - and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this - a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nThe Elohim government, seeing the scientific progress of human beings as a threat, decided to destroy all life on Earth using nuclear missiles. However, the exiled creators asked Noah to build a spaceship that would preserve pairs of each species during the cataclysm. The preservation of a single living cell of each species, male and female, was sufficient to recreate the whole being, which was a colossal task but completed on time. Noah\u0026amp;rsquo;s Ark is therefore a space vessel capable of leaving the waters and going up to the orbit rather than a mere watercraft floating on the potentially cataclysmic oceans.\nThe overarching story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark as presented in the Bible can actually be understood as a metaphor for the larger scientific undertaking: The Elohim, who had created humans and other species on Earth, realized that a catastrophic event was imminent and that all life on Earth was at risk. To preserve the genetic material of each species, they instructed Noah to build a spaceship that would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm, containing a single living cell of each species, male and female.\nThe text suggests that this was not meant to be taken literally, but rather figuratively. The idea is that a single living cell contains all the genetic information necessary to recreate an entire being, similar to how the first living cell of a fetus contains all the information needed to create a human being. In this way, Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark can be seen as a metaphor for a larger project to preserve the genetic material of all species on Earth, which was accomplished by collecting and storing living cells from each species. This insight presents Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark not as a miraculous vessel that saved a select group of animals from a global flood, but rather as a symbol of humanity\u0026rsquo;s efforts to preserve the genetic diversity of life on Earth.\nThe preservation project would have involved collecting a single living cell of each species, male and female, and preserving them on board the spaceship. The process of preserving the genetic material would likely have involved advanced technology and techniques that are beyond our current understanding.\nOne possibility is that the genetic material was cryogenically preserved, which involves freezing the material at very low temperatures to slow down its metabolic processes and prevent decay. Another possibility is that the genetic material was stored in a highly stable and protected environment, such as within a specially designed container or within the structure of the spaceship itself. It is important to note that the details of how the preservation project was actually carried out are not provided in the passage, so any explanations would be speculative. However, the passage suggests that the exiled creators had all the necessary knowledge and technology that enabled them to undertake this monumental task.\nIll. 2 - Guarding groups collecting genetic material all over the world The spacecraft had three sections:\n\u0026hellip;and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. Genesis 6: 16.\nThis passage clearly reiterates that the ark was indeed a spacecraft, and needed to be constructed in a predefined manner based on blueprints provided by the banished Elohim, with the instruction to make it with three sections or floors: a lower section, a second section, and a third section. This is consistent with the idea that the ark was not just a wooden boat, but a technologically advanced spacecraft designed to preserve genetic material and sustain life during a catastrophic event.\nIll. 1 - Guarding groups collecting genetic material all over the world The Great Flood # When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe Great Flood caused by the nuclear explosion submerged the continent with a massive tidal wave and destroyed all life forms on the surface. However, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth in Noah\u0026rsquo;s spacecraft. Everything was preserved and guarded in time through the Ark spacecraft carrying genetic material of each species. This ensured the continuation of life on Earth after the fading away of the cataclysmic flood and its aftermath\u0026rsquo;s effects.\nThe Great Flood was a cataclysmic event that caused a global mass extinction and was responsible for breaking up the original supercontinent. The explosion that triggered the Great Flood was so powerful that it might have caused a shift in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis, which in turn resulted in the sinking of the ancient continent. This theory is supported by geological evidence that suggests that there was a major shift in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s tectonic plates around 8'000 years ago, which is consistent with the timeline proposed in the book. The Flood was also responsible for depositing large amounts of sedimentary rock and other geological formations that can still be observed today. Overall, the theory suggests that the Great Flood was a catastrophic event that fundamentally altered the course of human history and the planet itself.\nAs the floodwaters receded, they left behind massive sedimentary deposits, which only over a few months or years, turned into solid rock formations. The shifting of tectonic plates, caused by the catastrophic event, also resulted in the creation of mountain ranges and the breakup of the original supercontinent, Pangaea. The movement of the plates and the resulting collisions caused intense pressure and wolding of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust, leading to the formation of mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, the Andes or even the Alps. The layers of sedimentary rock formations that were deposited during the Great Flood can also be seen as evidence of the event. The distinct layers represent different periods of time, and the fossils found within them provide clues about the types of creatures that existed during each period.\nIll. 3 - Cosmic impact causing Earth-wide cataclysmic mass-extinction event The ark\u0026hellip; was lift up above the earth. Genesis 7: 17.\nAs you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted “above” the Earth and not “on” the water.\nThe passage highlights that the ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water, as mentioned in Genesis 7:17. The preservational spacecraft managed to escape in time. The description of the ark (spacecraft) being lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth strongly suggests that it was not a conventional boat as conventional interpretations still persist to explain, but rather a spacecraft that has to be capable of leaving the waters into the space of air.\nIt is noteworthy, that there are reasons to believe that the Great Flood happened around 6'000 BC when the Sun was rising in the house of Gemini during the vernal equinox, aligning with Castor, one of the majors star (which actually consists of multiple stars) of the constellation.\nIll. 4 - Ark spacecraft in safe orbital space Reseeding # Then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:\nAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. Genesis 7: 24.\nThis passage states that after the flood, the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days, implying that it took that long for the radioactive fallout to dissipate and the environment to become safe for the Ark\u0026rsquo;s passengers to disembark.\nWhen the decision was made to destroy all life on Earth, they sent nuclear missiles to achieve the goal of mass-extinction as pointed out at the outset of this chapter. The resulting explosions would have created radioactive fallout, which would have been dangerous to any remaining life on the planet, including the preserved genetic material on the spacecraft. Therefore, it was necessary to wait until the radioactive fallout had dissipated before landing on the ground and beginning the process of reseeding the planet with life.\nSome method of nuclear decontamination was necessary to shorten the amount of time they had to wait in safer outer space before attempting to land back on the grounds of Earth.\nLater it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.\nAnd Elohim remembered Noah\u0026hellip; and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged. Genesis 8: 1.\nThe passage describes how after the flood, the Ark spacecraft carrying Noah and the genetic legacy of all life created on Earth by the Elohim on Earth landed on on dry land.\nAfter monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:\nAnd Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. Genesis 8: 20.\nAfter the Great Flood, the banished creators who had saved the human race from destruction, instructed Noah to release the first batch of resurrected animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere, which turned out to be a successful experiment. The recreation of all animals and human beings followed. The human survivors were then asked to show gratitude to their creators by working and multiplying. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and cattle to the creators. He built an altar and offered burnt offerings of every clean beast and fowl to Yahweh as a sign of their gratitude. Humans were thankful.\nThe goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.\nAnd by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. Genesis 10: 32.\nthe purpose of humanity is to achieve scientific progress, and after the Flood, the human races were returned to their original places of creation. The preservation of genetic material in the Ark made it possible to recreate all species of animals that had been destroyed during the Flood. After the Flood, the human population and animal kingdom were thus able to start anew and repopulate the Earth. The passage from Genesis 10:32 suggests that the descendants of Noah\u0026rsquo;s three sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth) were responsible for repopulating a specific part of the Earth in today\u0026rsquo;s Fertile Crescent and therefore creating the various nations at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. This can be seen as a symbol of the importance of diversity in human society, with different races and cultures contributing to the overall progress and development of humanity.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of time it would have taken to recreate each species from the genetic data preserved aboard the Ark spacecraft. However, it is clear that this would have been a massive undertaking, requiring advanced scientific knowledge and technology. The text suggests that the Elohim creators were able to successfully recreate each animal species preserved that way. It is noteworthy that some species were deliberately chosen not to be recreated at this moment in time. A prominent example here are the dinosaurs.\nNoahic covenant # The creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n\u0026hellip;for the imagination of man’s heart is evil. Genesis 8: 21.\nThe creators were pleased to see that the humans had expressed gratitude for their preservation and promised not to try to destroy their creation again. They realized that it was natural for humans to desire scientific progress. Despite this, they acknowledged that the human heart can be prone to evil, as stated in Genesis 8:21. The preservation of life was seen as a positive outcome. Having safeguarded life was good in the eyes of the banished creators.\nThe covenant established with Noah in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noahic covenant, in which God promises never again to wipe out all life on Earth through a flood and designates the rainbow as a symbol of the \u0026ldquo;eternal covenant,\u0026rdquo; can be seen as a precursor to the Noahide Laws. The covenant established with Noah [Gen 9:1-17] extends to every living being, including humans and other creatures. As part of this agreement, the creators pledges never again to wipe out all life on Earth through a flood, and designates the rainbow as a symbol of the \u0026ldquo;eternal covenant\u0026rdquo; between the Elohim and every living creature, both human and animal, on the planet.\nThe Seven Laws refer to the set of moral and religious laws that according to Jewish tradition, were given to all of humanity through Noah after the flood. These laws are also known as the Noahide Laws or the Seven Noahide Laws. According to Jewish tradition, these laws are applicable to all human beings, regardless of their religion or nationality, and are considered the foundation of a just and moral society.\nThe Tower of Babel # But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators’ planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket - The Tower of Babel.\nAnd now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Genesis 11: 6.\nThe people of Israel, who were considered the most intelligent race, made remarkable progress and with the help of the exiled creators, were able to conquer space. The creators wanted the new human beings to go to their planet to obtain their forgiveness by demonstrating that they were intelligent, scientific, grateful, and peaceful. They built an enormous rocket, known as the Tower of Babel, which reflected their aspirations to achieve great feats beyond their current capabilities.\nIt is possible that it could have been built in Eridu or a nearby location close to the Persian Gulf. This would have provided easy access to a large body of water that could have been used for rocket launch and recovery operations. Additionally, being near a body of water could have provided a source of fuel or other resources needed for the rocket\u0026rsquo;s construction and operation.\nThe people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this. They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.\nGo to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. Genesis 11: 7-8.\nThe people on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet became alarmed when they heard about the Tower of Babel, a rocket built by the people of Israel with the help of the exiled creators. They feared that the new human beings may be able to reach their planet and asked Yahweh to intervene. Yahweh then caused confusion by confounding their language, leading to their scattering across the Earth. This event is described in Genesis 11:7-8.\nthe people on the distant planet who were observing the Earth became frightened when they heard that the people of Israel were making remarkable progress in space exploration and were building an enormous rocket to go to the creators\u0026rsquo; planet to obtain their pardon. To prevent this from happening, they decided to intervene and confound the language of the people building the tower so that they would not understand each other\u0026rsquo;s speech.\nSo they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.\nPreventive action\nWar in Heaven # To avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nIn that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. Isaiah 27: 1.\nThe creators built their bases on high mountains and at the bottom of the sea to avoid being disturbed by humans. The mountain stations were gradually abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The banished creators had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nThe idea of a War in Heaven or a cosmic conflict between older and younger gods is a common theme in various mythologies and religious traditions. In the context of the Elohim and the banished creators, it is suggested that there was a power struggle or conflict between the original creators and a new faction that emerged on the home planet.\nThis conflict led to the banishment of the creators to Earth, where they were able to establish a presence and influence human history. The reference to \u0026ldquo;leviathan\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the dragon in the sea\u0026rdquo; in Isaiah 27:1 can be seen as symbolic of this conflict between the older and younger factions, with the \u0026ldquo;dragon\u0026rdquo; representing the banished creators who took refuge in the oceans.\nOverall, this suggests that the Elohim and the banished creators had different agendas and approaches to their interactions with humanity and the universe, leading to conflict and tension between them.\nAt that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.\nThis is a small but crucial sentence in the Raëlian canon, not to be mentioned again. The infamous myths about a pantheon of younger Gods fighting another pantheon of older Gods fully comes to fruition here, the so called \u0026ldquo;Theomachy\u0026rdquo;. The government of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet wanted to destroy the banished creators who had come to Earth and created humans. This indicates a conflict or disagreement between the two groups, possibly due to differing ideologies, beliefs, or goals. It also suggests that the creators may have been seen as a threat to the established order or power structure on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, leading to a desire to eliminate them.\nA quick recap # "},{"id":"19","href":"/intro/age-of-taurus/","title":"Age of Taurus","description":"The Age of Taurus, from 4,530 to 2,370 BC, is a significant period in the Wheel of Heaven narrative, following the Age of Gemini. In this age, the previously exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their home planet. They advocated for the humans on Earth, drawing the attention of their home planet to Earth and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, some humans, harboring a desire for vengeance, gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah. These humans, who had previously salvaged scientific secrets, prepared to retaliate against those who attempted to destroy them. This era culminated in the destruction of these towns by what is interpreted as a divine atomic explosion, as described in the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah​​​​​​​​.","content":"The Age of Taurus lasts from –4'530 to –2'370 and follows the Age of Gemini which lasted up to –4'530.\nPeace in Heaven # The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.\nThe exiled creators were eventually forgiven and permitted to return to their original planet. They used this opportunity to advocate on behalf of their creation, the humans on Earth. This led to the distant planet focusing their attention on Earth as they realized it was home to the people they had created.\nAccording to the text, the home planet\u0026rsquo;s government ultimately won the conflict and decided to pardon the exiled creators. The text does not provide specific details on how this conflict was resolved, but it suggests that the creators were able to plead their case and convince the government of their planet to forgive them. After the pardon, the creators were allowed to return to their original planet, and everyone on the distant planet became interested in Earth because it was inhabited by beings that they themselves had created. It is possible that the resolution of the conflict involved a negotiation or agreement between the two factions, but the text does not provide further details.\nSodom and Gomorrah # But among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them.\nThe passage talks about how a group of humans, the ones that were scattered all over during the construction of the interstellar spacecraft remembered in the Bible as the Tower of Babel, who nursed a desire for vengeance gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities which were located in the Jordan River plain, precisely where now the Dead Sea is located, in the biblical region of Canaan. They had salvaged a few scientific secrets and prepared an expedition to punish those who had tried to destroy them. This suggests that while the conflict between the creators and the home planet\u0026rsquo;s government had been resolved, there were still humans on Earth who held grudges and had access to advanced scientific knowledge.\nConsequently, the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on:\nAnd there came two angels to Sodom at even 3. Genesis 19: 1.\nThe creators sent two angels as spies to investigate what was happening in Sodom. This is mentioned in Genesis 19:1. The creators\u0026rsquo; authority from the distant planet of the Elohim used espionage as a means of gathering intelligence on the actions of humans on Earth. In this particular case, the creators sent two spies in the form of angels to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah. The use of spies suggests that the creators were monitoring and keeping tabs on human activities, possibly to ensure that humans were not attempting to create any technological advances that could pose a threat to their authority.\nIll. 1 - Red-colored cityscape Some humans tried to kill them, but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon:\nAnd they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great. Genesis 19: 11.\nThe two spies sent by the creators to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah were attacked by some humans who tried to kill them. However, the spies were able to defend themselves by using a pocket atomic weapon that blinded their attackers, both small and great. This event is described in the book of Genesis 19:11.\nThe passage describes how the two spies sent by the creators to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah were attacked by some of the humans there. In order to defend themselves, the spies used a pocket atomic weapon to blind their attackers. The phrase \u0026ldquo;smote the men\u0026rdquo; means that they struck or hit them with the weapon, causing them to become blind. The passage highlights the use of advanced technology by the creators, who were able to equip their agents with powerful weapons to protect themselves and carry out their mission.\nThey warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:\nUp, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city. Genesis 19: 14\nAs the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.\nEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. Genesis 19: 17.\nIn this passage, the two spies who were sent to investigate Sodom and Gomorrah warned the peaceful inhabitants to leave the city because it was going to be destroyed with an atomic explosion. The inhabitants did not fully grasp the severity of the situation and did not leave the city with a sense of urgency. The spies had to urge them to escape for their lives and not to look back. The plan was to annihilate the two cities of the Jordan plain.\nThe passage describes the warning given by the two spies to those who were peaceful in Sodom and Gomorrah to leave the town, as it was going to be destroyed by an atomic explosion. The warning was heeded, but the people were not in a hurry to leave as they did not understand the full danger of an atomic explosion. The spies urged them to escape for their lives, not to look behind them, and not to stay in the plain. This passage suggests that the creators had access to advanced technology and weaponry, including atomic weapons, similar to those employed to cause the Great Flood but evidently less potent in their strength, and were willing to use them to protect themselves or achieve their objectives.\nAnd the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:\nThen Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. Genesis 19: 24-26.\nAs you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.\nThe passage describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah through a rain of brimstone and fire from heaven. This destruction caused the death of all inhabitants and vegetation in the area. However, Lot\u0026rsquo;s wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt, which is suggested to be a result of the burns caused by the atomic explosion that killed those who were too close to the impact. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were both annihilated. The usage of the phrase \u0026ldquo;the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and brimstone from the sky\u0026rdquo; strongly suggests in archaic language of the Bible that that an atomic explosion is being described.\nIll. 2 - Tactical explosion over the sea Abraham # Now that Sodom and Gomorrah were both razed to the ground and most likely left the a huge crater that became known as the Dead Sea, Abraham, the infamous Hebrew patriarch of Biblical fame, does get introduced.\nLater, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them.\nThe creators, after the destruction of many leading intellectuals, observed that the people of Israel had relapsed into a semi-primitive state. They wanted to test if the people, and their leader in particular, still had positive feelings towards them.\nThis is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.\nLay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. Genesis 22: 12.\nThe passage describes a test conducted by the creators to see if Abraham\u0026rsquo;s feelings towards them were strong enough. It is mentioned that Abraham was willing to sacrifice his own son as part of this test, but the creators intervened and stopped him from doing so. The creators were satisfied with the outcome of the experiment and acknowledged that Abraham had strong feelings towards them.\nThis test was intended to see if Abraham still had positive feelings towards the creators, even after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and to test his loyalty and faith in their commandments. The creators were pleased with Abraham\u0026rsquo;s response, and the passage indicates that he passed the test and showed his reverence and fear towards them.\nIll. 2 - Individual standing on open-air plaza Regression # Because of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:\nPut away the foreign gods that are among you. Genesis 35: 2.\nThe passage suggests that after the destruction of advanced centers of civilization, such as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the elimination of intellectuals, human society regressed to a primitive state. The people began worshipping inanimate objects, such as pieces of stone and idols, instead of the actual creators. The quote, \u0026ldquo;Put away the foreign gods that are among you,\u0026rdquo; implies a call to abandon these idolatrous practices and return to the worship of the true creators.\nThe Elohim were seen as the creators of humanity and responsible for the progress and knowledge that early civilizations had achieved. The practice of idolatry, or the worship of physical objects or idols as deities, can be seen as a result of a loss of understanding and knowledge of the true nature of the Elohim. In the absence of the creators or their direct guidance, humans may have sought to fill the void with physical representations of their belief systems. Therefore, the admonition to \u0026ldquo;put away the foreign gods\u0026rdquo; can be seen as a call to return to the knowledge and understanding of the true creators and the rejection of false idols.\nThe line of thinking that idolatry was the result of forgetting the true creators and adoring pieces of stone and idols could have led to the emergence of monotheism in several ways.\nFirstly, it could have led to the idea that there was only one true God, the creator of everything, and that all other gods and idols were false and had no power. This idea may have arisen from the belief that the true creators were so powerful that they could not be represented by a physical object and therefore any such representation was a false idol.\nSecondly, the idea that idolatry was the result of forgetting the true creators may have led to the belief that a single deity or group of deities was responsible for the creation of everything, including humans. This belief could have evolved into a monotheistic religion where there is only one God who is responsible for everything in existence.\nFinally, the concept of idolatry being the result of forgetting the true creators may have led to the belief that the true creators were the only beings deserving of worship and adoration. This could have led to the development of a monotheistic religion where the worship of any other deity or idol was considered to be wrong and against the will of the true creators.\nIll. 3 - Two individuals searching for remainders Quick recap # "},{"id":"20","href":"/intro/age-of-aries/","title":"Age of Aries","description":"The Age of Aries, spanning from 2,370 to 210 BC, succeeds the Age of Taurus in the Wheel of Heaven narrative. This era is marked by significant biblical events, particularly relating to Moses, a pivotal figure in Judaism. The narrative interprets Moses' encounter with the burning bush as an interaction with advanced technology, akin to a rocket, symbolizing an extraterrestrial presence. Furthermore, this age details the liberation of the people of Israel, guided by the Elohim, who led them during the day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire, as described in the Book of Exodus.

Exodus 3: 2.\nThe passage describes a significant event in the Hebrew Bible when Moses, a key figure in Judaism, encountered an angel of Yahweh, the God of Israel. The angel appeared to Moses in a flame of fire that was emanating from a bush. Despite the fire, the bush was not consumed or burnt. This miraculous occurrence caught Moses\u0026rsquo; attention, and he approached the bush. From within the bush, the angel of Yahweh spoke to Moses and revealed his divine mission to lead the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt and into the Promised Land. Moses was chosen for a special mission.\nA rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.\nThis passage suggests that the description given in the Bible of the appearance of an angel of Yahweh in Exodus 3:2 may have been the result of an encounter with an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The author is drawing a comparison between the experience of Moses and the possible experience of a Brazilian tribesman encountering a modern-day spacecraft, implying that both encounters may have been similar in nature. The reference to illuminating the trees without burning them suggests that the spacecraft may have had some kind of advanced technology that allowed it to land without causing damage to the surrounding environment.\nThe people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.\nExodus # The beginning of Exodus describes all that we had to do to help liberate the people of Israel.

Exodus 13: 21.\nThe passage describes how the Elohim guided and helped the people of Israel to liberate themselves and led them to the land that was destined for them.

Additionally, the Age of Pisces included the birth of a significant child, born from a human mother and an extraterrestrial, inheriting unique telepathic abilities, as depicted in the biblical story of the birth of Jesus Christ​​​​​​​​.","content":"The Age of Pisces lasted from –210 BC to 1950 CE and followed the Age of Aries which lasted up to –210. This World Age just ended very recently and the transition from the Age of Pisces to the new Age of Aquarius is still being felt.\nThe importance of the Biblical scriptures # Christ’s role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything.\nThe significance of Biblical scriptures lies in their ability to convey essential truths about our existence and the world around us. Christ\u0026rsquo;s mission was to disseminate these truths globally, ensuring their preservation for future generations. In the age of science, the knowledge found in the Bible can be better understood, providing evidence and insights for humanity.\nIf we consider the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and the advent of information systems, to be synonymous with the age of science, several implications arise. The Age of Aquarius, which will be the main focus in the next chapter bearing the same name, is often associated with a time of increased knowledge, technology, and human potential. In this context, the age of science represents a period where humanity gains a deeper understanding of the world, enabling us to reexamine and reinterpret ancient wisdom, such as the Biblical scriptures, through a modern lens. During the Age of Aquarius, scientific advancements have led to remarkable discoveries and innovations, which have significantly shaped our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The development of nuclear power, for instance, has not only revolutionized energy production but also provided us with a glimpse into the immense power contained within the fabric of matter itself. Similarly, the arrival of information systems has transformed our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and access vast amounts of information at an unprecedented scale.\nJesus Christ # The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:\nShe was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Matthew 1: 18.\n"},{"id":"22","href":"/intro/age-of-aquarius/","title":"Age of Aquarius","description":"The Age of Aquarius, spanning from 1950 CE to 4110 CE, marks the current era in the Wheel of Heaven narrative, succeeding the Age of Pisces.

It represents the end of the world of the Church, reflecting a completion of its role in preparing humanity for the return of extraterrestrial creators. The Age of Pisces, identified with Christ and his apostles, transitions into the Age of Aquarius, symbolizing a period of significant change, including the reestablishment of the state of Israel in 1946. This era is characterized by a shift in global consciousness and understanding, aligning with prophecies and symbolizing transformative changes in human society and knowledge​​​​​​​​.","content":"The Age of Aquarius lasts from 1950 CE to 4110 CE and followed the Age of Pisces which lasted up to 1950 CE.

This World Age is now and is commonly referred to the New Age.\nNew Age # We transitioned into the Age of Aquarius which folloed the Age of Pisces. The transition from one World Age to the next can still be felt to this very day.\nThe time of the end of the world has arrived. Not the end of the world as in a catastrophe destroying the Earth, but the end of the world of the Church, which has completed its work. It performed this role more or less effectively. It was a task of vulgarization, making it possible for your creators to be recognized when they return. As you have noticed, the Christian church is dying. It is the end of this world because its mission has been fulfilled, albeit with quite a few mistakes because it tried for so long to deify the creators.\nThe transition into the Age of Aquarius, following the Age of Pisces, has brought about significant changes that are still felt today. This shift marks the end of the world for the Church, as its mission of spreading awareness about the creators has been completed. While the Church has faced challenges and made mistakes in trying to deify the creators, its decline signifies the fulfillment of its role in preparing for the return of these creators in the new age.\nVulgarization of the truth has been completed. The completion of the vulgarization of the Truth through the Bible and other authentic religious scriptures involves several aspects. The Bible has been translated into numerous languages and distributed across the globe, making its teachings accessible to a vast number of people, regardless of their linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\nThroughout the past 2000 years since the Bible got canonized by the Church, religious leaders, scholars, and theologians have devoted their lives to interpreting and teaching the seemingly complex narrative concepts found within the Bible. These interpretations have led to the establishment of various religious denominations and schools of thought, each offering their unique perspectives on the scripture and while preserving the overall scriptural body of the Truth getting ouf of touch which is original meaning.\nAlso, artistic expressions, such as paintings, sculptures, music, and literature, have played a vital role in conveying the Bible\u0026rsquo;s messages to a broader audience. These artistic endeavors have often simplified and illustrated the biblical stories, making them more relatable and engaging for people from all walks of life.\nThe Age of Pisces was the age of Christ and his fishermen, and the Age of Aquarius, which follows, began in 1946. This is the era in which the people of Israel found their country again:\nAnd it shall come to pass in that day\u0026hellip; that there shall be the noise of a cry from the pisces 19 gate\u0026hellip; Zephaniah 1: 10.\nIn the passage from the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains that the Age of Pisces was the age of Christ and his fishermen, while the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1946, marked the period when the people of Israel reclaimed their country. This event was prophesied in Zephaniah 1:10, referencing a cry from the Pisces gate, symbolizing the transition between the two ages and the significant changes that would follow.\nThe return of the Jewish people to Israel, as it was predicted, is a sign of the golden age:\nI will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory. Isaiah 43: 5-7.\nIn this passage from the Book Which Tells The Truth, the return of the Jewish people to Israel is highlighted as a sign of the golden age. The prophecy, as described in Isaiah 43:5-7, foretells the gathering of the Jewish people from all directions—east, west, north, and south—returning to their homeland. This event serves as a fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s plan, as they are created for \u0026ldquo;His glory\u0026rdquo; and have been called by \u0026ldquo;His name\u0026rdquo;.

Amidst this, he engaged in a strategic conflict against Perdiccas, the royal guardian of Philip III of Macedon. The ensuing turmoil led to Perdiccas\u0026rsquo;s downfall, assassinated by his own men in 320 BC, paving the way for Ptolemy I to assert his unchallenged authority over Egypt, a pivotal turn in its renowned history. This marked the beginning of the Hellenization of Egypt. In this early Hellenistic period, Ptolemy I\u0026rsquo;s reign ushered in a new era marked by the influx of Greek settlers, melding with the ancient Egyptian populace. This convergence of cultures within his kingdom presented Ptolemy with a unique challenge: to harmonize the coexistence of Greek and Egyptian societies, each with their deep-rooted traditions and beliefs, under his rule. One important aspect of both these highly esteemed and ancient cultures was the veneration for their deities. It is not difficult to imagine that both pantheons of Gods proved to be incompatible. Ptolemy\u0026rsquo;s solution to this socio-cultural puzzle would not only define his reign but also leave a lasting impact on the cultural landscape of Egypt. Namely, he introduced Serapis, a deity combining aspects of Greek gods like Zeus and Hades with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, and Apis, the sacred bull. This synthesis aimed to bridge cultural divides between the Greek and Egyptian populations, easing tensions and fostering unity under his reign. By doing so, Ptolemy established a shared religious ground, a process which is commonly known as \u0026ldquo;religious syncretism.\u0026rdquo;\nIn very simple terms, religious syncretism refers to the fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices. As the aforementioned case of Serapis suggests, there are countless examples where religious syncretism has proven to be a successful strategy by which rulers had the possibility to unify their subjects under a syncretic deity. But this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean syncretism can only serve political ends. There\u0026rsquo;s another type of religious syncretism we want to explore. The type of religious syncretism that connects the dots and shows a coherent picture of what has been and will be. Namely, that a great majority of all religions have a common source and upheld a common relationship with our creators over the passage of time. But before we get to behold this insight, at least two other concepts need to be introduced first. First, the comparative study of mythologies and religions, a field of research where myths and religions are compared in an attempt to identify shared themes and commonality. Second, the continuity of revelation, a theological concept that has been known throughout many instances of religions and yet failed to lay the intended groundwork for upcoming revelations to be properly recognized as such.\nMultiple flood accounts # In more than 2000 years, George Smith was the first to read out loud the lines of an ancient account of a Mesopotamian Flood myth that bore striking ressemblance with the Great Flood known from the Biblical Pentateuch. It was on the 3rd of December, 1872, that George Smith1, a self-taught Assyrologist read translated fragments of Assyrian cuneiform tablets before the well esteemed Society of Biblical Archeology in London. It was no easy task for him up that point. The tablet he was reading from had first to be completed before you could commence to translate them. When these tablets got discovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh by Austen Henry Layard, his assistant Hormuzd Rassam, and W. K. Loftus in the early 1850s, the tablet which contained the account was broken off at mid point. The Times of London had offered a large reward for anyone who could produce the missing tablets. George Smith thought he himself knew where to dig for the missing pieces in Nineveh. He set off to win the reward. In an unlikely manner, he managed to locate the missing pieces among thousands of other tablets within a short amount of time. The flood story was now completed and proved to be part of a larger poem, known today as the Epic of Gilgamesh. The completed account was the basis of his reading in 1872 and was published in a seminal work titled The Chaldean Account of Genesis. This was heureka moment for the scientific establishement to realize that there was an independent account of a very fundamental theme from the Bible, the flood story. For some, it meant confirmation of the Bible as holy scripture, for others it meant that the Bible had lost its credibility.\nAs of today, research has brought forward a whole plethora of documented accounts of cataclysmic flood myths worldwide. For instance, the Epic of Gilgamesh from Mesopotamia and the Biblical story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark are seminal tales of great floods sent by divine forces to purge humanity. In South Asia, the Hindu narrative of Manu echoes a similar theme of divine warning and salvation. The Greeks have their version in the story of Deucalion and his wife, Pyrrha, who repopulate the earth after a catastrophic deluge. In Africa, diverse tribes like the Kwaya, Mbuti, and Maasai each harbor unique flood stories, often reflecting a cosmic reset. Across the ocean, in the Americas, the Muisca and Inca civilizations recount floods as divine retribution, reshaping the moral and physical landscape. Similarly, Australian Aboriginal stories frequently depict great floods that sculpted the terrain. In China, the Gun-Yu myth where the theme is based on the efforts of Great Yu and Gun try to control the flood. Dà Hóngshuǐ (大洪水), simply meaning Great Flood, is another related all-encompassing Chinese flood myth. In Japan, the Ōnamazu (大鯰) myth describes a giant underground catfish causing earthquakes. It would fill pages to enumerate them all.2\nComparing mythologies # What has been made possible for everyone to see since George Smiths\u0026rsquo; traduction of the Epic of Gilgamesh, rendering the Biblical Great Flood story but one mythological account among many, wasn\u0026rsquo;t unique to the Flood motif. Also rooted in the second half of the 19th century is the work of Friedrich Max Müller. Müller, a German-born British philologist and Orientalist. His approach to mythology, which began around 1856, was deeply rooted in linguistic studies, particularly the comparative study of Indo-European languages. He proposed that the similarities and relationships among these languages could also be applied to the study of mythologies. This innovative approach paved the way for what we know as Comparative Mythology. Just as water remains water regardless of what it is called in different languages, the protagonists and figures of a given folk tale may bear different names, but may still share a thematically sound common ground. This is referred to as a mytheme, a unit of narrative features that can be used to compare different myths of seemingly unrelated origins.\nIt would seem natural to assume that only so many mytheme can be shared among world cultures, but that\u0026rsquo;s precisely where the case can be argued for when put together shared themes and motifs that the majority of cultures and peoples from around the world end up sharing. These mythemes have been so numerous and repeating themselves in various folklores that whole lists had to be compiled cataloguing each possible distinct mytheme, noting where it occurs and what its defining characteristics are. Such a catalogue is the so-called \u0026ldquo;Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\u0026rdquo;, compiled by the American folklorist Stith Thompson published in 1936 and revisited in 1958. Another index with a similar stated goal of tracking all possible folklore motifs would be Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index, named after their creators. These indices represent the essential tool for keeping track of and comparing myths and folktales. If one would ever parse such an index, one would come quickly to the realization that these bodies of work are quite exhaustive and enumerate rather obscure motifs. The point however remains. Besides the already explored Flood motif, there is a number of other motifs that are worthwhile to mention. Genesis-like motifs such as \u0026ldquo;Creation of man from clay\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Creators from above\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Sky Father\u0026rdquo;. Or more menacing motifs such as the \u0026ldquo;Primordial Chaos\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Titanomachy\u0026rdquo; (Greek for war among the gods) or the \u0026ldquo;Theft of Fire\u0026rdquo;. All of these motifs are represented well in most cultures and have an equivalent.\nComparing religions # Universalism # Progressive revelation # The common source # In the first book The Book Which Tells The Truth, at the very beginning of Chapter \u0026ldquo;At the Root of All Religions\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh says the following about religions and religious sects:\nIt is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe Kabala is the closest book to the truth, but almost all religious books allude to us with varying degrees of clarity. This is especially true in those countries where the creators had bases - in the Andes, in the Himalayas, in Greece where Greek mythology also contains important testimonies, as well as in the Buddhist and Islamic religions and among the Mormons. It would take many pages to name all the religions and sects that testify in a more or less obscure way to our work.\nThe meaning of religion # Recapping # Religious syncretism refers to the blending of different religious beliefs, practices, and cultural elements into a new, unified system. In a world where all religions were rooted in the same source - the Elohim - it could lead to a greater acceptance of syncretism and a renewed interest in finding common ground among the world\u0026rsquo;s diverse religious traditions.\nUnder this premise, the various religious texts, stories, and myths could be reinterpreted as different interpretations of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s teachings, messages, and interventions in human history. This reinterpretation could create a sense of shared spiritual heritage, potentially leading to increased dialogue, cooperation, and understanding among religious communities.\nBelievers in different faiths might be more willing to recognize similarities in their respective religious teachings and practices, and to explore the ways in which these teachings can be reconciled or integrated. This could potentially lead to the development of new syncretic religious movements or the reformation of existing ones, with a focus on the shared extraterrestrial origin as the unifying element.\nFurthermore, if the Elohim were considered the common source of all religions, discussions about religious superiority and exclusivity could be diminished, fostering increased tolerance and acceptance among people of different faiths. This could promote a more inclusive and harmonious interfaith dialogue, with the potential to reduce religious conflicts and tensions.\nGeorge Smith, a British Assyriologist from a working-class Victorian family, had limited educational opportunities. At fourteen, he apprenticed with Bradbury and Evans in London to learn banknote engraving, where he excelled. He was captivated by Assyrian culture and history from a young age, reading extensively on the subject in his spare time. His passion led him to spend lunch hours at the British Museum, studying cuneiform tablets discovered near Mosul, Iraq by Layard, Rawlinson, and Rassam during the 1840-1855 archaeological expeditions. In 1863, Smith married Mary Clifton, and they had six children. His natural talent for cuneiform was first noticed by Samuel Birch. Smith\u0026rsquo;s most significant achievements include deciphering the Epic of Gilgamesh, particularly the flood narrative, significantly advancing the understanding of Assyrian and Babylonian cultures and histories. In March 1876, the British Museum trustees sent him to excavate more of the Library of Ashurbanipal. Tragically, Smith fell ill with dysentery in İkizce, a village near Aleppo, and died there at the age of 36 on 19 August.

Firstly, it symbolizes the precessional cycle of 25'920 years, which encompasses the journey through the 12 World Ages. Each Age corresponds to one of the zodiacal constellations, marking a grand celestial journey. Secondly, this term encapsulates the metaphorical destiny of humanity as a potential space-colonizing civilization. It suggests a narrative where humanity must first resolve its internal conflicts and destructive impulses to reach a future where we can venture to new stars and seed life on other planets.

It postulates that an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, known as the Elohim, were responsible for creating life on Earth. This idea forms the foundation of our exploration, seeking to blend ancient narratives, modern interpretation, and scientific inquiry to understand our origins and place in the universe.\nQ: Is this project an endorsement or defense of Raëlian beliefs? # A: Not exactly. While \u0026lsquo;Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo; draws upon the foundational concepts of Raëlism, it is an independent endeavor. Our aim is to delve deeper into the narrative established by Raëlism, going beyond where the current Raëlian institution has ventured in terms of extracanonical material. This project is about expanding and exploring those ideas further, offering new perspectives and insights that complement yet remain independent in its assessment and evaluations. See more: Wiki › Raëlism\nQ: I\u0026rsquo;ve never come across the term \u0026lsquo;Elohim\u0026rsquo; before. Is this a name you created to add credibility to your hypothesis? # A: Actually, \u0026lsquo;Elohim\u0026rsquo; is an ancient word with deep roots in religious texts. It\u0026rsquo;s the Hebrew term for \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; as used in the Bible. An interesting aspect of this word is that it\u0026rsquo;s plural, implying a collective or group rather than a singular entity. Moreover, \u0026lsquo;Elohim\u0026rsquo; shares a linguistic kinship with the Akkadian word \u0026lsquo;ilum\u0026rsquo;. Represented by the cuneiform symbol 𒀭, which portrays a star, \u0026lsquo;ilum\u0026rsquo; translates to \u0026lsquo;sky\u0026rsquo;. Thus, \u0026lsquo;Elohim\u0026rsquo; could be interpreted as \u0026lsquo;Celestials\u0026rsquo;, hinting at beings from the sky or stars. This connection not only enriches the term\u0026rsquo;s meaning but also aligns intriguingly with our hypothesis. See more: Wiki › Elohim\nQ: Does the hypothesis challenge contemporary scientific paradigms? # A: Indeed, our hypothesis actively challenges several established scientific paradigms, too many to enumerate each and every one of them. For example, it questions the conventional understanding of human origins by proposing that an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the Elohim, played a direct role in creating life on Earth. This notion intersects with and challenges the fields of evolutionary biology and anthropology, which traditionally attribute human origins to gradual evolutionary processes. Additionally, the hypothesis intersects with astrobiology, particularly in its exploration of extraterrestrial life. By suggesting that humanity itself is a product of extraterrestrial intervention, it prompts a re-examination of the criteria and conditions we consider necessary for life in the universe. See more: Wiki › Intelligent Design\nQ: Does challenging established scientific paradigms make your hypothesis less likely to be accurate? # A: Challenging established scientific paradigms does not necessarily make a hypothesis less likely to be accurate; in fact, the history of science is replete with examples where groundbreaking ideas initially faced skepticism. Consider the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, which was radically contrary to the prevailing geocentric view but eventually revolutionized our understanding of the solar system.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that what are considered \u0026lsquo;big ideas\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;all-encompassing narratives\u0026rsquo; in science often undergo significant revision or are even replaced as new evidence emerges and understanding deepens. For instance, current concepts like the speed of light as the ultimate speed barrier, the long-term impacts of climate change, or the validity of String Theory, while widely accepted now, may evolve or be supplanted by new theories as our knowledge expands.\nHistorically, science tends to progress more reliably through incremental advancements that demonstrate their practical utility in engineering and other applied fields. These small steps contribute to a more robust and tested body of knowledge, rather than relying solely on grand, sweeping theories about the nature of reality. Therefore, while our hypothesis challenges current paradigms, it aligns with the dynamic nature of scientific progress, where questioning and re-evaluating established ideas is a fundamental part of the journey towards deeper understanding.\nQ: Are there other hypotheses or theories similar to yours? Do any share common premises with your approach? # A: Indeed, our hypothesis shares some ground with various existing theories, yet it stands out through its unique synthesis of diverse concepts. We weave together elements from different schools of thought that are not traditionally combined. Key themes resonating with our hypothesis include the ancient astronaut hypothesis, aspects of intelligent design or creationism, and the significance of ancient scriptures like the Bible. Particularly, we explore the alignment of the first 7 World Ages with the biblical seven days of creation.\nMoreover, our approach sheds new light on the onset of the Age of Aquarius, often associated with messianism and a time when hidden truths are revealed. While these ideas are usually considered in isolation or interpreted through conventional lenses, such as in Christian tradition, our hypothesis stands apart. We integrate these varied elements—spanning from the ancient astronaut theory to the mystical interpretations of astrological ages—into a singular, comprehensive narrative. This approach creates a cohesive body of inquiry that offers a fresh perspective on these interrelated themes, inviting a deeper understanding of our place in the cosmos.\nResources and navigation # Q: What resources does Wheel of Heaven provide for understanding this hypothesis? # A: The website offers a comprehensive introduction exploring the whole narrative, a detailed wiki explaining concepts and ideas encountered in this narrative, and a curated resources section with books, websites, and audiovisual media to expand upon the premises presented.\nThe Great Year and World Ages # Q: What is the \u0026lsquo;Great Year\u0026rsquo; and its significance in the hypothesis? # A: The \u0026lsquo;Great Year\u0026rsquo;, pivotal in our hypothesis, is an astronomical cycle spanning approximately 25,920 years. This period is divided into 12 World Ages, each aligning with one of the zodiacal constellations. These Ages provide a framework to understand vast historical and cosmic cycles. In our hypothesis, the \u0026lsquo;Great Year\u0026rsquo; is not just a measure of time but a narrative tool that weaves together the journey of humanity and the purported interventions of the Elohim over these extended epochs. See more: Wiki › Great Year\nQ: What are these 12 segments and how long does one last? # A: These 12 segments are referred to as \u0026lsquo;World Ages\u0026rsquo;, each lasting about 2'160 years. During a World Age, the Sun rises in the same zodiacal constellation at the vernal equinox. Presently, we are transitioning from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, a significant shift in our hypothesis. Each Age is marked by distinct celestial influences and developments in human civilization, aligning with our overarching narrative of celestial intervention from our creators, the Elohim. See more: Wiki › World Age\nQ: How do different World Ages factor into the hypothesis? # A: In our hypothesis, each World Age represents a distinct phase in Earth\u0026rsquo;s development and the activities of the Elohim. Starting with the Age of Capricorn, which we propose as the time of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s arrival on Earth, each Age signifies different interactions and influences of these celestial beings. These Ages chronicle a journey of the creation of life on Earth, in particular that of humanity under their guidance, from our earliest beginnings to our potential future as a space-faring civilization.\nQ: You mentioned a transition from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. Can you elaborate on the significance of this shift? # A: Indeed, this transition, often referred to in popular culture as the New Age or the Age of Apocalypse, is not a new concept, but it holds profound significance in our hypothesis. We see this astrological shift as a pivotal moment for humanity. It\u0026rsquo;s a time where we\u0026rsquo;re on the brink of monumental advancements, yet also at a crossroads where we possess the power to either destroy ourselves or reach the next level of maturity.\nAccording to our understanding, the emergence of technologies and energies capable of self-destruction coincides with this astrological transition. It presents an ultimate challenge – to overcome our internal conflicts and prove ourselves worthy of the advanced legacy bestowed upon us by our creators, the Elohim. Successfully navigating this period without self-annihilation is crucial.\nWe believe that if humanity can rise above its destructive tendencies, this will be the signal for the Elohim to reveal themselves globally, confirming their role in our creation and development. Such a positive outcome would usher in the much-anticipated Golden Age, marking our readiness to join the ranks of space-colonizing civilizations and inherit the full scope of our creators\u0026rsquo; scientific and technological prowess.

Bigliardi provides an overview of Sendy's life and work, including his theories on the origins of humanity, the influence of extraterrestrial beings, and the possible connections between various mythologies and ancient cultures.","content":"In his paper \u0026ldquo;A Gentleman’s Joyous Esotericism: Jean Sendy Above and Beyond the Ancient Aliens,\u0026rdquo; Stefano Bigliardi discusses the work of Jean Sendy, a French esoteric writer who explored the idea of ancient astronauts and extraterrestrial intervention in human history. Bigliardi provides an overview of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s life and work, including his theories on the origins of humanity, the influence of extraterrestrial beings, and the possible connections between various mythologies and ancient cultures.\nBigliardi argues that while Sendy\u0026rsquo;s ideas are often associated with the contemporary \u0026ldquo;ancient aliens\u0026rdquo; movement, his work is more nuanced and sophisticated than the simplistic and often sensationalist claims of some modern authors. Sendy drew on a wide range of sources, including mythology, ancient texts, and scientific theories, to develop his ideas. He also emphasized the need for critical thinking and careful analysis of evidence, rather than simply accepting or rejecting theories based on preconceived notions.\nOverall, Bigliardi suggests that Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work is an interesting and valuable contribution to the study of esotericism and the search for meaning in human history, and encourages readers to engage with his ideas in a thoughtful and critical manner.\nAbstract # The paper was published in September 2016, focusing on the works and ideologies of Jean Sendy, a French author. It delves into a bibliography of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s works, highlighting titles such as \u0026ldquo;Les cahiers de cours de Moïse,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;La lune clé de la Bible,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Nous autres, gens du Moyen Age,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;L’ère du Verseau, fin de l’illusion humaniste.\u0026rdquo;\nJean Sendy proposed various theories and interpretations about ancient civilizations and their interactions with extraterrestrial beings, which he referred to as \u0026ldquo;Theosites.\u0026rdquo; He theorized that certain ancient monuments, like the Pyramids, the archaeological remains in Tihuanaco, Bolivia, and the Temple of Baalbek in Lebanon, might have been constructed using advanced techniques introduced by these extraterrestrial entities.\nCentral to Sendy\u0026rsquo;s narrative is the idea that Theosites visited Earth, imparting their knowledge to humans. This wisdom was preserved as a \u0026ldquo;Tradition\u0026rdquo; by select civilizations, leading to their flourishing. In contrast, those who strayed from this Tradition encountered adversities.\nThe document also touches upon the influences on Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work. It suggests that he might have drawn inspiration from other authors and thinkers, including Matest Mendeleiev Agrest and Alexander Kazantsev, who also ventured into theories about extraterrestrials and ancient human history.\nOn a side note, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s own interpretation of world history, especially the conflict between Nazism and Catholicism, is explored. Having lived through the atrocities of Nazi Germany, these experiences deeply influenced his writings. He perceived Catholicism as a beacon of rationality and was critical of ideologies like Communism, Nazism, and capitalism.\nThis is a quote directly taken from the paper\u0026rsquo;s abstract itself:\nThe article reconstructs the narratives advanced by the author Jean Sendy (1910-1978). His life is reconstructed as well. It is argued that Sendy was a cultivated, sophisticated and ironic author, deeply different, by virtue of his books’ quality, from other proponents of the “ancient aliens” narratives with whom he is often paired.\nAbout Stefano Bigliardi # Stefano Bigliardi is an Italian scholar of religion and philosopher. He is currently an associate professor of philosophy of science and religion at the Department of Educational Sciences of the University of Bergamo in Italy. He has published extensively on topics such as the relationship between science and religion, the history and philosophy of Islamic science, and the study of esotericism and mysticism.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Year Wiki › Precession\n"},{"id":"33","href":"/wiki/abraham/","title":"Abraham","description":"Abraham, originally called Abram or, in Hebrew, Avram. He is a Biblical patriarch from the times after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. He is the first ambassador or prophet appointed by the civilization of the Elohim and held a non-hostile diplomatic relationship with them.","content":"Abraham is a central figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and is considered the father of these three monotheistic religions. In the Bible, he is described as the father of Isaac and a patriarch of the Israelites. In the Tanakh, he is considered the first Hebrew and the founder of the Jewish nation. In the Quran, Abraham is considered a prophet of Allah and a friend of God.\nIn the Bible, Abraham is described as:\nA Chaldean from Ur, who was called by God to leave his home and journey to a new land (Genesis 12:1-3) A faithful servant of God who was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22) The founder of the covenant between God and the Israelites, through which God promised to make Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants a great nation (Genesis 12:1-3, 15:18) The ancestor of Jesus (Matthew 1:1-17) Historical context # Abraham is a central figure in the Abrahamic religions as previousley mentioned, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. His life, as per religious tradition, is thought to have taken place around 2000 BCE, though it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that this is not a historically verifiable timeline since written history doesn\u0026rsquo;t extend well that far back in the Middle East.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s story begins in the Book of Genesis, where it\u0026rsquo;s mentioned that he was born in Ur of the Chaldeans1, spelled אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים (ʾūr Kaśdīm) in the Hebrew Bible, an ancient city-state in the region we now call southern Iraq. This location, situated between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is part of Mesopotamia, one of the cradles of human civilization. In Abraham\u0026rsquo;s time, this region was likely a complex landscape of various city-states, small kingdoms, and tribal alliances.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s father, Terah, decided to move the family from Ur towards Canaan, but they ended up settling in Haran. Haran was located further north, near the modern border between Turkey and Syria. It was an important hub of trade and exerted a considerable amount of cultural and religious influence in the region.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s journey continued when the Elohim commanded him to leave Haran and travel to Canaan. The land of Canaan corresponds roughly to today\u0026rsquo;s Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Jordan and Syria, with a location along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, a region often referred to as the Levant. In biblical times, Canaan was a patchwork of various city-states, each having its own king.\nDuring a severe famine, Abraham and his wife Sarai (later renamed Sarah) undertook a journey to Egypt. Egypt, a remarkable civilization in northeast Africa, was one of the world\u0026rsquo;s earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, centered along the fertile Nile River. It would have been a powerful kingdom and a hub of culture and learning in the ancient world at the time of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s visit.\nLater in his life, Abraham made his home in Hebron, a city in the southern part of Canaan. Hebron is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world and is of great religious importance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It is in Hebron that the Cave of the Patriarchs, the supposed burial site of Abraham and Sarah, is located.\nEtymology # The name \u0026ldquo;Abraham\u0026rdquo; comes from the Hebrew name אַבְרָהָם (Avraham). It\u0026rsquo;s composed of two parts: \u0026ldquo;Av\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;raham\u0026rdquo;, which is thought to mean \u0026ldquo;multitude\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo;. Thus, the name Abraham is often interpreted as \u0026ldquo;father of many\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;father of a multitude\u0026rdquo;.2 Initially, his name was Abram (אַבְרָם)3, meaning \u0026ldquo;exalted father\u0026rdquo;, but it was changed to Abraham after God\u0026rsquo;s promise that he would become the father of many nations (Genesis 17:5).\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Abraham is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with Raël. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, showcases the mentioning of Abraham:\nLater, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.\nLay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. — Genesis 22: 12.4\nThis passage is discussing a story from the book of Genesis in the Bible, where the Elohim wanted to test the people of Israel, particularly their leader, Abraham, to see if they still held positive feelings towards them. At the time of the test, the people had relapsed into a semi-primitive state after many of their intellectuals were destroyed. The test involved Abraham being asked to sacrifice his own son, and his willingness to do so was taken as a sign of his loyalty and devotion to the creators. The creators ultimately intervened and prevented the sacrifice, indicating that they were satisfied with Abraham\u0026rsquo;s loyalty.\nLegacy # Abraham is a pivotal figure in the Adamite struggle, particularly known for his role in the aftermath of the cataclysm that wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah. As a leader of the remainder of the Adamite community, he played a significant part in fostering a renewed relationship with the Elohim creators, a relationship strained by the sequence of catastrophic events and the societal upheaval they caused.\nIn a key episode known as the Sacrifice of Abraham, the creators tested Abraham\u0026rsquo;s loyalty and his community\u0026rsquo;s sentiments towards them. This event is portrayed as a testament of faith, with Abraham willing to sacrifice his son in response to a perceived command from the creators. The test was not to examine Abraham\u0026rsquo;s obedience, but rather to assess the strength of the positive feelings and the quality of the relationship the Adamites had towards their creators.\nIn a symbolic gesture, the creators intervened just as Abraham was about to carry out the sacrifice, thereby indicating the completion of the test and signifying their satisfaction with the outcome. This event confirmed the Adamites\u0026rsquo; loyalty to their creators, marking a critical turning point in the relationship between the creators and their synthetic progeny.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s unwavering loyalty and his subsequent actions laid the groundwork for a renewed relationship between the Adamites and the Elohim.\nOur take # One of the main aspects of the Wheel of Heaven exegesis is that the whole timeline of the events described in the Biblical scriptures and subsequently in the Raëlian revelations happen within one precessional cycle of 25\u0026#39;920 years. Considering this, the events during Abraham\u0026rsquo;s lifetime are presumed to have occured during the Age of Taurus, a period of time that falls between 4'530 to 2'370 BCE.\nAbraham served as an important caesura in the relationship between human beings on Earth and their extraterrestrial creator parents, the Elohim. Up until that point, human beings enjoyed a certain level of self-determination and autonomy. After the Great Flood cataclysmically reset life on Earth and the planet had to be repopulated, the postdiluvian human civilization grew fast demographically and technologically with the help of the banished creators that also had to remain on Earth and the technology and scientif wealth either safeguarded during the cataclysm or salvaged thereafter.\nThe banished creators were pardoned and had left since the days of the diplomatic spacecraft mission commonly known as the Tower of Babel, progress and the level of scientific sophistication vanished with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, both cities the remaining two centers of innovation. Abraham served the purpose of being prove that humanity remained non-hostile and became one of the first ambassadors (prophet) appointed by the Elohim to preserve their legacy.\nSee also # Wiki › Prophet Wiki › Sodom and Gomorrah Wiki › Tower of Babel Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Taurus # Abraham External links # Abraham | Wikipedia Abraham (Hebrew Patriach) | Britannica Abraham | Jewish Encyclopedia Abraham, the Patriach | World History Encyclopedia The word אוּר (\u0026lsquo;ur) is a loanword from the Sumerian 𒋀𒀕𒆠 (urim₅ki, pronounced urim), both meaning city.

They are considered the first human beings created by God, and are believed to have lived in the Garden of Eden before disobeying God\u0026rsquo;s command and being expelled from the garden (Genesis 3). Adam is described as the first man created by God from the dust of the ground, while Eve is described as the first woman, created from one of Adam\u0026rsquo;s ribs (Genesis 2:7, 2:22). Adam and Eve\u0026rsquo;s story is often seen as an allegory for the origin of sin and the fall of humanity.\nEtymology # The etymology of the name of both Adam and Eve is uncertain, and several etymological theories have been proposed for each name on their own.\nOne theory is that the name Adam is derived from the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adamah\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;soil\u0026rdquo;.1 This is in line with the biblical account of Adam being formed from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7).

Another theory is that the name Eve is related to the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;haya\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;to live\u0026rdquo;. This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Eve as the source of life for all humankind. In addition, the name Eve has been connected to the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;awwatu\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;living one\u0026rdquo;, further emphasizing the idea of Eve as a symbol of life and vitality.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Adam and Eve are mentioned briefly by Yahweh.

In the story, the Serpent, a group of the Elohim creators that wanted their genetically engineered children to know about their origins, tells Adam and Eve the truth, which results in the Serpentine group being judged by the governing body of the Elohimian civilization, which forced them to live in exile on Earth from theron.

These offspring integrated into the Adamite community, creating a unified yet distinct group comprised of both hybrid and non-hybrid Adamites, who collectively strove for intellectual and political emancipation from their creators, the Elohim, navigating through stages of enlightenment, rebellion, and retribution while persisting in their quest for recognition and independence.","content":"Sequence of events # The Adamite Struggle refers an to epoch-spanning struggle that started in the Age of Leo, which delineates the course of humanity\u0026rsquo;s evolution from their creation to their eventual emergence as independent and autonomous entities. This narrative presents the perspective of the human Adamites, who were embroiled in a complex political struggle against their creators, the Elohim.\nThe Adamites, also referred to as early human beings in Eden, were created by Elohimite scientists on Earth. Initially, these beings were kept in ignorance about the identity of their creators, who presented themselves as divine figures. This dynamic changed when Lucifer, a leading Elohimite scientist, revealed to the Adamites their true origin, thereby sparking an intellectual revolution among the humans.\nThis act of enlightenment was viewed as insubordination by the governing body of the Elohim\u0026#39;s home planet. In response, Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals, enacted punitive measures, resulting in the eviction of the Adamites from their idyllic living conditions known as the Garden of Eden. Despite this expulsion, the Adamites showcased remarkable adaptability and resilience, leveraging their newfound knowledge and innate potential.\nAs their civilization advanced, the Adamites attempted an ambitious space exploration project, constructing the Tower of Babel as a symbol of their technological prowess. This interstellar mission aimed to gain pardon and acknowledgment from the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. However, these efforts were perceived as aggressive by the Elohim, leading to a period of disruption where the Adamites were scattered and their common language confounded.\nDespite the setbacks, the tenacity of the Adamites eventually led to their recognition by the Elohim, marking a milestone in their journey towards independence.

This distinct population then merged into a singular group, collectively known as the Adamites.\nEtymology # The etymology of the name of both Adam and Adamites is uncertain, and several etymological theories have been proposed.\nOne theory is that the name Adam is derived from the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adamah\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;soil\u0026rdquo;.1 This is in line with the biblical account of Adam being formed from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7). Another theory is that the name \u0026ldquo;Adam\u0026rdquo; is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;adamu\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;to make\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to create.\u0026rdquo; This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Adam as the first human being created by God. A third theory is that the name \u0026ldquo;Adam\u0026rdquo; is related to the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adom,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;.2 This interpretation is based on the idea that the color red symbolizes life and vitality, and that the name Adam reflects the idea of the first human as the source of life.\nIn other words, we can assume that Adamites is best understood as \u0026ldquo;Earthlings\u0026rdquo; as in \u0026ldquo;of the Earth\u0026rdquo;.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # In his book The Naked Bible author Biglino provides an intriguing perspective on the identity of the Adamites:\nAnyone familiar with his work knows exactly what he is referring to, namely the cloning that Genesis, allegedly, talks about to explain the appearance of the Adamites.

They also argue that certain technological and cultural advancements in human history, such as the building of the pyramids in Egypt or the creation of the Nazca lines in Peru, could not have been achieved without outside influence.\nHistorical development # The roots of the ancient astronauts hypothesis can be traced back to the 19th and early 20th centuries when people started to interpret ancient myths, religions, and artwork through the lens of the then-burgeoning field of science fiction.\nLate 19th Century: Early 20th Century: Authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, in his science fiction works, often mentioned the idea of ancient extraterrestrial beings influencing human history. Charles Fort, in the early 20th century, collected accounts of what he considered anomalies, many of which would later be interpreted by others as evidence of ancient astronauts.\n1950s-1960s: The hypothesis gained more popularity in the mid-20th century. Desmond Leslie and George Adamski\u0026rsquo;s book \u0026ldquo;Flying Saucers Have Landed\u0026rdquo; (1953) suggested that ancient civilizations on Earth were influenced by extraterrestrial visitors. Erich von Däniken’s \u0026ldquo;Chariots of the Gods?\u0026rdquo; (1968) popularized the ancient astronaut theory with a wider audience. The book suggested that many ancient monuments, such as the Egyptian Pyramids or the statues on Easter Island, were built with the help of extraterrestrials.\n1970s-1980s: This period saw the hypothesis becoming part of popular culture, featuring in films, television series, and comic books. The \u0026ldquo;Ancient Aliens\u0026rdquo; theory, as it is now commonly known, continued to grow in popularity despite strong criticism from the scientific community.\n1990s-Present: Despite ongoing criticism and lack of empirical evidence, the ancient astronaut hypothesis has continued to hold a certain appeal. The History Channel\u0026rsquo;s series \u0026ldquo;Ancient Aliens\u0026rdquo; (starting in 2009) has given the theory ongoing exposure to a large audience, despite widespread criticism for presenting pseudoscience as factual.\nList of proponents # Here are some of the most well-known proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis:\nMatest M. Agrest (1915–2005): A Russian mathematician who made a number of assertions such as that the megalithic stone terracing at Baalbek had been used as a launch site for spaceships, and that the destruction of Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of a nuclear explosion detonated by extraterrestrial beings.\nJacques Bergier (1912–1978): A French writer who co-authored \u0026ldquo;The Morning of the Magicians\u0026rdquo; (1960) with Louis Pauwels, which explored various occult and paranormal topics, including the idea that ancient civilizations had contact with extraterrestrial beings.\nMauro Biglino (1950–): An Italian author and translator who has written extensively about ancient texts and proposes that they describe interactions with extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book \u0026ldquo;The Book That Will Forever Change Our Ideas About the Bible\u0026rdquo; (2011).\nGraham Cairns-Smith (1931–2016): A British chemist and author who proposed the idea that life on Earth may have been seeded by extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book \u0026ldquo;Genetic Takeover and the Mineral Origins of Life\u0026rdquo; (1982).\nRobert Charroux (1909–1978): A French author who wrote several books on alternative history and ancient mysteries, including \u0026ldquo;One Hundred Thousand Years of Man\u0026rsquo;s Unknown History\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Mysterious Unknown.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid Hatcher Childress (1957–): A French-born American author and publisher of books on ancient mysteries and alternative history, including \u0026ldquo;Technology of the Gods\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America.\u0026rdquo;\nErich von Däniken (1935–): A Swiss author of \u0026ldquo;Chariots of the Gods?\u0026rdquo; (1968) and many other books promoting the idea that ancient monuments and artifacts were created by extraterrestrial visitors.\nSalvador Freixedo (1923–2019): A Spanish author and former Jesuit priest who has written extensively about ufology and the ancient astronaut hypothesis, including \u0026ldquo;Mission to the Stars\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Diabolical UFOs.\u0026rdquo;\nMorris K.

While these structures may or may not have been built by the same civilization, they can be characterized as having been built by ancient builders by a number of peculiar fingerprints such as megalithic building elements, the polygonial interlocking of these elements and astronomical alignements.","content":"Ancient Builders typically refers to the architects, engineers, and skilled workers who created structures, such as buildings, temples, pyramids, and other monumental structures, in ancient civilizations. These ancient builders used a variety of materials and techniques, depending on the resources and technological abilities available to them. They often incorporated elements of sacred geometry, religious beliefs, and cultural symbols into their structures, which were sometimes used for religious or political purposes.\nExamples of ancient builders include the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan temples, the Parthenon in Greece, and the Roman Colosseum, among many others. These ancient builders have had a lasting impact on architecture and engineering, inspiring and influencing later generations of architects, engineers, and builders.\nThe notion of Ancient Builders is usually understood within the realm of an alleged Ancient Builder race. It refers to the idea that a lost or unknown race of highly advanced people existed in the distant past and were responsible for constructing many of the ancient structures and monuments found around the world.\nProponents of this idea argue that these structures, such as pyramids, stone circles, and megaliths, are too complex and sophisticated to have been built by the civilizations that are known to have lived in the areas where they are found. They suggest that this ancient race may have had advanced knowledge of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy, and that they left behind evidence of their existence in the form of these structures.\nMegalithic Structures # Megalithic structures are large, often ancient, monuments or edifices created from sizable stones or boulders. The term ‘megalithic’ originates from Greek, with \u0026lsquo;mega\u0026rsquo; meaning \u0026rsquo;large\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026rsquo;lithos\u0026rsquo; meaning \u0026lsquo;stone\u0026rsquo;. These structures are found globally, with some of the most famous examples including the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge in England, and the Moai of Easter Island.\nThe builders of megalithic structures used primitive tools and techniques to create them. It\u0026rsquo;s often speculated that these buildings were created using a combination of physical labor, simple machines such as levers and ramps, and possibly even a deep understanding of acoustics and resonance frequencies. The megalithic stones are often fitted together in intricate patterns, which can suggest a level of mathematical and geometrical knowledge beyond what is typically attributed to these ancient societies.\nThese structures often exhibit astonishing precision. For instance, the stones used in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza were cut with such exactness that the gaps between them are often just a few millimeters wide. Similarly, Stonehenge\u0026rsquo;s positioning relates to celestial events like the solstices, indicating advanced knowledge of astronomy.\nHeavy stonework # One of the most baffling aspects of these megalithic sites is the use of extremely heavy stone blocks, often weighing several tons, that were quarried and transported over significant distances, including uphill to mountainous or elevated locations. This conundrum is intensified when considering that the civilizations attributed to these constructions did not have the wheel, iron tools, or any known form of advanced technology that could facilitate such an endeavour.\nFor example, the stones used in the construction of Stonehenge, known as bluestones, were sourced from a quarry over 200 kilometers away, in the Preseli Hills in Wales. Similarly, the massive granite blocks used in the Pyramids of Giza were quarried at Aswan, more than 800 kilometers away.\nIn South America, the fortress of Sacsayhuamán in Peru is built from stones weighing up to 200 tons, transported from quarries located several kilometers away, and then lifted and placed at altitudes exceeding 3,000 meters.\nHow these enormous stone blocks were moved, lifted, and meticulously placed remains one of the greatest mysteries of our ancient past. It\u0026rsquo;s these seemingly insurmountable challenges that have given rise to theories suggesting the involvement of an advanced builder race, or the Elohim, as it appears beyond the capacity of our known ancient civilizations to have achieved these feats with the technologies presumed to have been available to them.\nCyclopean masonry # A common characteristic seen in many megalithic sites worldwide is the use of polygonal masonry, where the stones are cut into a variety of polygonal shapes and sizes and fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle. This technique, also known as cyclopean masonry, is a testament to the high level of sophistication and skill possessed by these ancient builders. Remarkably, despite the irregularity of each stone\u0026rsquo;s shape, the stones fit together so precisely that it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to insert even a thin blade between them. Examples of this type of construction can be found globally, from the ancient Greek structures in Argolis to the Andean walls of Cusco and Sacsayhuamán in Peru. This architectural style has puzzled historians and engineers, as the technology needed to achieve such precision is typically associated with much more recent times. The consistent presence of polygonal masonry in ancient, geographically diverse sites has fueled speculation about a global, advanced ancient builder race, potentially linked to the extraterrestrial Elohim as the architects of these structures.\nAstronomical alignements # Many megalithic structures showcase a clear intent of aligning to celestial bodies or events, suggesting advanced knowledge of astronomy and the movements of heavenly bodies among the builders. The incorporation of such celestial alignments is seen in monuments across the world, and they often correspond to important astronomical occurrences such as solstices, equinoxes, and the rise or set of particular stars or constellations.\nThe Pyramids of Giza, for instance, are famously aligned with the constellation Orion, with the three pyramids mimicking the layout of Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt. Orion was associated with the Egyptian god Osiris, indicating a cultural as well as astronomical significance.\nIn Europe, the ancient site of Newgrange in Ireland is designed such that during the Winter Solstice, a narrow beam of sunlight illuminates its inner chamber, a phenomenon that requires precise architectural planning and understanding of solar movements.\nSignificant is the recurring reference to the Pleiades and the Zodiac across various cultures and their monuments. The Pleiades, a cluster of stars, were important to numerous ancient cultures worldwide, and many monuments, like the pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, have been found to align with them.\nIn terms of the Zodiac, it\u0026rsquo;s believed that some monuments\u0026rsquo; design incorporates the understanding of the precession of the equinoxes. The precession is a slow shift in Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis that takes about 26,000 years to complete a cycle. This understanding of the precession suggests knowledge of long-term astronomical cycles.\nThese precise alignments and astronomical references embedded in megalithic architecture defy simple explanation and point towards an advanced understanding of the heavens. Some argue that such knowledge might imply the influence or direct involvement of an advanced extraterrestrial race, such as the Elohim, in guiding or inspiring these constructions.\nExamples of megalithic sites # The Giza pyramid complex: The Egyptian pyramids, particularly the three Great Pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the most iconic megalithic structures. The precision in design and the scale of construction have fueled speculation about the builders\u0026rsquo; identity and methods. These pyramids, built as tombs for the pharaohs, align with the Orion constellation, suggesting advanced astronomical knowledge.\nMachu Picchu: The megalithic structures at Machu Picchu, Peru, provide another example of advanced construction techniques. The structures were built from large stone blocks that fit together without the use of mortar, known as ashlar masonry, with such precision that even a blade of grass cannot be inserted between the stones.\nSee the list of megalithic sites for more examples of megalithic constructions.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim known as the Serpent came to hide in the oceans and how the Elohim built bases and residences on top of high mountain peaks:\nFor by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.\n— Wisdom of Solomon 13: 5.\nSo it is simple to see the truth, recognizing the creators by observing their creations.\nAnd could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is.\n— Wisdom of Solomon 13: 1.\nTo avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nThe passage suggests that it is easy to recognize the Elohim, the creators by observing their creations, such as monumental architecture, and that the creators built their bases on high mountains and at the bottom of the sea to avoid being disturbed by humans. As time went on, the mountain stations were gradually abandoned in favor of submarine bases.\nIn another passage, Yahweh mentions how Ezekiel for instance was brought by an Elohimian craft to the base on top of a mountain:\nAnd the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea\u0026hellip;\n— Ezekiel 11: 23-24.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThis \u0026ldquo;city\u0026rdquo; is one of the Earth bases that the creators used at that time. They were always located on very high mountains so that the creators would not be disturbed by humans. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe interpretation given is that the city referred to is one of the Earth bases that the Elohim, the creators used at the time, and that they were always located on high mountains to avoid being disturbed by humans.\nSee also # Wiki › Archaeoastronomy Wiki › List of megalithic sites Wiki › Precession Wiki › Sacred Geometry Wiki › Serpent External links # "},{"id":"41","href":"/wiki/antediluvian/","title":"Antediluvian","description":"Antediluvian, the time period of life on Earth that preceeded the Great Flood.

In exchange, the leaders of these humans were allowed to benefit from the Tree of Life, which is said to have allowed them to live extremely long lives.\nHowever, the creators also took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives. The resulting children were exceptional, but longevity was not hereditary and the secret of life was lost. The offspring of the creators and humans became known as \u0026ldquo;mighty men of old, men of renown\u0026rdquo;.\nThe scientific progress on Earth during this time was deemed dangerous by those on the distant planet, and they decided to destroy what had been created.

At the climax of these events, there will be a final battle between good and evil, and Jesus Christ will return to Earth to defeat Satan and establish a new heaven and a new earth.\nThe exact nature and timing of the events described in the Apocalypse are a matter of interpretation and have been the subject of much debate throughout history. Some believe that the Apocalypse is a literal depiction of the end of the world, while others interpret it symbolically or allegorically. Regardless of one\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, the Apocalypse is a central aspect of many Christian beliefs about the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ.\nEtymology # The word \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; originates from the Ancient Greek term \u0026ldquo;ἀποκάλυψις\u0026rdquo; (apokálupsis), which means to reveal or unveil.1 It is related to the Greek word \u0026ldquo;κᾰλῠ́πτω\u0026rdquo; (kalúptō) meaning \u0026ldquo;to hide\u0026rdquo;.2 In Greek mythology, Calypso, the daughter of the Titan Atlas, is a character who embodies the concept of hiding knowledge. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; refers to the uncovering of knowledge that was previously hidden or concealed.\nContrary to popular belief, \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; does not necessarily signify a cataclysmic or apocalyptic event that marks the end of days. Instead, it denotes a period of time during which a series of revelations will reveal the truth. In the Age of Apocalypse, people will gain access to knowledge that was previously unknown or hidden, leading to a better understanding of the world and its workings.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter The Keys, the Apocalypse as the Age of Revelation is mentioned in the context of being one of the keys to unlock our potential:\nDo not forget that the Apocalypse —literally the \u0026ldquo;age of revelation\u0026rdquo;— has arrived as was predicted. It has been said that when the time comes, there will be many false prophets. You only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come. False prophets are writers of horoscopes of which the newspapers are full, and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the Elohim to the primitive people of ancient times.\nSuch false prophets prefer to believe what narrow-minded and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. They should instead believe the message of the Elohim that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky. These latter people try to understand the universe, and they can be addressed as adults.\nThis passage discusses the arrival of the Apocalypse, also known as the Age of Revelation, and the presence of false prophets during this time. The author argues that false prophets can be found in those who reject the benefits of science and instead cling to ancient writings that were given to primitive people by the Elohim.\nThe author suggests that these primitive people fearfully copied down messages from those they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. However, the author argues that people should instead believe the message of the Elohim that is being given now to people who try to understand their place in the universe and can be addressed as adults.\nThe context of this passage is the Age of Apocalypse, which is a concept found in various religions and refers to a time of great upheaval and change. The author suggests that in this time of change, it is important to listen to the message of the Elohim, rather than false prophets who hold on to narrow-minded and primitive beliefs. The author also emphasizes the importance of scientific understanding and critical thinking.\nSee also # Wiki › Golden Age Wiki › Saṃsāra Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius External links # Apocalypse | Wikipedia Biblical Apocalypse | World History Encyclopedia From ἀποκαλύπτω (apokalúptō, “to disclose, reveal”) + -σις (-sis).

More specifically, the discipline is representative of an important body of research that is unveiling the extends to which knowledge and transmission thereof has been ever since the beginning of civilization making.","content":"Archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field of study that explores the knowledge, practices, and beliefs related to celestial bodies and phenomena in ancient cultures. It combines principles from archaeology, anthropology, and astronomy to analyze and interpret the astronomical significance of archaeological sites, artifacts, and cultural practices. By investigating the ways in which ancient civilizations observed, recorded, and utilized astronomical information, archaeoastronomy aims to enrich our understanding of their worldviews, religious beliefs, and social organization.\nOne of the central aims of archaeoastronomy is to identify and understand the astronomical alignments of ancient monuments and structures. These alignments may have been intended for calendrical purposes, such as marking the solstices, equinoxes, or other significant astronomical events. In some cases, these alignments may have had religious or ceremonial significance, reflecting the importance of celestial events in the culture\u0026rsquo;s mythologies and rituals. Notable examples of such alignments can be found in Stonehenge in England, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and Chichen Itza in Mexico.\nArchaeoastronomy also investigates the use of celestial navigation by ancient societies. Many cultures developed advanced methods for determining their position and direction by observing the stars, the sun, and the moon. The Polynesians, for example, were skilled navigators who used the stars to sail vast distances across the Pacific Ocean. Similarly, the ancient Maya developed a sophisticated calendar system based on the observation of celestial bodies, which allowed them to track time and predict astronomical events with remarkable accuracy.\nThe study of ancient astronomical knowledge and practices can provide valuable insights into the development of scientific thought, as well as the broader cultural context in which that knowledge was produced and transmitted. Astronomical observations were often closely linked to religious beliefs, as celestial events were seen as manifestations of divine power or omens of future events. This connection is evident in the elaborate mythologies and cosmologies that many cultures developed to explain the movements of celestial bodies and their influence on human affairs.\nIn recent years, archaeoastronomy has benefited from advances in technology and methodology, including remote sensing, satellite imagery, and computer modeling. These tools have allowed researchers to analyze archaeological sites and artifacts with greater precision, revealing new insights into the astronomical practices of ancient civilizations. Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, anthropologists, and astronomers has led to a more nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which astronomical knowledge was produced and used.\nAstronomical alignments # Many ancient structures, including the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, show evidence of astronomical alignments. These alignments often served as markers of celestial events or reflected the builders\u0026rsquo; understanding of the cosmos. Here, we will discuss the astronomical alignments of the Giza pyramid complex and a few other notable sites.\nGiza Pyramid Complex, Egypt # The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, the Pyramid of Menkaure, and the Great Sphinx. These monuments are believed to have been built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2580-2560 BCE. Several astronomical alignments have been identified at the site.\nCardinal directions: The Great Pyramid of Giza, built as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, is remarkably aligned to the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). Its sides are almost perfectly aligned with true north, within a margin of error of just a few arcminutes. This precision suggests that the builders had advanced knowledge of astronomy and surveying techniques.\nOrion\u0026rsquo;s Belt: The three pyramids of Giza are said to be aligned in a manner that resembles the stars of Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt in the Orion constellation. The alignment suggests that the pyramids\u0026rsquo; layout may have been intended to represent the stars in Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt, which held religious significance for the ancient Egyptians, as they associated it with the god Osiris.\nEquinoxial markers: The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is unique among the pyramids in Egypt for its subtle concavity on each of its four faces. This concavity divides each face into two slightly inclined halves, resulting in the pyramid having a total of eight sides rather than the usual four. This feature is difficult to notice from ground level and is most visible during the equinoxes when the rising or setting sun casts a shadow on the pyramid, emphasizing the concavity.\nGreat Sphinx of Giza # The Great Sphinx of Giza is a colossal statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, believed to represent Pharaoh Khafre. The lion symbolism can be linked to the astrological sign of Leo and the constellation of the same name. In ancient cultures, the lion was often associated with strength, power, and royalty. In ancient Egyptian mythology, the lion was a symbol of protection and was associated with several deities, such as Sekhmet, the goddess of war and healing, and Maahes, the lion-headed god of war.\nThe astrological Age of Leo, as mentioned earlier, is an epoch in which the vernal equinox occurs in the constellation of Leo. During this time, around 10,500 BCE, the constellation Leo would have risen just before the Sun at dawn. The symbolism of the Sphinx as a lion can be connected to this celestial event, as it represents the earthly manifestation of the celestial lion in the sky. The Sphinx, facing east, would have greeted the rising Sun, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness and embodying the power and protection of the lion.\nThe idea that the Great Sphinx of Giza could be a marker of the Age of Leo is based on the premise that the Sphinx was originally constructed to represent a lion and its alignment with the constellation Leo during a specific period known as the astrological Age of Leo.\nAstrological ages are determined by a phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes, which results from the slow wobble of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis over a cycle of approximately 25'920 years. This wobble causes the position of the vernal equinox (the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north) to slowly move westward along the ecliptic (the Sun\u0026rsquo;s apparent path across the sky). As a result, the vernal equinox shifts through the twelve constellations of the zodiac over time, spending approximately 2'160 years in each sign. The Age of Leo is believed to have occurred between 11'010 to 8'850 BCE.\nProponents of the theory that the Sphinx marks the Age of Leo argue that the monument was originally built with the body of a lion, and its face was later re-carved to resemble the Pharaoh Khafre. According to this theory, during the Age of Leo, around 10,500 BCE, the vernal equinox would have occurred in the constellation of Leo, which would have risen just before the Sun at dawn. As a result, the lion-shaped Sphinx would have faced its celestial counterpart in the sky, symbolically linking the two.\nWater erosion # The erosion patterns on the Sphinx and the Giza pyramid complex have been the subject of much debate among geologists, archaeologists, and alternative researchers. Some of the erosion patterns, particularly on the Sphinx and its surrounding enclosure, appear to be consistent with water erosion rather than the more typical wind and sand erosion seen in desert environments.\nProponents of the water erosion hypothesis argue that the vertical and undulating patterns on the Sphinx\u0026rsquo;s limestone body and the enclosure walls suggest that the monument was subjected to heavy rainfall or even flooding at some point in its history. The climatic conditions in Egypt during the Early and Middle Holocene (around 10,000 to 4,000 BCE) were wetter than they are today, with more rainfall and the presence of savannah-like ecosystems in the area. Some researchers argue that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx could be evidence of its construction during a period of greater precipitation, possibly before the emergence of the dynastic Egyptian civilization as we know it.\nStonehenge, England # Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a circle of standing stones. It was constructed in several stages between 3000 and 2000 BCE. The site has several astronomical alignments.\nSummer Solstice: One of the most famous alignments at Stonehenge occurs during the summer solstice. As the sun rises, it aligns with the Heel Stone, creating a spectacle where the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays pass through the central axis of the monument. This alignment suggests that Stonehenge may have been used as a calendar or to mark important seasonal events.\nWinter Solstice: The site is also aligned with the winter solstice sunset. The sun sets between the two tallest stones in the monument, known as the Trilithon, during the winter solstice. This alignment further supports the idea that Stonehenge had astronomical and calendrical functions.\nChichen Itza, Mexico # Chichen Itza is a Maya city in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, that thrived between 600 and 1200 CE. The site is renowned for its impressive architecture and astronomical alignments.\nEl Castillo: The step pyramid known as El Castillo or the Temple of Kukulcan is the most famous structure at Chichen Itza. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, the pyramid\u0026rsquo;s design creates a striking play of light and shadow. As the sun sets, triangular shadows form along the side of the northern stairway, giving the appearance of a serpent descending the pyramid. This phenomenon likely held religious significance for the Maya, who associated the serpent with the god Kukulcan. Angkor Wat, Cambodia # Angkor Wat, built in the early 12th century, is the largest religious monument globally and a stunning example of Khmer architecture. The temple complex was initially dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu and later converted to a Buddhist temple. The main temple\u0026rsquo;s western entrance is aligned with the spring equinox. On this day, the sun rises directly over the central tower, creating a visual spectacle. The alignment may represent the balance between light and darkness, echoing Hindu cosmological beliefs.\nTemple of Karnak, Egypt # The Karnak temple complex in Luxor, Egypt, is one of the largest religious sites in the world, dating back to around 2000 BCE. The main temple is dedicated to the god Amun-Ra. The temple\u0026rsquo;s axis aligns with the winter solstice sunrise, allowing the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays to illuminate the inner sanctum, where the statue of Amun-Ra resided. This alignment may have been designed to imbue the statue with the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy, enhancing the god\u0026rsquo;s power.\nAlternative researchers # In recent years, alternative researchers like Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock, and John Anthony West have introduced new perspectives and hypotheses in the field of archaeoastronomy and archaeology more broadly. While their work is often controversial and not always accepted by mainstream academia, it has contributed to a re-examination of certain aspects of ancient cultures, their knowledge, and their capabilities. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to note that their research is often considered \u0026ldquo;fringe\u0026rdquo; because it challenges conventional wisdom or explores topics that are not widely accepted by the academic community.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that alternative researchers like Carlson, Hancock, and West have faced skepticism and criticism from mainstream academics, who argue that their hypotheses often lack rigorous evidence or proper methodology. However, their work has undeniably generated public interest and brought attention to the field of archaeoastronomy and ancient civilizations. In some cases, their research has encouraged further investigation and has led to new discoveries or the re-evaluation of existing evidence.\nRandall Carlson # Randall Carlson is a geological and anthropological theorist known for his work on the potential impact of cosmic events, such as asteroid impacts or cometary debris, on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and human history. He has suggested that these events may have caused cataclysms that contributed to the collapse of ancient civilizations and the end of the last Ice Age. His work has inspired discussions about the role of natural disasters in shaping human history and the potential astronomical knowledge of ancient cultures.\nGraham Hancock # Graham Hancock is an author and journalist who has written extensively about ancient civilizations, proposing that there may have been a highly advanced, prehistoric civilization that was wiped out by a global cataclysm. In his book \u0026ldquo;Fingerprints of the Gods,\u0026rdquo; Hancock presents evidence for this lost civilization, including astronomical alignments and advanced knowledge of precession among ancient cultures. While many of his ideas are not accepted by mainstream archaeologists, Hancock\u0026rsquo;s work has captured the public\u0026rsquo;s imagination and has contributed to a broader interest in ancient civilizations and their astronomical knowledge.\nJohn Anthony West # John Anthony West was an independent Egyptologist who challenged the traditional dating of the Sphinx in Egypt. He argued that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx indicate that it is much older than previously believed, suggesting that it was constructed by a more ancient civilization with advanced knowledge of astronomy. West\u0026rsquo;s work has been controversial, but it has spurred further research and debate on the age of the Sphinx and the potential astronomical significance of other ancient Egyptian monuments.\nSee also # Wiki › Ancient Builders Wiki › List of megalithic sites Wiki › Precession External links # Archaeoastronomy | Wikipedia "},{"id":"44","href":"/wiki/astrobiology/","title":"Astrobiology","description":"Astrobiology, a scientific field of research that studies life in the universe. As life in the Universe hasn't conclusively been observed, astrobiology is foremost interested in under what conditions makes extraterrestrial life possible.","content":"Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary field of study that investigates the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. It combines knowledge from astronomy, biology, geology, and other sciences to understand the conditions necessary for life to exist, both on Earth and elsewhere. To research the possibility of extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists use various techniques and tools such as searching for evidence of past or present life on other planets, moons, or asteroids in our solar system, looking for signs of life on exoplanets around other stars, and studying the chemical and physical conditions necessary for life to form and survive. This research helps us to better understand our place in the universe and answer one of the most fundamental questions in science: are we alone in the universe?\nThe search of extraterrestrial life # Astrobiology, as a field of study, has been steadily growing over the past decades, driven by the increasing number of exoplanet discoveries and our ability to probe deeper into the universe. As we continue to uncover the vast array of planetary bodies within our own solar system and beyond, the potential for finding life, in some form or another, grows increasingly possible.\nNotably, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars rover missions, such as the Mars Science Laboratory mission with the Curiosity rover, have been pivotal in the search for life beyond Earth. These missions have focused on understanding whether Mars, our closest planetary neighbor, has the conditions necessary to support life, either currently or in its past. As part of this ongoing research, rovers have identified traces of water and complex organic molecules, key elements necessary for life as we understand it.\nAdditionally, the study of extremophiles, organisms on Earth that thrive in extreme conditions, broadens our understanding of what constitutes a habitable environment. Microorganisms thriving in conditions of extreme heat, cold, or toxicity, demonstrate that life can potentially exist in environments far removed from our conventional understanding of habitability. Such insights have significant implications when considering potential extraterrestrial life, given the extreme conditions often encountered on other planets and moons.\nOne of the significant developments in astrobiology is the search for exoplanets in the habitable zone (or \u0026ldquo;Goldilocks zone\u0026rdquo;) around other stars, where conditions might be \u0026ldquo;just right\u0026rdquo; for liquid water and thus life to exist. The Kepler mission, for example, has discovered a multitude of such planets, expanding the range of possible locales for extraterrestrial life.\nMethodology # The methods of astrobiology include:\nObservational astronomy: This refers to the direct observation of celestial bodies using telescopes and other detection devices. These observations can provide valuable information about the composition, temperature, and atmospheric properties of distant planets and other celestial bodies. With the aid of spectroscopy, astrobiologists can detect the presence of certain elements or compounds, such as methane or water, that might indicate the potential for life. Laboratory simulations and experiments: Astrobiologists often use laboratory experiments to simulate conditions on other planets or in outer space. This can help to determine what kind of life (if any) could survive under those conditions. For example, scientists might simulate the high-radiation environment of Mars or the high-pressure environment of a gas giant to see how certain organisms or organic compounds react. In situ measurements and sample analysis: The term \u0026ldquo;in situ\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;in place,\u0026rdquo; and in the context of astrobiology, it refers to measurements or experiments conducted directly on the celestial body of interest. For example, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars rovers perform in situ analysis of Martian soil and rocks to detect signs of past or present life. Future missions might return samples to Earth for further analysis. Theoretical modeling and computer simulations: These are used to predict what types of life might exist on other planets based on a variety of factors, including the type of star, the planet\u0026rsquo;s distance from its star, its size, its geological activity, and its atmosphere. Theoretical models also help understand how life might arise and evolve under different conditions. Analysis of meteorites and other extraterrestrial materials: The study of meteorites can provide valuable information about the early solar system and the potential for life on other planets. Some meteorites have been found to contain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, suggesting that the basic ingredients for life could be common throughout the universe. Study of Earth\u0026rsquo;s extremophiles and their potential habitability elsewhere: Extremophiles are organisms that can survive in extreme conditions, such as deep-sea vents, high-altitude lakes, or the arid Atacama Desert. By studying how these organisms survive and thrive, astrobiologists can infer what types of life might be possible on other planets with similarly extreme conditions. This research also helps define the limits of what we consider habitable environments. Each of these methods provides unique insights into the potential for life beyond Earth. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to astrobiology that combines direct observation, laboratory and field research, and theoretical modeling.\nRequirements for proof of evidence # Findings that would be considered strong indications of extraterrestrial life would include the discovery of a reliable and repeatable proof of the following conditions:\nThe existence of organic compounds, a key building block of life, beyond Earth: Organic compounds are those that contain carbon, and they form the basis of all known life. The discovery of such compounds in places other than Earth would suggest that the conditions necessary for life as we know it may exist elsewhere. This evidence could come in the form of complex organic molecules in the atmosphere or on the surface of other planets or moons, or in interstellar clouds of dust and gas.\nThe presence of liquid water, a vital requirement for life as we know it: All known organisms require liquid water to live and reproduce. The discovery of liquid water on other celestial bodies, such as the recent discoveries of liquid water under the surface of Mars or the ocean worlds of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s moon Europa and Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Enceladus, significantly boosts the chances that life could exist there.\nEvidence of metabolic activity or biogenic substances produced by living organisms: This could include the detection of gases in a planet\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere that are typically produced by biological activity, such as oxygen or methane. For example, Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere contains a high level of oxygen because of the photosynthetic activity of plants and some bacteria. Unusual concentrations or fluctuations of these gases could indicate metabolic activity. Additionally, the discovery of substances like fossil fuels or certain types of rock formations that we know are produced by life on Earth could also indicate the presence of life.\nThe detection of radio or optical signals that are indicative of intelligence: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is an ongoing scientific effort to detect signals from space that could indicate the existence of technologically advanced civilizations. These could be radio signals, optical pulses, or other types of signals that are unlikely to be produced by natural phenomena and that show signs of being artificially produced, such as patterns or sequences that suggest a coded message.\nDirect contact with extraterrestrial beings or discovery of artifacts: This would be the most definitive and compelling evidence of extraterrestrial life, but it is also the most unlikely to occur, given the vast distances between stars and the technological challenges of interstellar travel. However, should we encounter extraterrestrial beings or find artifacts clearly made by an intelligent non-human entity, whether on Earth, in our solar system, or on a distant planet, this would constitute unambiguous proof of life beyond Earth. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that while there have been numerous claims of such contact throughout history, none has been sufficiently substantiated with evidence that satisfies the scientific community.\nAccording to Carl Sagan # Carl Sagan made the following statement in his book \u0026ldquo;Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space\u0026rdquo; published in 1994.\nSince, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring–not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive\u0026hellip; If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.\nThe quote implies that space exploration and colonization is necessary for the survival of humanity in the long run. Sagan argues that the threat of impacts from space is a natural and inevitable danger that every civilization must eventually face, and becoming a spacefaring civilization is the only way to protect ourselves from this threat and ensure the survival of our species.\nAstrobiology remains a developing field, with its subject matter largely speculative until definitive proof of extraterrestrial life is found. As Carl Sagan once wrote, \u0026ldquo;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\u0026rdquo; To date, in the broad public domain, this evidence remains elusive, but the search continues.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his book The Coming of the Gods, Jean Sendy writes the following fundamental observation about astrobiology:\n\u0026ldquo;Astrophysics\u0026rdquo; is a neologism that was coined until about 1920, because until then the means of \u0026ldquo;studying tile phenomena of outer space from the standpoint of physics\u0026rdquo; were too embryonic to constitute a discipline. The word \u0026ldquo;exobiology,\u0026rdquo; which designates \u0026ldquo;the study of the phenomena of outer space from the standpoint of biology,\u0026rdquo; is a more recent neologim that appears only in the Dewest dictionaries. The domain of exobiology. however, is still nearly empty: the first hypotheses are heing fomulated, but they rest on nothing concrete. As long as we know nothing about tile evolution of life in the fest of the Galaxy, our biologists will be limited to one particular case: earthly life and evolution.\nJean Sendy provides an insightful observation on the fields of astrophysics and astrobiology (referred to as exobiology in this context). He notes that the term \u0026ldquo;astrophysics\u0026rdquo; only came into use around 1920, as the study of outer space phenomena through the lens of physics was still in its infancy.\nEven more recent, according to Sendy, is the term \u0026ldquo;exobiology,\u0026rdquo; which is the study of life in the universe from a biological perspective. This field is primarily concerned with understanding the conditions that may make life possible elsewhere, how such life might evolve, and how we might detect it.\nSendy underscores the inherent challenges of this discipline. At the time of his writing, he describes the field of exobiology as being \u0026ldquo;nearly empty,\u0026rdquo; with hypotheses only beginning to be formulated. The main challenge Sendy identifies is that our understanding of life is based solely on one example: life on Earth. Consequently, our ability to theorize about life elsewhere in the universe is limited by our understanding of earthly life and evolution.\nThis statement underscores the inherent complexity and speculative nature of astrobiology. Without concrete examples of life beyond Earth, our understanding and theories are based primarily on our knowledge of how life works here. As our ability to explore other planets and star systems improves, and as we make more detailed observations of our own planet and life, our understanding of what is possible in terms of life elsewhere in the universe will inevitably evolve and expand.\nSee also # Wiki › Drake equation External links # Astrobiology | Wikipedia Astrobiology (science) | Britannica "},{"id":"45","href":"/resources/book-of-enoch/","title":"Avesta","description":"The Avesta is the holy scripture of Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions.

Much of the original Avesta has been lost over time, with surviving manuscripts dating back to the 13th century CE, primarily in Middle Persian language.\nManuscripts and history # The history of the Avesta\u0026rsquo;s manuscripts is complex, marked by periods of turmoil and loss. The original Avestan language script was lost over time, and the surviving manuscripts are primarily in Pahlavi, the Middle Persian language. The oldest surviving copies of these texts date back to the 13th century CE, but their content is undoubtedly much older.\nThroughout history, the Avesta underwent various redactions and revisions, especially during the Sassanian Empire (224–651 CE). The Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE led to a significant decline in Zoroastrianism and the dispersal of its scriptures. Much of the Avesta was destroyed or lost, and only a fraction of the original texts survives to this day.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Western scholars began to study the Avesta more rigorously, comparing different manuscripts and translations. This period marked a revival of interest in Zoroastrian texts and helped preserve what remained of the ancient scripture.\nContents and structure # The Avesta is divided into several major parts, each serving a unique function within the Zoroastrian religious framework:\nYasna: It contains the Gathas and other liturgical texts. The Yasna\u0026rsquo;s primary purpose is for use in Zoroastrian ritual and worship.\nVisperad: This part includes supplements to the Yasna and is used during specific Zoroastrian festivals.\nVendidad: This section contains a mix of mythological lore, moral guidance, and ritual purity laws.\nYashts: These are hymns dedicated to various Zoroastrian deities and spiritual figures.\nKhordeh Avesta: This is a smaller, more concise collection of prayers used by lay followers in daily practice.\nThe structure of the Avesta reflects a combination of spiritual guidance, liturgical material, and moral law, all essential to the practice of Zoroastrianism.\nAuthorship # The Avesta\u0026rsquo;s authorship is traditionally attributed to Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), an ancient Iranian prophet whose date of existence is debated but often placed around 1000 BCE. However, the texts themselves are likely the work of many authors over several centuries. The oldest part, the Gathas, is a series of hymns believed to be composed by Zoroaster. These hymns reflect his religious and ethical teachings, forming the core philosophy of Zoroastrianism. Later sections of the Avesta were written by different generations of priests, accumulating over time to form the entire scripture.\nSee also # Wiki › List of prophets and religions Resources › Internet Sacred Text Archive External links # The Zend Avesta, Part I - James Darmesteter 1880 Translation | Internet Sacred Text Archive The Zend Avesta, Part II - James Darmesteter 1880 Translation | Internet Sacred Text Archive The Zend Avesta, Part III - James Darmesteter 1880 Translation | Internet Sacred Text Archive Avesta | Wikipedia "},{"id":"46","href":"/resources/bahaipedia/","title":"Bahaipedia","description":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Scriptures resource offers a comprehensive collection of religious texts central to the faith, including the Old Testament, New Testament, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and various study aids and proclamations.

Dating from the mid to late 3rd millennium BCE, approximately around 2400 BCE, it is a clay cylinder inscribed with a Sumerian cuneiform text. The cylinder was discovered in 1889 at the site of Nippur during excavations by the University of Pennsylvania and is currently housed in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.\nNamed after George Barton, who first published its transcription and translation in 1918, the cylinder\u0026rsquo;s composition is thought to belong to the Old Babylonian period. However, there is speculation that the text may have been written in an earlier form of cuneiform, dating back to the Akkadian Empire around 2300 BCE. This suggests that the Barton Cylinder may be a copy of an older story predating neo-Sumerian times.\nThe cylinder\u0026rsquo;s content is a creation myth that begins with a portrayal of primeval cosmic events. The text depicts a scene where heaven communicates with Earth in the sacred area of Nibru (Nippur). The myth involves key figures in Sumerian mythology, including Ninhursag, described as the older sister of the god Enlil. The myth narrates a sacred marriage between the deities An and Ninhursag, where heaven and earth meet, and hints at a sexual union between a god, possibly Enki, and Ninhursag, resulting in the birth of deities.\nGeorge Barton\u0026rsquo;s translation and analysis of the text reveal a primitive sense of religion, with a focus on gods as givers of life and vegetation. He interprets the text as containing entreaties to various gods and goddesses for protection and provision. Barton also draws parallels between concepts in the Barton Cylinder and those in the biblical Book of Genesis, such as the notion of the Tree of Life and the portrayal of Ninhursag in a role akin to a snake goddess, reminiscent of the serpent in Genesis. He further notes references to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers as holy rivers, drawing a connection to their mention in the Genesis narrative​.\nSee also # Wiki › Comparative Mythology Resources › The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature Resources › The Eridu Genesis External links # Barton, George Aaron., Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions, Yale University Press, 1918. "},{"id":"48","href":"/wiki/bible/","title":"Bible","description":"Bible, a set of ancient religious scriptures witnessing what has happened so that humanity has proof when the Truth is revealed again during the times of the Apocalypse.","content":"The Bible is an anthology of religious texts, written and assembled over many centuries, regarded as sacred in Jewish, Christian, and, to some extent, Islamic traditions. Its significance cannot be understated; it has shaped civilizations, informed legal systems, influenced literature and art, and guided the spiritual lives of billions of people worldwide. However, it isn\u0026rsquo;t a single book authored by one individual. Instead, the Bible is a complex library of texts, encompassing a wide range of literary genres - histories, prophecies, poetry, wisdom literature, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Understanding the Bible, therefore, involves recognizing this diversity and appreciating the various religious traditions that interpret it.\nOrigins and historical context # The origins of the Bible lie in the ancient Near East, in the cradle of human civilization, where writing systems first developed. The biblical texts were primarily composed in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, each reflecting the socio-cultural contexts of their time.\nThe Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh in Jewish tradition, is foundational for both Judaism and Christianity. It consists of texts written and edited between the 12th and 2nd century BCE. The Tanakh is divided into three parts: the Torah, also known as the Pentateuch or the Law, comprises the first five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy; the Nevi\u0026rsquo;im, or the Prophets; and the Ketuvim, or the Writings, including Psalms, Proverbs, Job, and others. Each of these sections presents a rich tapestry of genres, themes, and theologies, reflecting on various aspects of human existence and relationships between humanity and the divine.\nOn the other hand, the New Testament, which is significant to Christian tradition, contains texts written in the first century CE by various early Christian communities. These include the Gospels - narratives of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s life and teachings - along with letters (or Epistles) written by apostles like Paul and Peter, and the apocalyptic book of Revelation. The New Testament texts reflect the early Christian understanding of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s teachings and their implications for both individuals and communities.\nCanonization # The process of canonization - determining which texts should be considered authoritative and included in the Bible - wasn\u0026rsquo;t a straightforward or universal process. Instead, it occurred over centuries and was influenced heavily by theological, political, and societal factors. Jewish communities recognized the Tanakh as their canon by the end of the 1st century CE, while different Christian communities took until the 4th century CE to reach a consensus on the New Testament canon.\nFurthermore, the Bible varies among Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian traditions. Some Christian traditions, such as the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, include additional books known as the Deuterocanonical or Apocryphal books. These books, written during the intertestamental period, are regarded as valuable but secondary in authority to the books in the Hebrew Bible. Protestant traditions, following Martin Luther\u0026rsquo;s lead during the Reformation, reject these additional books as non-canonical.\nApocryphas # The term \u0026lsquo;Apocrypha\u0026rsquo; often refers to a collection of Jewish writings that are included in some Christian Bibles but are excluded from the Hebrew Bible. These works, also known as deuterocanonical books in some traditions, were written during the intertestamental period - the period between the writing of the last Old Testament book (approximately 400 BCE) and the first New Testament book (around 50 CE).\nIncluded in this category are books like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (also called Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, and First and Second Maccabees, among others. These books, along with some additional texts and additions to canonical books like Daniel and Esther, are recognized by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as part of their Old Testament.\nThe Protestants, following Martin Luther, tend to exclude these books from their canon, considering them useful but not authoritative. The term \u0026lsquo;Apocrypha\u0026rsquo; in Protestant usage can sometimes also include several other non-canonical Jewish and Christian writings from various periods.\nNon-Canonical Texts # Alongside the Apocrypha, there are a plethora of Jewish and Christian texts that are not included in the standard canons of scripture but have been influential in some circles or provide important insights into ancient religious thought. These include Pseudepigrapha, Gnostic texts, and several other early Christian writings.\nPseudepigrapha are Jewish texts that are attributed to biblical figures but were not included in either the canon of the Hebrew Bible or the Apocrypha. Examples include the Books of Enoch, the Jubilees, and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.\nIn early Christian tradition, there are many texts, sometimes called the New Testament Apocrypha, that were not included in the New Testament canon. These include several Gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, numerous Acts such as the Acts of Paul and Thecla, and a variety of Epistles and Apocalypses.\nGnostic texts, often found among the New Testament Apocrypha, are a diverse collection of writings that reflect the teachings of various Gnostic sects in the early Christian era. Many of these were discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt in 1945, including texts like the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip.\nList of Biblical scriptures # Here is an expanded list of Biblical scriptures categorized primarily according to their inclusion in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and then branching out to other Jewish, Christian, and related texts:\n1. Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) # Torah (Pentateuch): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy Nevi\u0026rsquo;im (Prophets): Joshua, Judges, Samuel (I \u0026amp; II), Kings (I \u0026amp; II), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi) Ketuvim (Writings): Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles (I \u0026amp; II) 2. Deuterocanonical books # These are included in the Septuagint and accepted by Catholic and Orthodox Churches, but not in the Tanakh or Protestant Bible.\nTobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah (in the Vulgate this is chapter 6 of Baruch), additions to Daniel (Prayer of Azariah, Song of the Three Holy Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon), additions to Esther, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees 3. Additional books in the Eastern Orthodox Canon # 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh, Psalm 151, 3 Maccabees, 2 Esdras, 4 Maccabees (in an appendix to the Greek Bible) Apocryphal/deuterocanonical books in the Syriac Orthodox tradition # Psalms 152–155, 2 Baruch, Letter of Baruch 4. New Testament # These books are common to all Christian canons.\nThe four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), Acts of the Apostles, 14 Pauline epistles, 7 general epistles, and Revelation. 5. Pseudepigrapha and other Jewish non-canonical texts: # Books of Enoch (1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, 3 Enoch), Jubilees, Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, The Life of Adam and Eve, The Book of Jasher, The Book of Noah, The Assumption of Moses, The Apocalypse of Moses, The Ascension of Isaiah, The Testament of Solomon, The Psalms of Solomon, The Odes of Solomon. 6. New Testament Apocrypha and other early Christian writings: # Protoevangelium of James, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, Gospel of Judas, Gospel of Mary, Gospel of Philip, Gospel of Thomas, Acts of Paul and Thecla, Shepherd of Hermas, Didache, 1 Clement, 2 Clement, Apocalypse of Peter, The Epistles of Clement, The Letters of Ignatius. 7. Ethiopian Orthodox Canon: # Contains all the deuterocanonical books found in Catholic and Orthodox canons, and also unique books like the following ones:\n1 Enoch, Jubilees, 1 Meqabyan, 2 Meqabyan, 3 Meqabyan, and others. Documentary hypothesis # One of the significant developments in the modern scholarly understanding of the Bible, particularly the Torah/Pentateuch, is the Documentary Hypothesis. This theory suggests that the first five books of the Bible aren\u0026rsquo;t the work of a single author but were composed from four distinct sources, known by their respective letters J (Yahwist), E (Elohist), D (Deuteronomist), and P (Priestly). Each of these sources is characterized by distinct literary styles, theological emphases, and historical contexts.\nThe Yahwist source (J), for example, uses the divine name Yahweh and depicts God in very anthropomorphic terms. In contrast, the Elohist source (E) refers to God as Elohim and presents God in a more transcendent way. The Deuteronomist source (D) is primarily concerned with the law and covenant, while the Priestly source (P) focuses on matters of ritual and worship.\nAlthough not all scholars agree on the details of the Documentary Hypothesis, it offers a valuable framework for understanding the Pentateuch. It highlights the Bible\u0026rsquo;s complex composition and the diverse theological perspectives present within it.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls # The Dead Sea Scrolls are an invaluable historical treasure, comprising a vast collection of Jewish documents written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Discovered between 1947 and 1956 in eleven caves near the northwestern edge of the Dead Sea, the documents offer an unprecedented insight into the life and beliefs of Jews during the Second Temple period of history (537 BC to AD 70).\nOrigins and discovery # The first of these scrolls were found by a Bedouin shepherd in the vicinity of the ancient site of Khirbet Qumran. This discovery initiated a decade-long archaeological expedition that resulted in the uncovering of thousands of fragments belonging to nearly 900 different scrolls. The texts, concealed for nearly two millennia, were preserved by the arid desert conditions, and are considered the most significant archaeological discovery of the 20th century.\nContents and importance # The collection includes a diverse array of writings: religious texts, commentaries, apocalyptic literature, sectarian documents, and even legal contracts and deeds. Most famously, the Dead Sea Scrolls encompass copies of books from the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), notably including the oldest known copies of these texts. They also contain a multitude of extrabiblical texts that shed light on the theological landscape of Judaism during this era.\nBeyond their value in verifying the accuracy of subsequent biblical copies, the Dead Sea Scrolls have illuminated the sociopolitical climate of Judea in the years leading up to the Jewish revolt against Rome in AD 66-70. They give us a window into the diverse beliefs and practices within Judaism at this time, including those of a sectarian group often associated with the scrolls, the Essenes.\nControversy and scholarship # The interpretation of the Dead Sea Scrolls is not without controversy. Debates continue over their authors (often proposed to be the Essenes), the nature of the community at Qumran, and the implications of the Scrolls\u0026rsquo; teachings on both Judaism and Christianity.\nScholars have utilized the scrolls to explore the development of the Hebrew Bible and apocalyptic literature, to understand better the context of Jesus\u0026rsquo;s teachings and the early Christian Church, and to learn more about ancient practices such as ritual purity, temple worship, and communal living.\nDespite the wealth of knowledge gleaned from these texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls continue to be carefully studied, with scholars across the world seeking to unlock their full historical, religious, and linguistic significance.\nSee also # Wiki › Apocalypse Wiki › Dhorme Bible translation Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Raëlism Wiki › Truth External links # Bible | Wikipedia Bible (sacred text) | Britannica Torah | Jewish Encyclopedia Bible | World History Encyclopedia "},{"id":"49","href":"/wiki/biglino-method/","title":"Biglino method","description":"The Biglino method is an alternative approach to interpreting the Bible, advocating for a literal understanding of its content rather than relying on figurative language or established exegesis. It seeks to reveal a different narrative by examining the text without metaphorical interpretations and emphasizing historical and cultural context.","content":"Parallels with Schliemann # Heinrich Schliemann was a 19th-century German archaeologist and businessman. He is best known for his excavations at the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae, where he claimed to have discovered the remnants of the historical cities mentioned in Greek mythology. Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s excavations and his belief in the historical accuracy of the Iliad and the Odyssey brought him both fame and controversy. Despite criticisms of his methods, Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s discoveries significantly contributed to the field of archaeology and our understanding of ancient civilizations.\nIn the book Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth by Jean Sendy, a parallel is drawn between Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s literal approach to reading the Homeric verses and his successful uncovering of the alleged ruins of Troy.\nThe hypothesis that forms the structure of this book is founded on portions of the Bible, read as Schliemann read Homer.1\nSendy contends that just as Schliemann approached the Iliad with meticulousness and attentiveness, he advocates for a similar level of rigor in interpreting the Bible. By employing a comparable methodology, Sendy suggests that a literal reading of the biblical text can yield valuable insights and discoveries. The maxim that Sendy puts forward is the \u0026ldquo;reading the Bible as Schliemann read Homer\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat Schliemann did for Homer was exactly what I have tried to do for the Biblical narrative that concerns me.\nReading the Bible as Schliemann read Homer means ignoring all the exegeses that have accumulated around it for the past two thousand years. Their avowed purpose is to seek proof of the existence of God in the Bible. To someone who reads the Bible \u0026ldquo;à la Schliemann,\u0026rdquo; on the assumption that the text is to be taken. in its most concrete sense God is as far outside the subject as the religtous beliefs of the Greeks and Trojans were to Schliemann.2\nSendy asserts that, just as Schliemann approached the works of Homer with a keen eye for the concrete and tangible aspects of the text, he himself has endeavored to adopt a similar approach in interpreting the Bible. This approach entails disregarding the accumulated exegeses and interpretations that have developed over the course of two millennia, particularly those aimed at finding proof of the existence of God within the text. By reading the Bible with a Schliemann-like mindset, one is encouraged to focus on the narrative\u0026rsquo;s most concrete sense, setting aside theological assumptions and religious beliefs. This contextualization highlights the success of Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s approach in archaeology, as he uncovered physical evidence that aligned with the mythical cities of Troy and Mycenae, which were believed to be mere legends until his discoveries. Similarly, the author implies that a similar concrete reading of the biblical narrative, unencumbered by theological preconceptions, can lead to fresh insights and a deeper understanding of the text\u0026rsquo;s original, intended meaning.\nIn a manner akin to paradigm shifts in scientific research, Mauro Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach to interpreting ancient texts parallels the transformative impact of figures like Schliemann in their respective fields. This can be likened to Galileo\u0026rsquo;s groundbreaking assertion during the Copernican Revolution, where he challenged the prevailing belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth. As with any significant breakthrough, initial reactions typically involve disbelief, staunch denial, and even ridicule. Yet, the discoverer eventually presents evidence, akin to a telescope, urging skeptics to examine the truth for themselves:\nIt always happens, it is just a matter of time. One day someone just comes along and tells you that it is not true that the Sun revolves around the Earth, that exactly the opposite is true. We can imagine the faces of the bystanders.\nAt which point the discoverer shows them a telescope and invites them to have a look for themselves. The first reaction is always the same: disbelief, harsh denial, mockery. Come on, how is that possible? Let’s be serious, no one wants to fool around here, especially not about certain things.3\nInvariably, the response follows a familiar pattern: skepticism gives way to recognition, denial yields to acceptance, and mockery transforms into serious consideration. Such is the nature of transformative discoveries that challenge established paradigms, and it is within this context that Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach aligns with the spirit of unveiling unconventional interpretations of ancient texts.\nGalileo, after all, can remind us of Ulysses. The adventure of the Homeric hero seems to be speaking directly to us even to this day. Running into unexplored territories requires a willingness to let the known islands slip out of sight, to let go of conventionally acquired knowledge.\nAnd speaking of Homer: if, for the sake of argument, your name is Heinrich Schliemann and, perchance, one day you find yourself in love with the Iliad, what could you possibly guess from that?\nThe road is certainly all uphill from there. If you believe that simple literary pages, however venerated as masterpieces, could unveil chapters of real history, the path ahead of you will be impenetrable.4\nSchliemann\u0026rsquo;s approach provides a compelling example of how a literal reading of mythological history can lead to significant breakthroughs. Inspired by his fascination with the Iliad, Schliemann embarked on a remarkable endeavor guided by the belief that the ancient literary work held kernels of historical truth. Despite the challenges and skepticism he faced, Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s unwavering conviction in the historicity of the text drove him to excavate the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae. Astonishingly, his meticulous efforts unearthed physical evidence that aligned with the mythological narratives, validating his interpretation and reshaping scholarly understanding. Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s success demonstrates the potential of adopting a literal reading approach to uncover new insights and challenge prevailing assumptions within the realm of mythological accounts.\nThe Naked Bible # The Naked Bible is a book written by the Italian journalist, playwright and screenwriter Giorgio Cattaneo and the Italian scholar Mauro Biglino, which challenges the traditional understanding of the Bible. In their book, Cattaneo writes about how Biglino argues that the texts of the Old Testament, specifically the Torah, were not divinely inspired, but rather were written by ancient scribes who recorded the history and beliefs of their society. Therein, Biglino claims that the text has been mistranslated and misinterpreted over time, and that a more accurate understanding of the Bible would reveal that it is not a divine text, but rather a historical document that reflects the cultural and political context of its authors.\nIn this book, on page 119, a method is described that outlines Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach to examining ancient scriptures and uncovering their intended meaning. The method, developed through years of scholarly work, offers a fresh perspective on interpreting the Bible by taking its content literally rather than relying on figurative language or established exegesis.\nThe Biglino method works like this: ‘pretend’ that the Bible is simply telling the truth.\nThis means that the Bible, when read literally, suddenly becomes more consistent and appears to tell a fundamentally different story than commonly suggested by established Christian institutions such as the Catholic Church. By immersing himself in the original Hebrew texts and meticulously exploring the etymology of each word, Biglino contends that the Bible should be treated as a historical document reflecting the cultural and political context of its authors, rather than a divinely inspired text. The method encourages readers to consider what the Bible actually describes in its original form, acknowledging the uncertainties resulting from the transmission and alteration of ancient texts over time.\nTo let The Naked Bible talk for itself, on page 416, the following is stated about the method:\nWhat does the text actually describe in the original Hebrew?\nA completely different story.\nBiglino opened that box. And he has never closed it. “This type of project, which I worked on for a few years, brought me into direct contact, let’s say, with the very origins, with the etymology of each individual word. Terms that, time after time, are put back into the context of the stories. Words that gave birth to a mosaic that is totally different from what is traditionally told to us.”\nHe started doing this in 2010. Then he began to publish everything he thought he was really reading in the Masoretic Hebrew codex.\n“And so I poured out my doubts, my perplexities, my questions on paper. I expressed my feelings, in describing what was coming out of it. And always with a precise method: ‘let’s pretend that it’s true.’”\nThe book is written in a way where Cattaneo explores the scholarly work of Biglino by quoting and contextualizing a series of Biglino statements. These statements are decorated with appropriate quotation marks in the various passages highlighted here. Biglino says that the main method of his scholarly work consists of \u0026ldquo;pretending\u0026rdquo; what the Bible says \u0026ldquo;is true\u0026rdquo;. The passage goes on to say:\nIn other words, “Let’s pretend” that what is written in the Bible is true.\nSo… is it true?\n“Who knows? No one can guarantee it.”\nSo, let’s pretend that it is.\n“To be clear, it is not a playful method. In my opinion, though, it is the only proper one, precisely because we cannot be sure that what is written in the Bible is true. We do not possess the original codices. We only have copies of copies of copies, continually re-worked over time.”\nThis is confirmed by the biblical scholars of the Jewish universities themselves, such as those in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\n“If there is one thing we can be sure of, it’s that the texts we have today are not the ones that were originally compiled, because every time they re-wrote them, they changed them.”\nAnd this is certainly not just a biblical anomaly or exclusive to the Old Testament.\n“Naturally, this applies to all ancient texts, not just the Bible. So where’s the problem? The Bible is the only one on which a system of religious thought has been built, thought that claims to be the bearer of absolute, unquestionable truths.”\nThis is the real anomaly, and this really is exclusive.\n“If we accept the Bible for what it is and treat it accordingly, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, there’s no problem. If, however, we want to mine out absolute truths, then I say that we should at least go and see what the text says. ‘Let’s pretend’ that what is written is true. And let’s see what comes of that.”\nThis is the fruit of the Biglino method, the result of long and patient work, offered to the readers.\n“Basically I say, ‘This text, later interpreted for other purposes by various theologies of different origins, must in fact be separated from those intentions and be simply read again, just like all other ancient sources.’”\nThe problem?\n“It arises when we want to consider the text as unique in the history of humanity because it was ‘inspired by God.’ And unfortunately (I say ‘unfortunately’ for those who believe) the Bible simply isn’t.”\nThe method involves pretending that the Bible is true and examining the original Hebrew text to understand its actual description. However, it is acknowledged that no one can guarantee the truthfulness of the Bible, as we only have copies of copies of the original codices, which have been reworked over time. This approach is not considered playful but rather the only appropriate one given the uncertainty surrounding the Bible\u0026rsquo;s accuracy. It is noted that the texts we have today are not the original ones, as they have been changed with each rewriting.\nThis phenomenon is not exclusive to the Bible but applies to all ancient texts. The anomaly lies in the fact that the Bible has been the basis for a religious system claiming to possess absolute truths. Ultimately, the Biglino method suggests treating the Bible as an ancient source separate from theological intentions and reading it like any other ancient text.\nThe method # In The Naked Bible, on page 408, we find two-step procedure that sums up the exegetical prowess of the method proposed by Biglino:\nFirst, forget, for a moment, about all traditional interpretations.\nSecond, focus on a literal reading, pure and simple, of those verses.\nThe result is often astounding. And there is no need of any magic carpets to imagine who knows what. The Old Testament speaks for itself, explicitly and transparently.\nSo, the Biglino method consists of these two steps, to set aside all traditional interpretations and to embrace a literal reading of the verses.\nIn the realm of Biglino\u0026rsquo;s translation work, an additional prerequisite, a third step, emerges, which involves reading the verses in their original language. If that proves unattainable, the recommended course is to refrain from translating ambiguous terms altogether. Biglino emphasizes this aspect on page 87, expressing his belief that certain terms should remain unaltered in order to maintain integrity, as their precise meanings remain elusive:\n“I’ve said many times in recent years that there are terms that, in my opinion, should not be translated. It’s a question of integrity, since we do not know exactly what they mean. So honesty requires leaving them just as they are written.”5\nHonesty, he asserts, necessitates preserving them in their original form. With that in mind, Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method can be distilled into a concise formulation consisting of three steps:\nObtain familiarity with the original text Disregard all preconceived traditional interpretations Embrace a literal approach to reading the verses The Biglino method, originally put forward in The Naked Bible as a two-tiered methodology and subsequently expanded with an additional assumption in here, suggests a three-step approach to interpreting the Bible: familiarize oneself with the original text, set aside preconceived traditional interpretations, and embrace a literal reading of the verses. By following these steps, the method aims to uncover new insights and challenge established understandings of the biblical text.\nStep 1: Obtain familiarity with the original text # The first step of the Biglino Method involves obtaining familiarity with the original text of the Bible. This entails engaging with the scriptures in their original languages, primarily Hebrew and Greek, in which the Old and New Testaments were respectively written. By studying the original text, one aims to gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic nuances, cultural context, and literary style employed by the ancient authors.\nWhile obtaining fluency in biblical languages may not be feasible for everyone, resources such as interlinear translations, lexicons, and commentaries can aid in developing a deeper familiarity with the original text.\nStep 2: Disregard all preconceived traditional interpretations # The second step of the Biglino Method calls for disregarding all preconceived traditional interpretations of the Bible. This involves approaching the text with a fresh perspective, free from the influence of established doctrines, religious dogmas, and inherited interpretations that may have shaped one\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the scriptures.\nBy setting aside preconceived notions, readers are encouraged to engage directly with the biblical text, allowing it to speak for itself without the filter of traditional interpretations. It enables readers to question long-held assumptions, explore different angles of interpretation, and consider alternative viewpoints that may challenge or expand their understanding of the biblical narratives.\nStep 3: Embrace a literal approach to reading the verses # The third step of the Biglino Method advocates for embracing a literal approach to reading the verses of the Bible. This step involves taking the words and phrases in the text at face value, without imposing metaphorical or allegorical interpretations upon them.\nBy adopting a literal approach, readers are encouraged to understand the words in their most straightforward and direct sense, considering them in their ordinary meaning within the given context. Rather than searching for hidden or symbolic meanings, the focus is on grasping the explicit message conveyed by the biblical authors.\nEmbracing a literal approach does not discount the presence of literary devices, poetic expressions, or the use of metaphors within the Bible. However, it calls for discerning between figurative language intended to convey a specific message and passages that are intended to be understood more literally.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino has consistently employed this method since his initial translation work of Biblical scripture from Hebrew into Italian.\nJust to be safe, Biglino declares that he adheres to a precise method. “I simply pretend that the Bible tells the truth, and when I verify that this truth is coherent.”\nEmphasizing his commitment to a rigorous approach, Biglino asserts that he adopts the stance of assuming the truthfulness of the Bible, subsequently verifying the coherence of this truth during his analysis.\nAnd is it?\n“Very often, yes, it absolutely is. Everything can be explained in the simplest of ways. It’s just a matter of asking the right questions and the Bible will always offer a reasonable answer that makes sense.”\nAccording to him, the Bible often presents itself as a reliable source of information that can be explained in straightforward terms. By approaching the text with a critical mindset and posing pertinent questions, Biglino believes that the Bible consistently provides reasonable and sensible answers. This viewpoint suggests that a careful examination of the scriptures can unveil a coherent narrative that aligns with common sense and logical reasoning.\nMauro Biglino praises the exegetical and philological accuracy of Edizioni San Paolo: “Regarding the volumes we worked on together, while I was doing my editorial work for them, the term ‘Elohim’ was left that way in Italian as well. They did not translate it as the word ‘God’.”\nMauro Biglino acknowledges the significant contribution of Edizioni San Paolo in maintaining exegetical and philological accuracy in their translation work. Notably, during their collaboration, the term \u0026ldquo;Elohim\u0026rdquo; was preserved in Italian without being translated as the word \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo; This decision reflects a commitment to retaining the original term, thereby preserving the linguistic nuances and cultural context associated with it.\nThe same thing goes for the word ‘Yahweh’. “That one also always remained ‘Yahweh’ and was not translated as ‘the Lord’ as is the case with ordinary editions of the Bible – even though translating Yahweh as ‘the Lord’ is a complete fabrication.”\nAccording to Biglino, the translation of the word \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;the Lord\u0026rdquo; in ordinary editions of the Bible is considered by him to be a complete fabrication. He asserts that the term \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; should not be translated, but rather preserved as is, without imposing an alternate designation such as \u0026ldquo;the Lord.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to Jean Sendy # Within the pages of the book \u0026ldquo;Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth,\u0026rdquo; a profound observation is made by Sendy, shedding light on the transformative nature of a literal reading of the Bible. Sendy highlights a significant linguistic aspect by pointing out that the Hebrew word Elohim, typically translated as \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; is actually in plural form.\nWhen we read the Bible in that way, we must first note that the Hebrew word Elohim, usually translated as \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; is a plural. If we read \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Celestials,\u0026rdquo; each time the plural Elohim occurs we find ourselves reading a narrative that needs no exegesis, no helpful prodding, no religious conviction, in order to be thoroughly coherent.\nThis linguistic nuance, when taken into account, leads to a striking reinterpretation. By reading \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Celestials\u0026rdquo; instead of the singular \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; each time the plural Elohim occurs, the narrative unfolds with remarkable coherence, eliminating the need for extensive exegesis, external guidance, or preconceived religious convictions.\nRead in this way, Genesis appears as an account of the arrival of perfectly concrete Celestials, physically in our image, who behaved on earth as we can imagine our own astronauts behaving on another planet in a future that is still far off but no longer belongs to the realm of science fiction.\nBy adopting a literal reading, one can perceive Genesis as a fascinating narrative recounting the arrival of tangible celestial beings who bear a striking resemblance to humans. These celestial beings are depicted as engaging with the earthly realm in a manner akin to how we envision future astronauts exploring distant planets.\nThis interpretation, in line with the Biglino Method, invites readers to consider the concrete and tangible aspects of the biblical account, imagining a scenario that lies beyond the realm of science fiction but resonates with a potential reality. Such an approach challenges traditional allegorical or metaphorical interpretations of Genesis, offering an alternative perspective that is firmly grounded in the text\u0026rsquo;s literal content.\nOur take # The Biglino method, advocating a literal approach to reading the Bible and ancient scriptures, is instrumental in distilling their original intended meaning. By taking the text at face value, free from symbolic or metaphorical interpretations imposed by traditional exegesis, readers gain a clearer understanding of the straightforward message conveyed by the ancient authors.\nWhile the literal approach is paramount for grasping the plain meaning of the text, it is important to recognize that the ancient scribes occasionally employed subtle linguistic devices and cultural references. In such cases, a nuanced reading is required to uncover the intended significance behind the words. This nuanced understanding, however, does not rely on imposing symbolic interpretations but rather relies on contextual analysis and familiarity with the historical and cultural context of the scriptures.\nThe Biglino method encourages a balanced approach, combining a literal reading with contextual awareness, to unravel the true intentions of the scribes. By adhering to the literal words while considering the broader historical and cultural backdrop, readers can appreciate the original intended meaning without distorting the text with extraneous symbolic interpretations.\nIn conclusion, the Biglino method\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on a literal approach enables a more accurate understanding of the Bible and ancient scriptures, while acknowledging the occasional need for contextual analysis to capture the nuances and intended significance of the text. This approach offers readers an opportunity to engage directly with the scriptures and uncover their intended message without relying on traditional exegesis and its symbolic interpretations.\nSee also # Wiki › Bible Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Neo-Euhemerism Wiki › Sendy\u0026#39;s conditions of coherence Read more # Resources › The Naked Bible Excerpt from Jean Sendy (1972): Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth, p. 12\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 12\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Mauro Biglino, Giorgio Cattaneo (2022): The Naked Bible: The truth about the most famous book in history, p. 6\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 7\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn the book, Biglino explains that it was of utmost importance during his translation work of the Edizioni San Paolo to preserve the original spellings of ambigous terms like Kavod, Ruach, Elohim or even Yahweh.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":"50","href":"/resources/book-of-abraham/","title":"Book of Abraham","description":"The Book of Abraham is a work that is considered scripture by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

It is believed to be an inspired translation of writings attributed to Abraham. The book was first published in 1842 and later canonized as part of the LDS Church\u0026rsquo;s Pearl of Great Price in 1880.\nThe content of the Book of Abraham includes a narrative of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s life, his travels to Canaan and Egypt, and visions he received concerning the universe, a pre-mortal existence, and the creation of the world. The book comprises five chapters, each detailing various aspects of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s life and teachings. Notably, it recounts how Abraham\u0026rsquo;s father Terah and his forefathers turned to idolatry, and how Abraham was rescued by an angel from being sacrificed by Chaldean priests.\nThe translation of the Book of Abraham began in 1835 when Joseph Smith acquired several Egyptian papyri along with mummies. Smith, along with scribes such as W. W. Phelps and Oliver Cowdery, started translating the characters or hieroglyphics from these papyri, claiming that one of the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham. The translation process and the resulting text have been subject to much discussion and analysis over the years, particularly in relation to their historical and linguistic accuracy.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the Book of Abraham has been the subject of extensive discussion within both religious and academic circles. Scholarly perspectives on the book\u0026rsquo;s origins, translation process, and historical context vary, with some questioning its credibility as an ancient text due to its reliance on the King James Bible and anachronisms related to the timing of the creation of Genesis.\nContents and structure # The Book of Abraham is structured into five chapters, each detailing various aspects of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s life and teachings. Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief overview of its contents and structure:\nChapter 1: This chapter describes Abraham\u0026rsquo;s early life in Ur of the Chaldees. It discusses the idolatrous practices of his father, Terah, and their community. The chapter also narrates an incident where Abraham was nearly sacrificed by pagan priests and his subsequent rescue by an angel.\nChapter 2: This chapter outlines God\u0026rsquo;s covenant with Abraham, including the promises of land and posterity. It also covers Abraham\u0026rsquo;s journey from Ur to Canaan, and then to Egypt.\nChapter 3: This chapter presents a vision Abraham had, where he learns about the stars and the universe. It delves into the concept of a pre-mortal existence and introduces a cosmological understanding from Abraham\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nChapter 4: This chapter is a retelling of the creation story, paralleling the biblical account found in Genesis. It describes the process of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s creation by the council of gods.\nChapter 5: Similar to Chapter 4, this chapter continues with the creation story, emphasizing the creation of life and mankind. It also discusses God\u0026rsquo;s commandments to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.\nThe Book of Mormon concludes with the promise that those who read it and ask God about its truthfulness will receive a spiritual confirmation of its truth. This unique blend of historical narrative and spiritual teachings is central to its role as a religious text in the Latter Day Saint movement.\nAbout Joseph Smith # Joseph Smith (1805-1844) was the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, most widely known for establishing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Born in Vermont, USA, Smith grew up in a family with deep religious interests but were not strongly committed to any church.\nSmith\u0026rsquo;s significant religious experiences began in his teenage years. At age 14, he claimed to have a vision, known as the First Vision, where God and Jesus Christ appeared to him. This vision, he said, led him to restore the true church of Christ. In 1827, he reported that an angel named Moroni guided him to golden plates buried in a hill near his home in New York, which he translated into the Book of Mormon, published in 1830. This book is a religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement, believed to be a record of ancient inhabitants of the Americas and their dealings with God.\nSmith\u0026rsquo;s teachings were radical for the time, including ideas about the nature of God, prophethood, and religious authority. He established the Church of Christ in 1830, which later became the LDS Church. His life was marked by controversy, including conflicts with non-Mormon neighbors, legal troubles, and internal disputes within the church.\nSmith continued to receive revelations throughout his life, leading to the establishment of new doctrines and practices, such as baptism for the dead and, controversially, plural marriage. He also oversaw the construction of temples and the organization of a theocratic government in Nauvoo, Illinois.\nIn 1844, tensions in Nauvoo led to Smith\u0026rsquo;s arrest and subsequent assassination by a mob while in jail. His death marked a significant turning point in the Latter Day Saint movement, leading to a succession crisis and the eventual formation of several denominations, with the largest being the LDS Church, which regards Smith as a prophet and seminal figure.\nAbout the Latter Day Saint movement # The Latter Day Saint movement, commonly known as Mormonism, began in the early 19th century with the revelations and teachings of Joseph Smith. Central to this movement is the belief in the Book of Mormon as a sacred scripture, alongside the Bible. The movement is characterized by its unique doctrines, including continuous revelation, the priesthood authority, and the importance of modern prophets.\nAfter Smith\u0026rsquo;s death in 1844, the movement split into several factions. The largest is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Other significant groups include the Community of Christ.\nKey practices in Mormonism include baptism, confirmation, the sacrament of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper, temple ordinances, and missionary work. The family is considered central, with a strong emphasis on morality, health (as guided by the Word of Wisdom), and education.\nMormon theology emphasizes a plan of salvation, the potential for humans to become like God, and the importance of free will. It also teaches about a pre-mortal existence and a three-degree concept of heaven.\nThroughout its history, Mormonism has faced opposition and controversy, notably for practices like plural marriage (now discontinued by the LDS Church). Despite challenges, the movement has grown significantly, with the LDS Church reporting millions of members worldwide. It continues to evolve, with recent years seeing changes in its approach to social issues, interfaith relations, and cultural practices., commonly known as Mormonism, began in the early 19th century with the revelations and teachings of Joseph Smith.

It is recognized as canonical scripture only by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and is generally considered non-canonical by other Jewish and Christian groups.\nManuscripts and history # The most extensive early manuscripts of the Book of Enoch are in Ge\u0026rsquo;ez, divided into two families by Robert Henry Charles in his 1906 edition. The older family α includes six manuscripts, closer to earlier Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek versions. The more recent family β consists of eleven edited texts. Additionally, manuscripts used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in translating deuterocanonicals from Ge\u0026rsquo;ez to Amharic are noted. The discovery of eleven Aramaic fragments in Qumran in 1948 further supports the text\u0026rsquo;s antiquity. Greek, Coptic, Latin, and Syriac versions of the text or its parts also exist, with varying degrees of completeness and correlation to the Ethiopian text.\nThe Book of Enoch is a complex, multi-authored work spanning from 200 BC to AD 160. It is a collection of Jewish apocalyptic traditions, with its oldest fragments dating to 200–150 BCE, suggesting its origins in the 3rd century BCE. This text differs from traditional Hebrew Bible materials, introducing unique concepts like Enochic Judaism and differing on views of evil, purity, and eschatology. The Qumran community\u0026rsquo;s interest in the Book of Enoch faded over time, and its relationship with the Essenes, especially regarding sections not found in Qumran, is debated. Rabbinic literature largely ignores Enoch, but it influenced Jewish mysticism and Christian doctrines.\nContents and structure # The Book of Enoch is divided into five major sections:\nThe Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 1–36): This section describes the descent of the Watchers, angels who fathered the Nephilim (giants) with human women. It includes Enoch\u0026rsquo;s journeys to heaven and the subsequent judgment upon the Watchers.\nThe Book of Parables (1 Enoch 37–71): This part contains three parables concerning a future judgment and deliverance of the righteous.\nThe Astronomical Book (1 Enoch 72–82): Also known as the Book of the Heavenly Luminaries, this section details a solar and lunar calendar and the movement of celestial bodies.\nThe Book of Dream Visions (1 Enoch 83–90): This segment recounts the history of Israel in the form of a dream that Enoch has, using animals to symbolize different human groups.\nThe Epistle of Enoch (1 Enoch 91–108): This final part includes exhortations and warnings to the righteous, prophecies of doom for the wicked, and a final apocalypse.\nCanonicity # The Book of Enoch was widely read during the Second Temple period, as evidenced by numerous copies found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Today, it is considered canonical only by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church\u0026rsquo;s Beta Israel community. The Jewish tradition, except for this group, does not accept the Book of Enoch as part of its canonical scriptures. The book\u0026rsquo;s rejection is primarily due to its inconsistencies with Torah teachings and its introduction of concepts, such as the angel Phanuel, not found in other scriptures. Additionally, its use of material from the Torah, such as midrashic interpretations, and detailed descriptions of fallen angels, contributed to its exclusion from the Hebrew canon. In Christianity, the Book of Enoch was mostly excluded from the biblical canon by the 5th century, remaining part of the scriptural tradition only in the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches.\nSee also # Wiki › List of prophets and religions Resources › Internet Sacred Text Archive External links # R H Charles 1917 Translation | Internet Sacred Text Archive Book of the Watchers (Chapters 1–36): Ge\u0026amp;rsquo;ez text and fragments in Greek, Aramaic, and Latin | Online Critical Pseudepigrapha Ethiopic text online | Tel Aviv University Library Book of Enoch | Wikipedia "},{"id":"52","href":"/resources/book-of-mormon/","title":"Book of Mormon","description":"The Book of Mormon, foundational to the Latter Day Saint movement, is a religious text published by Joseph Smith in 1830.

Some of the most famous examples of comparative mythology include the similarities between the gods of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, tales and songs in European folklore, and the myths of creation found in many cultures.\nHamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill # Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechends is considered a milestone in comparative mythology because it presents a novel approach to the study of myths and their origins. The book argues that ancient myths from cultures around the world contain encoded astronomical and scientific knowledge that has been passed down through generations. The authors propose that this knowledge was encoded in myths as a way of preserving it, despite the lack of written records in many early cultures. By comparing and decoding myths from different cultures, the authors claim that they can uncover this ancient knowledge and better understand the worldviews of ancient cultures. Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill has been influential in the field of comparative mythology and has been widely cited as an important work in the study of the interconnections between mythology and science.\nSee also # Wiki › Mytheme External links # Comparative Mythology | Wikipedia Comparative Mythology | Art \u0026amp;amp; Popular Culture Encyclopedia Mythology | World History Encyclopedia "},{"id":"55","href":"/wiki/confusion-of-tongues/","title":"Confusion of tongues","description":"Confusion of tongues, the follow-up reaction of the Elohimian civilization during the days of the construction of spacefaring technology that succeded the Great Flood in order to countervail the technological progress on Earth and render these efforts harmless. The confusion undertaking consisted of geographically disbanding the knowledge carriers all over the globe among tribes that could not understand them anymore.","content":"The Confusion of Tongues is an event described in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the story, the people referred to in the Bible were initially of one language and lived together in harmony. However, they decided to build a great tower that would reach the heavens, which is called the Tower of Babel. The Elohim saw this as a challenge to their authority and decided to confuse their language, making it impossible for them to understand each other. This caused the people to be scattered across the known world, unable to work together on their tower.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh mentions the confusion of tongues and says the following about what happened:\nThey were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.\nGo to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u0026rsquo;s speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\n— Genesis 11: 7-8.1\nSo they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.\nThis passage is referring to the story of the Tower of Babel in the book of Genesis in the Bible. The Elohim, the creators, who are observing the Earth, decide to confound the language of the people who were building space-travelling technology to reach the heavens. As a result, the people were scattered across the Earth and could no longer communicate with each other.\nThe author of the passage suggests that the creators took this action to prevent the people from becoming too powerful and to slow down their scientific progress. The creators took the Jews with the most scientific knowledge and scattered them among primitive tribes in countries where they could not be understood due to language barriers. Additionally, the creators destroyed all the scientific instruments of the Jews, further hindering their progress.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Flood Wiki › Tower of Babel Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Gemini External links # Tower of Babel › Confusion of tongues | Wikipedia Tower of Babel (mythological tower, Babylonia) Babel, Tower of. | Jewish Encyclopedia Excerpt from Raël (1973): The Book Which Tells The Truth, republished in Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers (2005), p. 22.

It transcends biological evolution, emphasizing deliberate design and continual refinement of humanoid life forms. Each successive creation represents an evolutionary step forward, although potentially posing a threat to their creators. This concept represents a blend of natural processes and conscious design in the grand progression of life across the cosmos.","content":"In Raëlism 🔯 # \u0026ldquo;Cosmic evolution,\u0026rdquo; as depicted in Raëlism, transcends the traditional understanding of evolution being a solely natural and biological process. Here, evolution also embodies the notion of an iterative and deliberate progression in the creation of intelligent life forms - a process consciously driven by these cosmic creators, from the Forerunners to the Elohim.\nThis process, as described in the quoted passage from The Book Which Tells The Truth, has seen each subsequent creation of a humanoid civilization incorporating gradual improvements, an act akin to an artist refining their technique with each new masterpiece. The creators, starting from the Forerunners, continuously honed their knowledge and techniques, enabling them to create increasingly sophisticated life forms over time.\nEach new version of \u0026lsquo;humanity\u0026rsquo; is a testament to this iterative refinement, reflecting small enhancements that contribute to a grand process of evolution across the cosmos. This \u0026lsquo;designed evolution\u0026rsquo; differs from natural evolution in its purposefulness and speed, being not a product of random mutations and natural selection over eons, but a result of deliberate design and creation.\nMoreover, this evolution is not only physical but also intellectual and cultural. The creators didn\u0026rsquo;t just aspire to perfect the physical forms of their creations, but also to imbue them with increased intelligence and the capacity for sophisticated thought. They aimed to create beings who would not only survive but also thrive, appreciate their origins, and potentially continue this lineage of creation themselves.\nHowever, this \u0026lsquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rsquo; also involves an element of risk. As creations become more advanced, they might pose a potential threat to their creators. This concern underlies the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s hesitations about humanity on Earth, which is seen as possibly being slightly superior to their fathers. Despite this, the majority of the Elohim hope that humanity will prove its worthiness of the heritage it has received.\nIn conclusion, this model of \u0026lsquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rsquo; depicts an intriguing blend of natural processes and deliberate design, highlighting the progression and potential of life not just on Earth, but across the cosmos. It presents a vision where intelligent life forms, starting from the Forerunners, have continually refined and enhanced life\u0026rsquo;s blueprint, contributing to a grand, cosmic lineage of creators and creations.\nThe mystery of abiogenesis # Traditional understanding of evolution primarily revolves around the concept of natural selection and random mutations over vast spans of time, where life forms adapt, diversify, and grow more complex due to environmental pressures. This process begins with a simple form of life, which, over billions of years, results in the vast diversity and complexity of life we observe today. However, this traditional concept of evolution doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the origin of life itself, the process known as abiogenesis.\nAbiogenesis pertains to how life arises from non-living matter, such as molecules containing carbon and other elements. It is essentially the process that \u0026ldquo;kick-starts\u0026rdquo; the evolutionary machinery. While various theories exist, the exact mechanisms and conditions under which life first originated on Earth remain unclear.\nIn contrast, the concept of Cosmic Evolution as depicted in Raëlism involves a purposeful, conscious process of life creation and refinement by advanced civilizations. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of \u0026lsquo;directed evolution\u0026rsquo;, where each successive creation represents an advancement over the previous one. But while this provides an intriguing explanation for the progression and diversity of life, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily solve the problem of abiogenesis either.\nThe issue arises from the question: How did the original creators - the Forerunners - come into existence? If they themselves were created by another civilization, who created that civilization, and so on? This leads to an infinite regress problem unless there\u0026rsquo;s a starting point - a civilization that arose spontaneously from non-living matter, essentially abiogenesis.\nThus, while Cosmic Evolution provides a novel perspective on life\u0026rsquo;s progression and the role of intelligent life forms in it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly address the underlying mystery of how life originates from non-life. This remains a fundamental question in both traditional evolutionary biology and alternative perspectives such as Raëlism.\nSee also # Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Forerunners Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Intelligent Design Wiki › Life engineering "},{"id":"57","href":"/wiki/cosmic-pluralism/","title":"Cosmic pluralism","description":"Cosmic pluralism, also simply known as the plurality of worlds, is the idea that multiple, yet unknown worlds must exist in addition to Earth where intelligent life must be present. The sheer vastness of space heavily supports this idea.","content":"Cosmic pluralism refers to the idea that it is possible for intelligent life to exist on other planets in the universe, beyond our own. The concept of extraterrestrial life and the search for it has been a topic of human fascination for thousands of years, with early civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese all imagining the existence of life on other planets.\nWith the advancement of science and technology, the search for extraterrestrial life has become a serious scientific endeavor, with many projects and initiatives dedicated to finding evidence of life elsewhere in the universe. For example, the search for exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) has been a focus of astronomy for several decades, and has resulted in the discovery of thousands of exoplanets to date.\nThe discovery of exoplanets has increased the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial life, as it has revealed the vast number of potentially habitable planets in the universe. In addition, the study of astrobiology has provided new insights into the conditions necessary for life to arise and flourish, and has revealed that life can exist in extreme environments that were previously thought to be inhospitable.\nThe idea of cosmic pluralism in this context is important because it challenges traditional views of our place in the universe and expands our understanding of the possibilities of life beyond our own planet. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and our own place in it, and would likely lead to new scientific and technological advancements.\nEpicurus # Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, did relate to the idea of cosmic pluralism in the sense that he believed in the existence of multiple worlds. Epicurus was a proponent of atomism, the idea that all matter is made up of indivisible particles called atoms. He believed that the universe was infinite and that atoms were constantly in motion, colliding and forming new things. He also believed that there were an infinite number of worlds, each with its own unique properties and characteristics.\nEpicurus saw the existence of multiple worlds as a natural consequence of the infinite size of the universe and the random motion of atoms. He believed that there were an infinite number of possibilities for the arrangement of atoms and that, as a result, there must be an infinite number of worlds.\nEpicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was motivated by his desire to address the question of why our world appeared to be so well suited for life. If there were an infinite number of worlds, he argued, it was likely that at least one of them would be hospitable to life. In this way, Epicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was a form of cosmic pluralism, in that it recognized the existence of multiple possibilities beyond our own world.\nIn conclusion, Epicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was a form of cosmic pluralism that was grounded in his atomic philosophy and was motivated by a desire to explain the apparent fine-tuning of our world for life. His ideas laid the foundation for the development of atomism and influenced later philosophers and scientists who explored the idea of multiple worlds and the nature of the universe.\nGiordano Bruno # Giordano Bruno, the Italian philosopher and astronomer, was a strong advocate of cosmic pluralism in the sense of multiple inhabited worlds. He believed that the universe was infinite and that there were an infinite number of worlds, each with its own suns, stars, and planets, and that many of these worlds were inhabited by intelligent beings.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s beliefs were a significant departure from the prevailing views of his time, which held that the Earth was the center of the universe and that there were only a limited number of celestial bodies. He rejected these views and instead argued for a heliocentric model of the universe, in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth and other planets revolved around it.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s ideas were heavily influenced by the ancient philosopher Epicurus, who also believed in the existence of multiple worlds, and by the works of the Polish astronomer Copernicus, who argued for a heliocentric model of the universe.\nIn addition to his views on multiple inhabited worlds, Bruno also believed that the universe was infinite and that there was no boundary to the extent of space. He saw the universe as a homogeneous and infinite expanse, filled with an infinite number of stars and planets, each with its own unique properties and characteristics.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s beliefs were not well received in his time and he was eventually put on trial by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy. He was eventually burned at the stake for his views, which were considered a threat to the authority of the Church.\nDespite the tragic end to his life, Bruno\u0026rsquo;s ideas had a profound impact on the scientific and philosophical community and paved the way for future scientists and philosophers to explore the concept of cosmic pluralism. His beliefs in multiple inhabited worlds, the infinity of the universe, and the heliocentric model of the universe were highly controversial in his time, but have since become widely accepted as part of our modern understanding of the universe.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to Raëlian teachings, the Elohim are believed to have created life on other planets as well, and may have communicated with humans throughout history, including in religious texts such as the Bible. Raëlism therefore places a strong emphasis on the idea of cosmic pluralism, and believes that humans should be open to the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms.\nFurthermore, Raëlism sees the creation of life on other planets as part of a larger cosmic plan that aims to bring humanity to a higher level of consciousness and enlightenment. The movement believes that humans have the potential to evolve into a new species with a greater capacity for love, wisdom, and harmony. This transformation is seen as part of a larger cosmic plan that in the context of the chain of humanaity is guided by the Elohim, who are believed to be working towards the betterment of humanity and therefore preserve the chain of life of the human species.\nAs stated in his book The Book Which Tells The Truth, Yehowah tells us that life propagates throughout the universe by civilization advanced enough to engineer and create new life on other planets:\nSince the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:\nThat which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. Ecclesiastes 3: 15.\nIn summary, Raëlism incorporates the idea of cosmic pluralism into its religious beliefs, viewing the existence of intelligent life on other planets as the very reality. This belief is central to the movement\u0026rsquo;s teachings and emphasizes the importance of being open to the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms.\nSee also # Wiki › Astrobiology Wiki › Drake equation Wiki › Infinity Wiki › Plurality of Gods External links # Cosmic pluralism | Wikipedia Pluralistic cosmologies | Britannica "},{"id":"58","href":"/wiki/council-of-eternals/","title":"Council of Eternals","description":"Council of Eternals, also Grand Council of Eternals, is a governing body admist the Elohimian civilization.

This very same governing body is referenced to in multiple religions, especially in the Biblical scriptures and has and still is intervening in Earthly affairs.","content":"Historical references # The Divine Council, sometimes also referred to as the Divine Assembly or as the Great Assembly of Heavnly Hosts or similar names, refers to a gathering of deities or gods found in different mythologies and religions. They make decisions and hold authority over the universe and human affairs. They are invoked or worshipped for their wisdom and assistance. In some traditions, they represent a pantheon of gods, while in others, they are depicted as an assembly of celestial beings surrounding a supreme deity.\nIn the Hebrew account # In the Bible, there are various accounts of Yahweh presiding over a grand assembly of Heavenly Hosts, which some interpret as instances of a Divine Council. These descriptions in the Old Testament indicate that the concept of a divine assembly was similar to those found in Mesopotamian and Canaanite cultures. However, it is important to note that the identities of the assembly members are less explicit compared to polytheistic descriptions, as Israelite writers aimed to emphasize the distinctiveness and supremacy of their Godhead, Yahweh.\nPsalm 82 presents a verse stating that God, referred to in the plural Elohim (Hebrew: אֱלֹהִ֔ים), stands in the divine assembly (Hebrew: בַּעֲדַת-אֵל, ‘ăḏaṯ-’êl)1 and judges among the gods, again referred to in the plural Elohim. The plurality of this divine assemlby is known among Biblical scholars of all walks and is source of great debates, specifically how the plural \u0026ldquo;elohim\u0026rdquo; has to be interpreted considering that monotheism is taken for granted. Some of them argue that both instances refer to Yahweh, while others suggest that the God of Israel governs over a divine assembly of other gods or angels. Different translations of this passage render it as \u0026ldquo;God stands in the congregation of the mighty to judge the heart as God\u0026rdquo; (elohim) or \u0026ldquo;in the midst of gods\u0026rdquo; (beqerev elohim). Later in the same psalm, the term plural \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo;, again actually elohim in the Hebrew source text, is used, stating \u0026ldquo;I have said, \u0026lsquo;You are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Psalm 82:6). Some versions substitute \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;godlike beings,\u0026rdquo; but the word employed is still elohim/elohiym. This passage is referenced in the New Testament in John 10:34.\nIn the Books of Kings (1 Kings 22:19), the prophet Micaiah has a vision of Yahweh seated among \u0026ldquo;the whole host of heaven\u0026rdquo;, with beings standing on His right and left. When Micaiah seeks someone to entice Ahab and a \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; (Hebrew: רוּחַ, rúakh)2 volunteers. This has been interpreted as an illustration of a divine council where the \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; is a member of said council.3\nThe initial chapters of the Book of Job describe the \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; assembling in the presence of Yahweh. The term \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; and its relation to the \u0026ldquo;multitudes of heaven\u0026rdquo; defy precise interpretation. Some view this assembly as another instance of a divine council, while others translate \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;angels,\u0026rdquo; suggesting that it does not represent a divine council since angels are creations of God and not deities.\nThe role of the divine assembly as a conceptual backdrop in Hebrew prophecy is evident in two descriptions of prophetic involvement in the heavenly council. In 1 Kings 22:19–23, Micaiah is permitted to witness the Elohim in action during a celestial decision regarding Ahab\u0026rsquo;s fate. Isaiah 6 portrays a situation where the prophet assumes the role of the messenger of the assembly, commissioned by Yahweh. These depictions underscore the significance of the conceptual background of prophetic authority.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In Raëlism, Yahweh is explicitely identified as the president of the Council of the Eternals governing the Elohim’s planet and therefore an individual of flesh and blood among the Elohimian civilization.\nAccording to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter Meeting the Ancient Prophets, Yahweh himself explains that the Council of the Eternals live in a planet dedicated for that purpose:\nIn my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.\nAmong those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.\nThere are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.\nAlongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals.4\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe passage states that there is a residence on another planet where people from Earth can live due to a scientific secret of eternity based on a single cell.

They have been associated with ufology due to the belief that some of them are created by extraterrestrial beings or advanced intelligences. These formations are seen as potential evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or communication. While some crop circles have been proven to be human-made hoaxes, the debate surrounding their origins continues within the field of ufology.","content":"Crop circles, or crop formations, refer to sizable patterns created by the flattening of crops such as wheat, barley, rapeseed (canola), rye, corn, linseed, and soy. The phenomenon is global but is most prevalent in the United Kingdom, where the majority of formations have been reported since the 1970s. While some attribute crop circles to various unexplained phenomena, others believe they are man-made. This article explores the history, characteristics, proposed explanations, and cultural impact of crop circles.\nHistory # The documented history of crop circles traces back to the 17th century, with arguably the earliest recorded instance in a woodcut from 1678 known as the \u0026ldquo;Mowing Devil.\u0026rdquo; This account describes a farmer who, refusing to pay the price demanded by a laborer to mow his field, allegedly stated that he\u0026rsquo;d rather the Devil did it. The following morning, the field was found to be perfectly mowed in a manner that no human could replicate.\nHowever, the phenomenon as we know it today started to gain widespread attention in the late 1970s in the English county of Hampshire. The circles began to appear in greater numbers, with more complex patterns forming over time. This increase led to the term \u0026ldquo;crop circle\u0026rdquo; being coined in the early 1980s.\nCharacteristics # Crop circles are defined by their intricate and precise patterns. They can range in diameter from a few meters to several hundred meters, occasionally covering areas as large as 80,000 sq. meters. While early formations were simple circles, over the decades, these designs have evolved into complex geometrical, mathematical, and symbolic formations, often displaying a high degree of symmetry.\nMany reports note that the affected crops appear to be laid flat, flowing in a consistent direction, without any visible signs of physical damage such as broken stalks, that would be expected from mechanical flattening. Instead, the stalks appear bent, typically at the base, or at the nodes.\nList of famous crop circles # Here are several notable historical accounts of phenomena akin to modern crop circles:\nThe Mowing Devil (1678): This is one of the earliest recorded instances of a crop circle-like phenomenon. In a woodcut from this year, a strange circle is seen in a field of oats after a farmer supposedly said he\u0026rsquo;d \u0026ldquo;rather pay the Devil himself\u0026rdquo; to cut his oat field than his neighbor. The accompanying text recounts that the field was found to be perfectly mowed by an unknown entity overnight.\nTully Saucer Nests (1966): In Tully, Queensland, Australia, a farmer reported seeing a flying saucer rise from a swampy area before flying away. When he went to investigate the location where he saw the saucer, he found a roughly circular area of flattened reeds and grass, which he reported to local police. The circles became known as \u0026ldquo;Tully Saucer Nests\u0026rdquo; and are one of the most famous historical instances of potential crop circles.\nWarminster \u0026ldquo;Thing\u0026rdquo; (1965): During the 1960s and 1970s, the town of Warminster in England became a hotbed of UFO sightings and strange phenomena. One such event involved an unexplained noise that was so powerful it caused buildings to shake and tiles to fall off roofs. In the fields around the town, locals found patches of flattened crops, which some have retrospectively likened to crop circles.\nLunarville 7, Saskatchewan, Canada (1973): In this case, six circular impressions over an area 32.5 meters in diameter were reported. This case also involved high radiation readings, dead plants, and sightings of two disc-shaped objects.\nThe Barbury Castle Crop Circle (1991): This crop circle appeared in Wiltshire, England, and represented a complex geometric figure that some interpreted as a pictorial representation of mathematical concepts.\nThe Julia Set Crop Circle (1996): This formation appeared near Stonehenge, England. It was remarkable for its fractal pattern based on a mathematical figure known as the Julia Set. What added to the intrigue was that it reportedly appeared in broad daylight within a span of 45 minutes, although this claim is disputed.\nThe Etchilhampton Crop Circle (1997): Appearing in Wiltshire, England, this formation stood out for its fractal patterns, which were indicative of a high degree of mathematical understanding.\nThe Milk Hill Crop Circle (2001): Located in Wiltshire, England, this is one of the most complex crop circles ever discovered. It consisted of 409 circles and spanned across a 780-foot area.\nThe Chilbolton \u0026lsquo;Arecibo message\u0026rsquo; Crop Circle (2001): This appeared in Hampshire, England. Its design resembled the binary code of the Arecibo Message sent into space in 1974, which led to speculation that it might be an extraterrestrial response.\nThe Crabwood \u0026lsquo;Alien Face\u0026rsquo; Crop Circle (2002): This intricate formation in Hampshire, England, depicted what looked like an alien face and a disk with a binary code message. The code was claimed to translate to a cryptic message about humanity and its potential for growth or destruction.\nThe Wayland\u0026rsquo;s Smithy Crop Circle (2006): A massive formation near Oxfordshire, England, this crop circle was noteworthy for its complex geometric pattern that required significant precision to create.\nThe Avebury Manor Crop Circle (2008): Located near Avebury, England, this crop circle depicted a representation of our solar system, aligning with the planets\u0026rsquo; positions on December 21, 2012, a date associated with various doomsday prophecies.\nThe West Kennett Long Barrow formation (2010): This detailed crop circle near Wiltshire, England, was said to be an intricate depiction of a lunar cycle.\nCley Hill, Warminster (2017): A large and intricate pattern emerged in the fields of Cley Hill near Warminster. The design contained a mix of geometric and organic forms, drawing significant attention for its beauty and complexity.\nAckling Dyke, Dorset (2018): A beautifully designed crop circle appeared near Ackling Dyke. The formation was comprised of a central circle surrounded by a pattern reminiscent of ancient symbols.\nYatesbury Field, Wiltshire (2019): This crop circle displayed an intricate design of a six-petal flower with an elaborate outer ring. Its symmetry and precision sparked much discussion and admiration.\nWoolstone Wells, Oxfordshire (2020): This formation featured an eye-catching geometric pattern that resembles the \u0026lsquo;flower of life\u0026rsquo; symbol from sacred geometry.\nLong Wood, Hampshire (2021): Appearing in a field near Long Wood, this crop circle was composed of an elaborate pattern of triangles and circles, which creates a three-dimensional cube effect when viewed from above.\nThe Arecibo message case # The Arecibo message is a radio message sent towards the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years away, from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in 1974. Devised by Frank Drake, with input from Carl Sagan and others, it was intended as a demonstration of human technological achievement rather than an actual attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. The message was transmitted only once via frequency modulated radio waves at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope.\nThe message # The content of the Arecibo message is formatted as a bitmap image that, if arranged into a grid of 73 rows by 23 columns, forms a pictorial representation of key facets of Earth and humanity. From top to bottom, the message contains:\nThe numbers one (1) to ten (10). The atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA. A graphic of DNA\u0026rsquo;s double helix structure. A figure of a human, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Earth. A graphic of the Solar System indicating which of the planets the message is coming from. A graphic of the Arecibo radio telescope and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish. The alleged response # In August 2001, a crop circle appeared in a field next to the Chilbolton radio telescope in Hampshire, UK, which some claimed to be a response to the Arecibo message. The formation was similar to the original Arecibo transmission but contained several distinct alterations. The claimed differences include:\nThe numbers 1 to 10 appear in the same format as the original message. Silicon was added to the list of elements important to life. The structure of the DNA was slightly different. The figure representing life from the sender\u0026rsquo;s place was not human, but a smaller being with a large head. The population was listed as much larger than that of Earth. The Solar System graphic was adjusted to indicate that the third, fourth, and fifth planets from the sun were capable of supporting life, and that the message sender was from the third, fourth, or fifth planet. The image of the telescope was replaced by a different structure, possibly representing the technology or method used to transmit the response. This crop circle and the one that appeared a year prior, featuring a humanoid face, caused a significant amount of intrigue, as it would have taken a significant amount of effort and technological know-how to create such complex designs in a field overnight.\nThird Crop Circle # The third crop circle, which appeared near the Chilbolton radio telescope in 2002, was even more intricate. The image depicted a large disc shape, which some interpreted as a close match to the transmission device shown in the previous year\u0026rsquo;s crop circle. It was speculated to represent the extraterrestrial equivalent of the Arecibo radio telescope.\nSee also # Resources › Temporary Temples Wiki › Ufology External links # Crop circle | Wikipedia "},{"id":"61","href":"/wiki/cyberparadism/","title":"Cyberparadism","description":"In the realm of internet culture, an aesthetic is a cohesive blend of visual and thematic elements that convey a distinct mood or concept. Cyberparadism is an aesthetic that envisions a harmonious integration of advanced technology with the natural world, leading to a state of prosperity and abundance. It emphasizes the transformative power of technology, the interconnectedness of communities, and the importance of collective goals such as the embetterment of the human condition through technology. The typical Cyberparadism setting can be a utopian society on Earth having overcome intercultural enmity or otherworldly tech-based pantropic frontier communities. At its core, Cyberparadism celebrates a future where technology acts as a bridge, enhancing and harmonizing with the diversity and the genetic makeup of life.","content":"Cyberparadism is a contemporary aesthetic that paints a vision of the future where technology and nature seamlessly coexist, leading to unparalleled prosperity and abundance. Rooted in the belief of the positive potential of technological advancements, this aesthetic extends beyond mere tools and machines. It envisions a reshaped societal structure where interconnected communities collaborate towards shared objectives, with environmental preservation and the enhancement of life being paramount.\nStructurally, Cyberparadism finds its lineage in the realms of Cyberprep, Post-Cyberpunk, and Solarpunk. It combines cybernetic themes with paradisiacal elements, often portraying either a utopian society or a literal paradise reminiscent of the Garden of Eden. While it shares the optimism of Cyberprep and the eco-consciousness of Solarpunk, Cyberparadism diverges by emphasizing not just the benefits of technological advancement but also how such advancements have profoundly transformed economic principles and labor dynamics. This encourages societies to pursue loftier goals in science, technology, civilization, and spirituality.\nSocietal structures within Cyberparadism mirror this aspiration. Highly interconnected small communities or dense urban pods collaborate, working towards objectives like environmental conservation or advanced scientific research. This spirit of cooperation, facilitated by the advanced technology of a post-scarcity society, is a hallmark of Cyberparadism.\nAt its core, the paradisal aspect of Cyberparadism is not merely an aesthetic choice; it\u0026rsquo;s foundational to its philosophy. It champions a future where technology not only enhances but also safeguards the natural world. This aesthetic refutes the idea that progress must come at the cost of the environment, instead championing a vision where humans and nature thrive in harmonious coexistence.\nSetting # The world of Cyberparadism is a tapestry of diverse landscapes and habitats, each echoing the aesthetic\u0026rsquo;s core principles. On Earth, the settings often depict societies that have achieved a harmonious balance between technological advancement and nature. These societies might be nestled in lush, untouched forests, or perched atop serene coastal cliffs, always ensuring minimal disruption to the environment. The architecture, while advanced, often borrows elements from the surrounding nature, creating structures that seem as if they\u0026rsquo;ve grown from the land itself.\nVenturing beyond Earth, the aesthetic paints a vision of minimalist habitats on distant planets or space frontiers. These extraterrestrial settings, while stark and alien, still carry the ethos of Cyberparadism. Advanced terraforming technologies might transform barren landscapes into thriving ecosystems, or biodomes might dot the horizons, each a self-contained oasis. Whether on Earth or another planet, the emphasis remains on creating spaces that are sustainable, efficient, and in harmony with the environment. The blend of advanced technology with organic design ensures that every setting, no matter how futuristic, feels rooted in nature and community.\nVisuals # Cyberparadism, as an aesthetic, is a visual symphony that harmoniously blends the cutting-edge sophistication of technology with the raw, unbridled beauty of nature. The visuals serve not just as a feast for the eyes but as a narrative, telling the story of a world where humanity\u0026rsquo;s technological prowess is used to enhance, rather than exploit, the natural environment.\nThe architectural designs within this aesthetic are characterized by sleek, minimalist lines, often juxtaposed against the backdrop of dense forests, cascading waterfalls, or expansive beaches. These structures, while futuristic, often incorporate organic elements, making them appear as if they are extensions of the environment rather than intrusions. The use of simple geometric shapes, such as spheres, domes, and hexagons, is prevalent. These shapes, while evoking a sense of advanced design, also mirror patterns found in nature, symbolizing the seamless integration of the built environment with the natural world.\nColor plays a pivotal role in the Cyberparadism aesthetic. A palette dominated by shades like teal, aquamarine, and aerospace orange paints a picture that is both vibrant and serene. These colors, reminiscent of the deep oceans and expansive skies, evoke feelings of wonder, exploration, and tranquility. They serve as a reminder of the world\u0026rsquo;s vastness and the endless possibilities that lie ahead.\nDepiction in media # There are a few movies that can be mentioned that each depict elements of the Cyberparadism aesthetic:\n\u0026ldquo;Jurassic World\u0026rdquo; (2015): In this movie, the theme park, which is filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs, is a prime example of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. The park represents an advanced use of technology, in this case genetic engineering, to recreate prehistoric life forms and coexist with them in a lush, tropical environment. It blends the untamed wilderness of the past with the high-tech reality of the present, making it a paradisal place despite the inherent dangers.\n\u0026ldquo;Elysium\u0026rdquo; (2013): The orbital ring-world Elysium depicts a different form of Cyberparadism. This space habitat is filled with beautiful landscapes, luxury homes, and highly advanced medical technology that can cure all diseases, representing a sort of utopia or paradise. However, the paradisal aspect is only available to the wealthy, leading to social inequality, which contradicts the egalitarian principles usually associated with Cyberparadism. Still, the aesthetic can be seen in the combination of advanced technology and an idyllic living environment.\n\u0026ldquo;Oblivion\u0026rdquo; (2013): In the beginning scenes of the movie, the protagonist lives in a high-tech tower above the clouds, with a stunning view of the earth below. This represents a form of Cyberparadism in the sense that he lives in a highly advanced dwelling, with sophisticated technology, above a desolate Earth. The harmony with nature is achieved by leaving nature thrive on its own having a habitats that are well isolated form nature and fusion energy generators deployed on top the oceans.\nOur take # The Cyberparadism aesthetic, with its emphasis on the harmonious coexistence of advanced technology and nature, resonates deeply with the core tenets of the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s working hypothesis. At the heart of both is the idea of creation, not through divine intervention, but through a profound understanding of science and genetics. This hypothesis, based on the Raëlian revelations, describes a world where life on Earth is the result of deliberate creation by extraterrestrial beings, the Elohim, who possess an advanced mastery over DNA. This mirrors the Cyberparadism vision of a future where technology, especially in the realm of genetics and cellular biology, is harnessed to create a utopia.\nThe setting of Cyberparadism, where Earth-based utopian societies thrive in harmony with nature, can be likened to the Garden of Eden or the \u0026ldquo;terrestrial paradise\u0026rdquo; referenced several times here on the Wheel of Heaven. This paradise, a laboratory where humans were created and initially lived in ease, mirrors the Cyberparadism ideal of a world where technology and nature coexist without conflict, and where humans benefit from both without exploitation.\nSee also # Wiki › Paradism External links # Cyberparadism | Offical web presence Cyberparadism | Aeshtethics Wiki Cyberparadism Manifesto | Github "},{"id":"62","href":"/resources/cyberparadism-manifesto/","title":"Cyberparadism Manifesto","description":"The Cyberparadism Manifesto, found on GitHub, outlines a vision for a future shaped by the positive potential of technology and scientific progress.

Such debates were philosophical in nature and often addressed humanity\u0026rsquo;s place in the world, reflecting a sophisticated level of abstract thought in ancient Mesopotamian societies.\nIn this particular myth, the god An creates the cattle-goddess Lahar and the grain goddess Ashnan to provide food and clothing for the Anunnaki, the deities who, according to Sumerian belief, created mankind. Lahar and Ashnan are brought to life in a \u0026ldquo;duku\u0026rdquo; or pure place. The Anunnaki furnish Lahar with a sheepfold complete with plants and herbs, symbolizing the advent of animal husbandry.

This version of the Bible is known to have kept the original Hebrew Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) intact as to the infamous name of God. Monsieur Dhorme tried to preserve the original meaning as close as possible. In his own words, he says the following about how he and his team went about to come up with a new translation for the Biblical scriptures (in French):\nLe premier souci du traducteur doit être la fidélité non seulement à la pensée, mais encore à l\u0026rsquo;expression de l\u0026rsquo;original. Sans tomber dans un mot-à-mot intolérable, il faut chercher à conserver à la phrase sa saveur et sa couleur, autant que faire se peut, sans violer les lois de la langue française. Il est difficile de trouver le juste milieu entre un littéralisme étroit et une trop large interprétation. C\u0026rsquo;est pouruoi, dans les cas où nous avons dû paraphraser un peu, nous donnons en note le sens propre des termes traduits. Lorsque le mot hëbreu doit être citë, nous avons usé du système de transcription généralement adopté et que nous employons depuis un demi-siècle. (p. IX, Préface)\n— La Bible: Ancient Testament, Tome 1 (1956) by Édouard Dhorme\nThe previous quote roughly translates to:\nThe first concern of the translator should be faithfulness not only to the original thought, but also to its expression. Without falling into an intolerable word-for-word translation, one should seek to preserve the flavor and color of the original sentence as much as possible, without violating the laws of the French language. It is difficult to find the right balance between narrow literalism and overly broad interpretation. Therefore, in cases where we had to paraphrase a bit, we give in a note the literal meaning of the translated terms. When the Hebrew word must be cited, we have used the transcription system generally adopted and which we have been using for half a century.\nThe passage is a preface to the French translation of the Old Testament of the Bible by Édouard Dhorme. In it, Dhorme emphasizes the importance of faithfulness to both the thought and the expression of the original text, while still respecting the rules of the French language. He notes the difficulty in finding the right balance between literalism and interpretation, and when necessary, provides a literal meaning of translated terms in footnotes.\nAs such, Genesis starts with the following sentence in his translation:\n« Au commencement Élohim créa les cieux et la terre. »\nIn the beginning, (the) Elohim created the heavens and the earth.\nL\u0026rsquo;Ancient Testament # Edouard Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French was considered a masterpiece of biblical scholarship for several reasons.\nFirstly, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was based on a rigorous philological and linguistic analysis of the original Hebrew text. He spent many years studying and mastering Hebrew, as well as the culture and historical context of the people who wrote the texts. This allowed him to create a translation that was faithful to the meaning and style of the original text, while also being accessible to a modern French audience.\nSecondly, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was informed by his deep knowledge of the history and archaeology of the Ancient Near East. He was one of the first scholars to use archaeological discoveries to shed light on the biblical texts, and his translations often include extensive footnotes and annotations that explain the historical and cultural context of the passages.\nFinally, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was praised for its literary qualities. He was a gifted writer and poet, and his translation captures the beauty and complexity of the original Hebrew text in a way that is often considered to be unparalleled in the field of biblical scholarship.\nOverall, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French is widely regarded as a masterpiece of biblical scholarship because of its combination of philological rigor, historical and cultural insight, and literary quality.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s biography # Édouard Dhorme (1881-1966) was a French orientalist and biblical scholar who made significant contributions to the study of the ancient Near East, particularly the history and literature of ancient Israel.\nDhorme was born on June 17, 1881, in Maisons-Alfort, a suburb of Paris, France. He was educated at the École des Langues Orientales and the École Biblique et Archéologique Française in Jerusalem. He received his doctorate in Semitic philology in 1909 from the University of Paris, where he later became a professor of Hebrew and Jewish literature.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s scholarly work focused on the study of ancient Near Eastern languages, including Hebrew, Aramaic, and Akkadian. He was particularly interested in the Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible, and his research helped to shed light on the historical and cultural context in which these texts were written.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s best-known work is his translation of the Old Testament into French, which he completed in 1956. His translation was highly regarded for its faithfulness to the original Hebrew text, as well as its literary qualities. Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was widely used by scholars and laypeople alike, and it remains an important reference work to this day.\nIn addition to his work on the Old Testament, Dhorme was a prolific author and editor of scholarly books and articles. He wrote extensively on topics such as the history of ancient Israel, the religion of the Hebrews, and the literature of the Old Testament. He also edited and translated several ancient Near Eastern texts, including the Ugaritic tablets and the Babylonian Talmud.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the study of the ancient Near East were recognized by his colleagues and peers. He was awarded the prestigious Prix Jules Huss in 1943 and was made a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1946. He also served as the director of the École Biblique et Archéologique Française in Jerusalem from 1935 to 1955.\nDhorme remained active in scholarship and teaching throughout his life, and he continued to publish important works well into his later years. He died on October 1, 1966, at the age of 85, leaving behind a rich legacy of scholarship and insight into the ancient Near East.\nToo high in knowledge # Edouard Dhorme became fascinated with the study of cuneiform alphabetic scriptures after the discovery of the unknown writing at Ras-Shamra in 1929. He began to decipher them and published a completed translation in 1931, competing with the German philologist Hans Bauer in the process. It was during this intense period of research into ancient scriptures and religious texts that Dhorme had profound reflections on his career and the meaning of his life. He decided to leave the École Biblique in Jerusalem and the religious order to have more freedom to progress in his career and work on ancient scriptures. He also confessed to his family that he could no longer teach what he no longer believed in, having climbed too high in knowledge. In his own words (translated from the French):\n[\u0026hellip;] having climbed too high in knowledge, he could no longer teach what he no longer believed in.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s sudden departure from the École Biblique in 1931 left the school in a state of confusion. A few months later, he left the religious order and was summoned to Rome by Pope Pius XI, where he was excommunicated. The details of the meeting remain unknown. Despite the excommunication, Dhorme remained attached to Catholic values and faith, and continued to attend Mass, especially towards the end of his life in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.\nIt is noteworthy that around 1930, on a boat departing from Egypt, Dhorme met a stylish and cultured widow named Mia (Maria Françoise Lepoint). It remains unclear whether this encounter influenced his decision to leave the religious order. Dhorme liked to say to his cousins, \u0026ldquo;we owe the truth only to ourselves,\u0026rdquo; without explaining what he meant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say with certainty what Dhorme meant by those words, as we can only speculate based on the information available. However, his departure from the École Biblique and the Catholic Church, as well as his continuing attachment to the values of the faith, suggest that he may have undergone a crisis of faith or a conflict between his scholarly pursuits and his religious beliefs.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s interest in the study of ancient texts and religions, as well as his passion for the decipherment of the Ras-Shamra tablets, may have led him to question certain aspects of his religious beliefs. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that he felt his scholarly pursuits were incompatible with his role as a Catholic priest and scholar, and that he was no longer able to teach what he no longer believed in.\nHis decision to leave the École Biblique and the Catholic Church, as well as his excommunication, suggest that he may have come into conflict with the church hierarchy over his scholarly work and beliefs. However, as the details of the meeting with Pope Pius XI are unknown, we cannot say for certain what transpired between them.\nBibliography # Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s first major publication was a critical edition of the Hebrew text of the Book of Job, published in 1926. He also produced numerous articles on biblical and Near Eastern studies, which were published in journals such as Revue Biblique and Melanges Syriens.\nOne of Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s most significant contributions to the field of Assyriology was his work on the Ras Shamra tablets. In 1929, he was one of the first scholars to study the tablets, which were discovered at the site of ancient Ugarit (in present-day Syria). He developed a method for deciphering the previously unknown alphabet in which the tablets were written, and his research led to a deeper understanding of the language and culture of ancient Syria.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French, published in 1935, is considered a masterpiece of biblical scholarship. His translation was praised for its accuracy, clarity, and elegant style, and it became the standard French translation of the Old Testament for many years.\nIn addition to his work in biblical studies and Assyriology, Dhorme was also a prolific writer on a variety of topics related to religion, philosophy, and literature. His books include \u0026ldquo;La Notion de Dieu chez les Semites Occidentaux,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;La Philosophie de la Religion chez les Hebreux,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rsquo;Etre et le Phenomene.\u0026rdquo;\nA list of his major works:\nLe livre de Job: traduit et commenté (1926) La religion assyro-babylonienne (1927) Les religions de Babylonie et d\u0026rsquo;Assyrie (1935) Le Cantique des cantiques: traduit et commenté (1946) La Bible: Ancien Testament, Tome 1 (1956) La Bible: Ancien Testament, Tome 2 (1958) In Raëlism 🔯 # The Dhorme Bible also happens to be the very same book that Claude Vorhilon aka Raël had with him during his purported encounter with Yahweh.\nSee also # Wiki › Bible\nExternal links # La Bible: Ancient Testament (1956), [Paris] Gallimard.

He is widely known for his work \u0026ldquo;Divine Signposts,\u0026rdquo; considered a foundational text for Ōmoto. This religion, emerging in the early 20th century, is characterized by its syncretic approach, blending Shinto, Buddhism, and elements of other religious traditions, along with a strong emphasis on world peace and the spiritual unity of humanity.\nOnisaburō\u0026rsquo;s influence on Ōmoto was profound. He transformed the group from a small religious community into a significant spiritual movement. Under his guidance, Ōmoto adopted various social reform initiatives and became involved in international peace efforts. His teachings emphasized the importance of artistic expression and the spiritual development of the individual, advocating a world free from materialism and conflict.\nHis life and work, however, were not without controversy. Onisaburō and the Ōmoto movement faced persecution from the Japanese government, primarily due to their pacifist stance and criticism of the state\u0026rsquo;s militarism. This persecution culminated in multiple government crackdowns, including the Ōmoto Incident of 1935, where Onisaburō and other leaders were arrested.\nAbout Ōmoto # Ōmoto (大本), also known as Ōmoto-kyō, is a Japanese new religious movement that originated in the late 19th century. Founded by Deguchi Nao (出口 直) in 1892, and later significantly shaped by her son-in-law, Deguchi Onisaburō (出口 王仁三郎), the movement is rooted in Shinto, the indigenous faith of Japan, but also incorporates elements from Buddhism, Christianity, and other religious and philosophical traditions. Ōmoto\u0026rsquo;s teachings emphasize the importance of world peace, spiritual enlightenment, and the artistic expression of faith.\nŌmoto\u0026rsquo;s theology centers on the belief in a supreme deity, Ushitora no Konjin, who communicates divine will through spiritual mediums. Nao began the movement after experiencing what she believed to be spiritual revelations from this deity. Onisaburō expanded on these teachings, promoting a universalist message that sought to harmonize all religions and foster world peace. He also emphasized the importance of art and culture in spiritual life, which led to the establishment of cultural institutions under the auspices of Ōmoto.\nThe movement experienced rapid growth in the early 20th century, attracting followers with its message of spiritual renewal and social reform. However, its critical stance against militarism and the Japanese government\u0026rsquo;s policies led to severe persecution, notably during the Ōmoto Incident of 1935, when government forces suppressed the movement, arresting many of its leaders including Onisaburō.\nDespite these setbacks, Ōmoto survived and continued to influence religious and cultural life in Japan. Today, it remains active, promoting its teachings on spiritual enlightenment and peace, and engaging in various cultural and educational activities. Ōmoto\u0026rsquo;s influence extends beyond its religious practices, contributing to discussions on interfaith dialogue, peacebuilding, and the role of religion in modern society. Its history reflects broader themes in Japanese religious history, including the tension between new religious movements and state authority, and the ongoing evolution of Shinto in the modern era.\nSee also # Wiki › List of prophets and religions External links # Offical Ōmoto web presence The international edition of Divine Signposts | Offical Ōmoto web presence Oomoto | Wikipedia "},{"id":"67","href":"/wiki/dragons/","title":"Dragons","description":"Dragons, an extinct class of biological life forms that originally got engineered on the Elohimian home planet that were characterized by being particularly dreadful and monstrous. As a consequence of the severity of an incident, the research and engineering got offshored to near-at-hand exoplanet, Earth, and kickstarted life upon its surface. These dragons are known to us through paleontology as dinosaurs.","content":"In mythological terms, dragons are typically depicted as large, fire-breathing, scaly creatures with wings, sharp claws, and long, serpentine tails. They are often portrayed as fearsome, powerful creatures that can bring both destruction and protection. Dragons appear in the mythologies of many cultures, including those of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and are often associated with royalty, power, and wisdom. In many mythologies, dragons are guardians of treasure and knowledge, and they are also sometimes seen as symbols of fertility and rebirth.\nDinosaurs # Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that supposedly lived on Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which spanned from about 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago. They were a diverse group of animals that ranged from the size of small birds to the largest land animals that have ever lived. Dinosaurs are known for their distinctive features such as their large size, scaly skin, and long tails, and they have captivated the public imagination for centuries. The study of dinosaurs has greatly contributed to our understanding of the history of life on Earth, and their fossilized remains have provided important insights into their biology.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, in the very first chapter, Yahweh explains how the creation of prototyipcal precursor of the dinosaurs got genetically engineered from scratch on the Elohimian home planet:\nA very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.'\nThe scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.\nSince at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live. [\u0026hellip;]\nThis narrative describes how an highly advanced civilization on their distant planet had reached a level of scientific and technical knowledge where they could create primitive forms of life such as living cells in test tubes. Their researchers began to create frightening animals, but due to fears of creating monsters that would become dangerous, the government ordered them to stop their experiments. One of the animals had even escaped and killed several people. In response, the researchers eventually decided to leave their planet and travel to Earth, where they believed the conditions were suitable to continue their work. This highly advances civilization are the Elohim, the creators of life on Earth.\nLater on, Yahweh explains how the Elohim kept tinkering on the dinosaurian blueprints and eventually engineered the dinosaurs that lived on Earth in these early days:\nLet the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.\n— Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.\nThus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as \u0026ldquo;ecology\u0026rdquo;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.\nAfter the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.\nThe contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.\nSome other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nThis excerpt describes the creation of aquatic animals, including small and large fish and seaweed, by the Elohim during the fifth day of creation. The creators aimed to establish a natural balance in the ocean to ensure that one species would not destroy another. Following the creation of aquatic life, birds were created with the pressure from artists to create stunning forms with the craziest colors. The creation of animals was part of a competition among scientists and artists to determine the most beautiful and interesting creatures, including the behavior of these animals during mating rituals. The excerpt also mentions the creation of monstrous animals, such as dragons or what is known today as dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nThis represents the 5th day of creation, during the Age of Virog, as a period of time where the Elohiman scientists and artists went on to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s aquatic animals and birds. The scientists and artists create a natural balance in the ocean ecosystem by creating plankton, small fish, seaweed, and large fish, which can feed on each other without causing harm to other species.\nThe scientists and artists organize competitions to determine the most beautiful and interesting animals, and even focus on the behavior of the animals during their mating rituals. Some groups of scientists also create monstrous animals, the dinosaurs, which prove to be a source of concern for some individuals back on their home planet who opposed the creation plans.\nThe dinosaurs are the same creatures that mythology remembers as dragons.\nOur take # Dragons are described as creatures created by the Elohim during the fifth day of creation, which are equivalent to the dinosaurs that existed during the Age of Virgo. These dragons or dinosaurs were created by the Elohim alongside other life forms, including fish and birds. Some groups of scientists and artists also created monsters, the dinosaurs.\nThe realization that dinosaurs are indeed the same as dragons is very fascinating. Let\u0026rsquo;s simply argue that dragons actually resemble dinosaurs is based on the idea that many of the descriptions of dragons in mythology share similar characteristics with the physical traits of dinosaurs. For example, many depictions of dragons in various cultures feature long necks, sharp teeth, scaly skin, and the ability to breathe fire. These are all features that are shared by certain types of dinosaurs, such as the long-necked sauropods, the sharp-toothed theropods, and the armored stegosaurs and ankylosaurs.\nFurthermore, the idea of dragons as large, powerful, and often feared creatures is also similar to how we think of dinosaurs today. The dinosaur fossils that have been found and studied over the years give us a glimpse into a world where these giant creatures once roamed the Earth, and their size and strength are impressive to us even today. In fact, the term \u0026ldquo;dinosaur\u0026rdquo; literally means \u0026ldquo;terrible lizard,\u0026rdquo; which could be seen as a reference to the fearsome reputation that dragons have in many cultures.\nAdditionally, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the ancient peoples who first told stories about dragons may have been influenced by the fossils and remains of dinosaurs that they discovered. They may not have had a complete understanding of the creatures they were seeing, and so they used their imaginations to fill in the gaps and create stories and myths about them. In this way, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the dragons of mythology were inspired by the real-life creatures that existed long before humans ever walked the Earth.\nIn conclusion, there are certainly many similarities between the two that make it easy to see how they might be seen as one and the same in the eyes of ancient peoples. The fearsome reputation of both creatures, as well as the shared physical traits they exhibit, suggest that there may be a deeper connection between them than we might think at first glance.\nSee also # Wiki › Elohimian Home Planet Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Leviathan Wiki › Serpent\nExternal links # Dinosaur | Wikipedia\n"},{"id":"68","href":"/wiki/drake-equation/","title":"Drake equation","description":"Drake equation, an equation expressing the probability of intelligent extraterrestrial life as the product of various factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable or the fraction of planets on which life might arise.

The Garden of Eden refers to an enclosed research site operated by Elohimian researchers in the Eden region.","content":"The Garden of Eden is a significant locale featured prominently in the Biblical narrative of the creation and early history of humanity. Considered a paradise by many, this garden is described in the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Bible. The Garden of Eden symbolizes a primordial utopia, filled with lush vegetation, all forms of life, and the presence of the Elohim.\nThe Garden of Eden is often equated with paradise on earth based on its depiction in religious texts, particularly the Book of Genesis in the Bible. It\u0026rsquo;s described as a place created by God specifically for Adam and Eve, the first human beings, where they lived in harmony with nature, and where scarcity, suffering, and death did not exist. It was a place of peace, abundance, and communion with the creators. Also, the Tree of Life, which granted eternal life, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil were to be found therein.\nEtymology # In Hebrew, the term for the Garden of Eden is גַּן־עֵדֶן (gan-ʿĒḏen)1, where גַּן (gan) means garden, and עֵדֶן (\u0026lsquo;éden) is a term that is a cognate of the Akkadian word 𒂊𒁲𒉡 (edinu or idīnum), which translates to desert or steppe. The Akkadian 𒂊𒁲𒉡 (idīnum) in turn was originally borrowed from the Sumerian term 𒂔 (eden), meaning plain, steppe or even open country.\nThese linguistic links suggest that the original concept of Eden might have been the name of a specific, delimited region located in a wide, open space - potentially a highly fertile plain or steppe.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # In his book The Naked Bible author Biglino provides his interpretation of the Garden of Eden:\nBiglino suggests caution: the term “Eden” indicates a rather precise geographical location, a vast region located between Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.\n“In addition to the Bible,” he explains, “the term ‘Eden’ is also found in Sumerian-Akkadian texts, where it appears as ‘E-Din’, usually translated as ‘the house of the righteous’.” And by “righteous”, the scholar specifies, they obviously meant “those of the lineage of the Commanders, meaning the biblical Elohim, who in fact correspond to the Sumerian- Akkadian Anunna or Anunnaki.”2\nBiglino posits that the term Eden refers to a distinct geographic region between Mesopotamia and the Caucasus. Drawing connections with Sumerian-Akkadian texts, he interprets \u0026ldquo;E-Din\u0026rdquo; as the \u0026ldquo;house of the righteous,\u0026rdquo; or the dwelling of biblical Elohim, equated with the Sumerian-Akkadian Anunna or Anunnaki. Biglino also points out that there are several Gans (gardens):\nTo begin with, there are many Gans in ancient books. The one pertaining to Adam and Eve, the one located in the region of Eden, was just one of several “enclosed and protected gardens” on Earth.\n“So the Bible is telling us about one of the Gans existing on the planet,” confirms Biglino, “but we can imagine the existence of several others.”\nFor example?\n“The first one was probably located in the center of Africa, or in the southernmost latitudes of the black continent, where the first genetic experiments to manufacture Homo sapiens took place.3\nBiglino expands the concept of the Garden of Eden by suggesting multiple \u0026ldquo;Gans\u0026rdquo; or gardens, enclosed and protected spaces scattered across the Earth. Biglino asserts that the biblical Eden was just one of these environments. He speculates that other Gans could have existed, possibly including one in central Africa where, according to his interpretation, early genetic experiments might have led to the creation of Homo sapiens. Finally, Biglino also identifies the Gans basically being laboratories of some kind:\n“The Gan Eden was an experimental laboratory,” Biglino summarizes. “The Elohim, the Bible tells us, produced every kind of tree that gave good edible fruit.” In that laboratory, then, they experimented with food – both vegetable and animal – to be used for their workers, that is to say, humanity, which they had “created” through genetic engineering.4\nHe interprets the biblical \u0026ldquo;Gans\u0026rdquo; or gardens, including the Garden of Eden, as experimental laboratories. He suggests that the Elohim, or biblical creators, used these locations for scientific experiments, particularly related to their magnus opus —humanity.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the The Book Which Tells The Truth, where Eden is equated with the paradise on Earth, says the following about the locality of Eden:\nThe team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.\nTheir animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth\u0026rdquo;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent.5\nIn other words, Yahweh, the one who is speaking in the passage quoted above, tells us that Eden is an antediluvian, proto-pangaean region during the that existed by the Sixth Age of Creation in the Genesis project. This region on the former Pangean continent came to what we known as the Levant after the Great Flood, or more specifically as Yahweh says himself, the land we now call Israel.\nOut of the seven creator teams, one industrious and talented team that happened to be conducting their Genesis projects within this Eden region managed to engineer outstanding life forms. Besides the supposedly impressive flora and fauna, the human type that got incepted there happened to be considered the most intelligent one.\nIn the third book, Eden is briefly mentioned again in a series of bona fide revelations:\nYahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the “serpent” to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the “Garden of Eden” where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.6\nThe Garden of Eden is conceptualized as a specifically delineated, controlled environment —akin to a laboratory— situated on the primal, antediluvian continent. Within this \u0026ldquo;fenced laboratory,\u0026rdquo; the highly skilled team of creators conducted their work, creating exceptional life forms including, most notably, the human genus.\nSee also # Wiki › Antediluvian Wiki › Pangaea Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Leo External links # Garden of Eden | Wikipedia Garden of Eden | Britannica Eden, Garden of. | Jewish Encyclopedia The Garden of Eden is also referred to as Garden of God (גַּן־יְהֹוֶה, gan-YHWH and גַן־אֱלֹהִים, gan-Elohim).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Mauro Biglino, Giorgio Cattaneo (2022): The Naked Bible: The truth about the most famous book in history, p. 102\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 103\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 115\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Raël (1973): The Book Which Tells the Truth, republished in Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers (2005), p. 15.

Ahab was a wicked king who worshiped the pagan god Baal and led the people of Israel astray. Elijah challenged Ahab and the people of Israel to repent of their idolatry and return to the worship of the Lord.\nOne of the most famous stories of Elijah is the contest on Mount Carmel, where he challenged the prophets of Baal to a public showdown. The prophets of Baal were unable to produce any fire from heaven, but Elijah prayed to God and God answered by sending fire from heaven, demonstrating his power and confirming Elijah as a true prophet of the Lord.\nElijah also performed many other miracles, such as multiplying food, healing the sick, and calling down fire from heaven. Despite facing opposition and persecution, Elijah remained steadfast in his faith and never wavered in his commitment to the Lord.\nIn addition to his miracles and powerful preaching, Elijah is also known for his ascension into heaven in a whirlwind.

However, some biblical scholars and religious traditions have taken a different approach to the use of the plural noun \u0026ldquo;Elohim.\u0026rdquo; Some have argued that it is evidence of a polytheistic belief in the ancient Near East, in which the term referred to a council of gods who were responsible for different aspects of the world.

It would also raise questions about the relationship between the various factions of the Elohim, other powerful beings and human beings. Also, the very nature of these powerful beings would be potentially impact religious beliefs, particularly if these beings would be extraterrestrial in origin. The interpretation of Elohim as a plural entity would also raise questions about the origins of humanity and our place in the universe. It could potentially lead to a significant paradigm shift in our understanding of the Bible and its teachings.\nEtymology # The word Elohim comes from the Biblical Hebrew ʾélôhím (אֱלֹהִים / אֱלוֹהִים), which is the plural form of ʾélôah (אֱלוֹהַּ).

Ilum, in turn, is derived from the Proto-Semitic *ʔil-.3 The Sumerian cuneiform script was used to write Akkadian, and ilum can be represented in cuneiform as a logogram (𒀭), syllables (𒄿𒈝), or a combination of both (𒀭𒈝).4\nThe logogram 𒀭 (DINGIR) represents an individual god,5 while as an ideogram, it represents \u0026ldquo;sky\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;heaven\u0026rdquo;.6 The Sumerian word 𒀭𒀀𒉣𒈾 (pronounced Annunaki) contains 𒀭 as ān, which means \u0026ldquo;sky\u0026rdquo;.7\nIn summary, Elohim is a cognate of the older Akkadian term ilum, which is written with the Sumerogram 𒀭, meaning \u0026ldquo;sky.\u0026rdquo; The Semitic root of the Hebrew ʾēl or the Akkadian ilum is ʾl, which is usually understood as \u0026ldquo;power.\u0026rdquo; The Sumerogram 𒀭, meaning \u0026ldquo;sky,\u0026rdquo; provides a better indication of the original root meaning before it became associated with the powerfulness of these gods that came from the sky.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # Jean Sendy, a French author who wrote on the subject of ancient astronauts, translates Elohim as the \u0026ldquo;gods from the sky\u0026rdquo; or the Celestials. He argues that the term Elohim in the Hebrew Bible refers to a group of beings that were not strictly divine, but rather a class of powerful, advanced beings from the celestial sky who interacted with humanity.\nIn the early pages of his book Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, he says the following about the plurality of the word Elohim:\nReading the Bible as Schliemann read Homer means ignoring all the exegeses that have accumulated around it for the past two thousand years. Their avowed purpose to seek proof of the existence of God in the Bible. To someone who reads the Bible \u0026ldquo;à la Schliemann\u0026rdquo;, on the assumption that the text is to be taken in its most concrete sense God is as far outside the subject as the religious beliefs of the Greeks and Trojans were to Schliemann.\nWhen we read the Bible in that way, we must first note that the Hebrew word Elohim, usually translated as \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;, is a plural. If we read \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;the Celestials\u0026rdquo;, each time the plural Elohim occurs we find ourselves reading a narrative that needs no exeges, no helpful prodding, no religious conviction, in order to be thoroughly coherent.\nVoltaire knew that a Hebrew word meaning \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; had been translated as \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;, but people who now claim intellectual kinship with Voltaire have forgotten it.\nRead in this way, Genesis appears as an account of the arrival of perfectly concrete Celestials, physically in our image, who behaved on earth as we can imagine our own astronauts behaving on another planet in a future that is still far off but no longer belongs to the realm of science fiction.\n— Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, p. 13\nThe passage argues that reading the Bible in the same way that Heinrich Schliemann read Homer means disregarding centuries of accumulated exegesis, and approaching the text in its most concrete sense. The Hebrew word Elohim, which is usually translated as \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;, is a plural word. By reading it as \u0026ldquo;the Celestials\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;, the narrative becomes coherent and does not require any religious convictions.\nA Gentleman\u0026rsquo;s Joyous Esotericism # In a seminal paper of the same title, Stefano Bigliardi fleshes out an accurate portrayal of Jean Sendy. As the notion of the alleged existence of so-called Theosites is a central key aspect of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s thought, in the seminal paper, these Theosites are introduced through the references to Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s book Les cahiers de cours de Moïse (French for Moses\u0026rsquo; course notebooks) as follows:\nThe history is that of the arrival on earth of extra-terrestrial cosmonauts, which Sendy calls Theosites (their home planet being Theos, p. 201).\nIn the same work, Bigliardi points out that Sendy also showcased a nuanced understanding of the possibility that different factions among the Theosites may be referenced to by different names:\n“Elohim” designates a specific faction of the Theosites, not all of them (p. 203).\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino is an Italian author, translator, and researcher who is known for his controversial work on the Bible. He worked for over a decade as a translator for the Catholic Church at the Vatican, where he translated ancient Hebrew and Greek texts. According to Biglino, his work as a translator has given him access to ancient, uncensored versions of the Bible, which he claims have been altered over time.\nIn his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Ideas About The Bible, he says the following about how the name of the Biblical God is a plural and can be translated as the \u0026ldquo;being from above\u0026rdquo;:\nThe concept of “space” must be considered as the foundation of everything that has to do with the divine: the Sumerian term for deities is DINGIR, which actually refers to the meaning of “celestial apparition” highlighting its brightness and shine and then recalling the lords\u0026rsquo; flying machines, which were bright and glittering. Their ideogram symbolized a star and represented a “being from above”.\nWe immediately note that this is exactly the same meaning as the biblical term ELOHÌM, “the lords from above”: term that is usually – but wrongly! – translated using the singular form to keep the concept of God\u0026rsquo;s oneness.\nLater on, in the same book, he diligently translates the early Genesis passages as follows:\nAnd the Elohìm said: let us make man with image of us and in our liking\nBut the editor of the story seems to feel the need to emphasize something that the reader must absolutely understand: there must be no doubt whatsoever because certainly this is an extraordinary event, and soon you\u0026rsquo;ll understand why.\nIn the next verse (1:27), indeed, it seems he wants to make it clear:\nAnd the Elohìm made man with his image. With image of Elohìm he made. [He] made them male and female\nIn short, the author wants to tell us that the Elohìm (Semitic plural term for the “lords from above”) made man by using their “tselèm” ( צֶלֶם). But what is tselèm (צֶלֶם)? And was this particular so important to point it out twice?\nBefore seeing the deeper meaning of this Semitic root, we note that the Bible tells us how the Elohìms took this decision and said “let\u0026rsquo;s do”, using a Hebrew verbal form that is called “cohortative mood”: a form that contains the value of an exhortation, an invitation to do, a solicitation.\nIn this “cohortative mood” we can see a kind of summary of several discussions, hypothesis and suggestions that Enki must have given to his team in order to find a solution to the problems we have listed in the previous chapter.\nThus, using the “coortative mood” Genesis says: «Come on, let\u0026rsquo;s work, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed\u0026hellip;». Moreover, the issue of the term Elohìm - plural - cannot be dismissed too easily. We who try to practice freedom of thought and do not have any monotheistic dogma to defend, can proceed with confidence to consider “The Elohìm” as a real plurality of persons.\nAncient exegetes believed that the matter cannot be underestimated, [\u0026hellip;]\nBiglino clearly encourages readers to consider the Elohìm as a real plurality of persons, rather than a singular entity and argues that the name of the Biblical God, Elohim, is a plural that can be translated as \u0026ldquo;the lords from above.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to Paul Anthony Wallis # Paul Anthony Wallis, an Australian author on the subject of re-interpreting the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, translates Elohim as the \u0026ldquo;Powerful Ones\u0026rdquo;. This translation for instance explained in his first book on the topic, called Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis Teach That the Human Race Was Created by God or Engineered by ETs, how he uses the Semitic root of the word Elohim:\nIn whichever we may conceive of them, the story invites us to recognize a power well beyond anything we are familiar with. To understate it, they are clearly different to us! For simplicity, I will stick to the root meaning of the word “elohim” and refer to these entities as the “Powerful Ones”.\nWallis, an educated Biblical scholar, started his journey of translating the Bible in a different way by recognizing and aknowledging the anomalies in the Bible, something he calls the red flags:\nWhen I read this verse in English there’s no problem. With my interlinear Bible open, the Hebrew text on one side and the Greek of the Septuagint on the other, I can’t escape a rather big question: Why is this word, elohim, which is translated as God, shaped like a plural noun? How come it’s a plural if there’s only one God?\nIn the same book mentioned before, further on, he emphasizes the importance of reading the Bible with a plurality of Gods:\nNow that you’ve eavesdropped on my notes, you’ll understand the wrestle I found myself wrestling. Everything hinged on this enigmatic and anomalous word – elohim.\nAs I continued to walk through the pages of Genesis, I could see that every time elohim and Yahweh are equated there is a kind of moral distortion that takes place and the devout reader is forced to excuse ways that appear lower than ours – not higher. I began to wonder if the apparent morality of God would lift consistently if we were to re- pluralize our understanding of elohim?\nIn another passage of the same book, he suggest to have been able to settle the argument wether or not Yahweh and Elohim can be equated, a common argument put forward against the plurality of the word Elohim, he writes the following:\nTo settle the matter beyond doubt you just need to locate the car’s unique fingerprint, the vehicle identification number, etched into the metal. That’s the smoking gun you would need to find.\nIf the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, and not similar by coincidence, then presumably Yahweh is a separate entity whose self-revelation has been interwoven with the stories of the Powerful Ones. For our smoking gun we need look no further than the book of Joshua 24:14.\nIn this passage Joshua gives a speech to persuade the people of Israel to entrust themselves to the entity who revealed himself to Moses in the desert as Yahweh. Joshua has succeeded Moses as leader following Moses’ death. He addresses the people in these words:\n“Now, therefore, follow Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and truth. Put away the elohim (the Powerful Ones) whom your ancestors served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh\u0026hellip; Today make up your minds whom you mean to serve; the Powerful Ones whom your ancestors served beyond the river, or the Powerful Ones of the Amorites in whose country you now live. But as for me and my house we will serve Yahweh.”\nThe time in Egypt speaks of the Israelites’ time enslaved within a foreign religious culture before Yahweh revealed himself to Moses.\n“On the other side of the river,” refers to the religious culture of Abraham and Sarah’s roots in Sumerian Mesopotamia. Joshua 24:2 clarifies this:\n“Since a time before memory your ancestors, right up until Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived on the other side of the river and served Powerful Ones (i.e. other (plural) elohim.)\nJoshua calls his people to reject the Egyptian and Sumerian elohim – “tear them off” is his phrase – and give all their allegiance to Yahweh.\nHere is an instance when elohim and Yahweh clearly cannot be equated. Here elohim is a plurality of Powerful Ones whom we are not to worship. They are the Sky People of Abraham’s Sumerian heritage, whose stories are told in the cuneiform tablets. Joshua calls the people in God’s name to disregard them, reject them and cut them off!\nFor me this is the smoking gun. Every point of correlation between the Sky People and the Powerful Ones in their respective storylines constitutes another digit in that vehicle identification number. Joshua’s speech unambiguously connects the two mythologies.\nWallis argues that in order to prove that the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, therefore implying that the God of the Bible is a plural and represent an extraterrestrial civilization, one must locate a smoking gun in the form of evidence, which he finds in the book of Joshua 24:14.\nWhile taking the Sumerian account as a blueprint, Wallis makes the meticulous observation that the Powerful Ones can also be called the Sky People:\nThe Sumerian word for “god” or “gods” is a glyph that indicates the sky. To get as near to the original associations as we can I will be referencing them as Sky People.\nBasically, Wallis re-interprets the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, which he translates as the “Powerful Ones.” He emphasizes the importance of reading the Bible with a plurality of Gods and argues that the plurality of the word Elohim can be settled by locating a smoking gun in the form of evidence. Wallis suggests that the evidence can be found in the book of Joshua 24:14, which unambiguously connects the two mythologies and clarifies that the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, and the God of the Bible is a plural and represents an extraterrestrial civilization.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In the first book The Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh says the following about the very meaning of Elohim, the alleged name of God in the Biblical scriptures:\nI am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences. So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:\nIn the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.\n— Genesis 1: 1.\nElohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects.\nLater on, in the same book, Yahweh emphasizes the proper translation of Elohim again:\nElohim in Hebrew literally means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim.\nIn summary, Yahweh explains that Elohim, the alleged name of God in the Bible, means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; in Hebrew and is a plural word, implying that they represent members of an civilization from another world capable of interstellar travel.\nIndividuals # In Raëlism, there are a few Elohim invididuals that are known by their names or nominal roles. The most famous ones are named in the Bible with the following denominations:\nYahweh: The president of the Council of the Eternals and main representative of the Elohimian civilization. Lucifer: Leader of a faction among the Elohim that brought the light and knowledge to the first human beings and main advocate for the continuity of the human species. Satan: Leader of a faction among the Elohim that believes nothing good can come from the humans and main antagonist of the continuity of the human species. Summary # Usage # As we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, Elohim seems to refer to an extraterrestrial civilization collectively remembered in the Biblical scriptures. Many proponents of this notion each settle for a variety of terms. In the following table, we would like to summarize what names have been used by these proponents and what they refer to by that name.\nName Meaning Proposed by Anaqiti Those who from heaven to Earth came Mauro Biglino Anunnaki (Sumerian: 𒀭𒀀𒉣𒈾) Sky People tbd Celestials People from the Sky Jean Sendy Elohim (Hebrew: אֱלֹהִים) Powerful Ones, Sky People tbd Sky People People from the Sky Jean Sendy, Paul Anthony Wallis Theosites Inhabitants from Theos Jean Sendy Our take # The term Elohim is the plural form of Eloha, which means \u0026ldquo;Celestials\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ones from the sky.\u0026rdquo; It is the name given to the Biblical gods who are believed to be a highly advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel, terraforming planets, and synthesizing life.

Enlil, a prominent god in the Sumerian pantheon, is featured as a central character in this myth.\nThe narrative begins with Nun-bar-ce-gunu, a goddess, warning her daughter Ninlil about the potential romantic advances of Enlil. Despite this warning, Enlil and Ninlil meet and conceive Suen-Acimbabbar, who is identified as the moon god. Following this event, Enlil is arrested and exiled from Nippur for being ritually impure. Despite his exile, Ninlil follows him.\nIn a series of encounters outside the city, Enlil, disguised as various characters such as the keeper of the city gate and the ferryman of the underworld, meets Ninlil. Each time they meet, Ninlil does not recognize Enlil in his disguise, and they conceive additional deities, including underworld gods Nergal and Ninazu, and Enbilulu, associated with irrigation.\nThe story highlights several themes, including the complexity of divine relationships and the creation of gods. The narrative is devoid of moral judgment regarding Enlil\u0026rsquo;s actions, focusing instead on the creation of deities and the establishment of their roles in the Sumerian pantheon.\nEnlil\u0026rsquo;s role in Sumerian mythology extends beyond this specific myth. He is also known for separating heaven (An) from earth (Ki), making the world habitable for humans. In the Sumerian flood myth, Enlil is depicted as the one who rewards the survivor of the flood with immortality.

First translated by George Aaron Barton in 1918, this tablet, measuring 6.5 by 4.5 by 1.2 inches, was part of his \u0026ldquo;Sumerian Religious Texts\u0026rdquo;. Barton noted its close agreement with an Akkadian version published earlier by Theophilus G. Pinches. Subsequent contributions to the myth\u0026rsquo;s understanding came from Edward Chiera, who restored part of Barton\u0026rsquo;s tablet, and Samuel Noah Kramer, who incorporated various CBS tablets and translations from the Nippur collection at the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul. The British Museum also houses a significant tablet (BM 38600) for this myth, with detailed studies and translations evolving over the years, leading to the latest composite text by Miguel Civil in 1989, further refined by Willem Römer and Joachim Krecher in the 1990s.\nSee also # Wiki › Comparative Mythology Resources › The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature Resources › The Eridu Genesis External links # Barton, George Aaron., Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions, Yale University Press, 1918.

The true nature and identity of the Forerunners remain largely a mystery, as they seemingly disappeared before the Elohim could physically encounter or directly learn from them. Their legacy, however, survives in the form of their vast scientific knowledge, which was preserved and could be one day passed down to humanity.","content":"In Raëlism 🔯 # In an encounter between Yahweh, the president of the Elohimian council of Eternals, and Raël, the identity of the Forerunners is revelead. The Forerunners\u0026rsquo; level of scientific advancement was so great that they managed to install a massive space station in orbit around the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet. This station housed the entirety of their knowledge, which was programmed to automatically descend to the planet in the event of their civilization\u0026rsquo;s destruction. This act demonstrates their foresight and their intent to ensure the continuity of their knowledge and legacy, regardless of their own survival.\nThough their own world presumably perished due to an unidentified catastrophe, their technological marvel and wisdom lived on, as the Elohim inherited this knowledge, using it to develop their own civilization and eventually to create life on other planets, including Earth.\nInterestingly, despite their remarkable scientific progress, the Forerunners\u0026rsquo; civilization was not found elsewhere in the known universe by the Elohim. This has led to speculation that they may have faced a calamitous event, such as their sun exploding, becoming too cold, or their planet getting too close to the sun, rendering life unsustainable. Yet, their story remains a beacon of hope and continuity for both the Elohim and, through them, humanity on Earth. Should a similar catastrophe befall the Elohim, a similar arrangement is in place to pass on their knowledge, furthering the legacy of the Forerunners.\nIn the first book of the Raëlian canon, The Book Which Tells The Truth, the first allusion is being made by Yahweh:\nWe now reach a decisive turning point in the creators’ work. They decided at that period to let humanity progress scientifically without ever intervening directly. They understood that they themselves had been created in the same way, and that by creating similar beings to themselves, they were allowing the cycle to continue.\nBut first, in order for the truth to be spread throughout the world, they decided to send a Messiah who would be able to communicate worldwide what the people of Israel were then the only ones to know. This was in preparation for the day when the original mystery would be explained in the light of scientific progress - that is to say, the revelation.\nAccording to the passage, the Elohim, after a period of direct intervention, decided to let humanity progress scientifically without their direct involvement. This decision, as per the narrative, was based on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s realization that they themselves were created in a similar manner by the Forerunners and that by creating beings similar to themselves, they were allowing this cycle of \u0026lsquo;creation, evolution, and non-interference\u0026rsquo; to continue.\nThe mention of a \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo; here refers to the figure of Jesus Christ in traditional Christian theology. However, within the Raëlian narrative, this role is slightly different. The Elohim, recognizing the need for their knowledge and the truth about humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins to be disseminated throughout the world, chose to send a messenger or \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo;. This individual, known to us as Jesus Christ, was tasked with spreading the knowledge that, at that time, only the people of Israel, the descendants of the Adamites, were privy to.\nThe passage suggests that this was a preparatory step, intended to lay the groundwork for a future time when the mystery of humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins and the role of the Elohim would be explained in the light of scientific progress, collectively known as the Truth. This suggests that the teachings of the \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo;, in this context, were meant to prepare humanity for the ultimate revelation about their cosmic origins.\nAnother allusion is made in the third book of the Raëlian canon, Let Us Welcome The Extra-Terrestrials. This time around, the recollection by Raël is at odds with the statement made by Yahweh in the first book where the pivotal moment came during the Age of Aries and not right after the Great Flood. For sake of consistency, the reference made to the Forerunners is still noteworthy as it contains interesting details:\nIt was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer’s group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the “ark”. Satan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will “self-destroy” when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.\nThis divergence from the account provided in the first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth, raises some questions about the consistency of the narrative timeline. However, it offers valuable insights into the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s understanding of their own creation and their decision-making process concerning the future of humanity.\nThe passage begins with the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s realization that they themselves were created scientifically, in a manner identical to how they created humanity. This discovery, according to the text, comes from an unmanned spaceship sent by the Forerunners, indicating the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s connection with their own creators.\nArmed with this new understanding, the Elohim made a decision not to destroy humanity. Instead, they chose to assist Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group in re-implanting preserved life forms from the \u0026ldquo;ark\u0026rdquo;. This action and decision seem to illustrate a shift in the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s approach towards humanity. It also shows the existence of different perspectives within the council of the Eternals, with Yahweh and his majority group believing in humanity\u0026rsquo;s potential, while Satan, who plays out the role of a prosecutor of an oppositional party, remains skeptical.\nThe final part of the passage touches upon the destructive potential of scientific progress. Yahweh, interpreting the message from the unmanned spaceship, grasps that if humans turn violent, they could self-destruct upon discovering energies that elevate them to an interplanetary level of civilization. This understanding may hint at the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s reasons for adopting a non-interventionist stance, allowing humanity to navigate its own scientific advancement and moral evolution.\nReligion of the Elohim # The concept of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; within the Elohimian civilization, as described in Raëlism, diverges significantly from the traditional definitions found in many earthly religions. Rather than adherence to an alleged divine entity or a specific set of dogmatic principles, the Elohimian conception of religion is centered around the idea of \u0026ldquo;human genius.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Forerunners, the creators of the Elohim, are highly revered in the Elohimian civilization. The Elohim uphold their memory and deeply appreciate the knowledge and skills the Forerunners used to create them - the epitome of the \u0026ldquo;human genius.\u0026rdquo; This reverence forms the crux of the Elohimian religion: a collective relationship centered on the genius of their creators where the capacity for genius was passed down onto the Elohim themselves.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; in this context doesn\u0026rsquo;t restrict itself to humanity on Earth. Rather, it encompasses a broader and shared characteristic among different intelligent life forms across the cosmos - from the Forerunners to the Elohim and us humans on Earth. It implies a universal attribute inherent to these civilizations, denoting their capacity to manipulate, understand, and create life.\nTo the Elohim, the veneration of this \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; represents their principal form of worship. It\u0026rsquo;s not about worshipping an omniscient, omnipresent deity or a pantheon of god-like beings such as their own creators, the Forerunners. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s the profound respect and admiration for the abilities of intelligent life forms that have attained a level of knowledge and skill high enough to create new life forms. This form of worship could be considered a celebration of achievement, potential, and the limitless possibilities that knowledge and understanding can unlock.\nIn the Elohimian context, \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t refer to exceptional intellectual or creative power of individual humans on Earth. Instead, it signifies the capacity for intelligent life forms, such as the Elohim or their creators - the Forerunners, and perhaps one day the humans from Earth, to manipulate and understand the very fabric of life itself. This understanding extends to the ability to create life, as demonstrated by the Forerunners who created the Elohim, and the Elohim, in turn, creating human life on Earth.\nInterstellar lineage # The narrative that unfolds describes a lineage of creation that can be likened to a \u0026ldquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rdquo;, where intelligent life forms are not only evolving naturally but are actively being designed and propagated by previous generations of creators. This lineage spans across vast cosmic distances and includes different planetary civilizations.\nAt the apex of this cosmic lineage are the Forerunners, the enigmatic and highly advanced civilization that created the Elohim. The Forerunners demonstrated an incredible degree of scientific sophistication, mastering the art of life creation - a testament to their \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo;. The Forerunners were not just the product of evolution, but also the conscious designers of life, marking the first known point in this lineage of cosmic creation.\nFollowing the Forerunners are the Elohim, a civilization engineered by the genius of the Forerunners. Despite the absence of their creators, the Elohim inherited the profound knowledge of life manipulation and became creators in their own right. In this sense, they represent the next step in this cosmic evolution, carrying forward the legacy of their creators and demonstrating the same capability to engineer life.\nThis cosmic lineage extends to humanity on Earth, another creation of the Elohim using the knowledge inherited from the Forerunners. This places humanity as a part of this cosmic chain of life creation, suggesting that humans, too, could one day attain the level of scientific understanding necessary to create life.\nEach stage of this cosmic evolution involves inhabiting and adapting to new planetary environments, in a sense, conquering new worlds. This progression is pantropic in nature, as each new civilization is not just adapting to different environments but is also, thanks to the technology left behind by previous generations, able to shape these environments to better suit their needs.\nThis cosmic lineage, as outlined by Raëlism, presents a remarkable vision of life\u0026rsquo;s potential - a vision where the torch of \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; passes from one civilization to the next, each inheriting and adding to the knowledge of the previous, in an endless journey of cosmic exploration and creation.\nAd infinitum # The narrative becomes even more intriguing when we consider the possibility that the Forerunners themselves might not be the original link in this cosmic lineage. If the Elohim were created by the Forerunners, and humans by the Elohim, it stands to reason that the Forerunners might also have been created by a preceding civilization - an even more ancient and advanced species that mastered the science of life creation before them.\nThis hypothetical civilization, which we could term the \u0026ldquo;Precursors,\u0026rdquo; would represent another layer of depth to this cosmic evolution. It would mean that the Forerunners were themselves recipients of a heritage of scientific knowledge and life-creating capacity, much as the Elohim and humans are.\nThis possibility further emphasizes the concept of an unending chain of creation and exploration, each civilization passing on the torch of \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; to the next. It expands the cosmic lineage into a potentially infinite regress of creators and creations, each taking its place in a grand cosmic evolution, spanning across vast eons and countless worlds.\nSee also # Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Intelligent Design Wiki › Life engineering "},{"id":"81","href":"/wiki/four-levels-of-consideration/","title":"Four levels of consideration","description":"The four levels of consideration, derived from Raëlian theology and philosophy, propose a moral compass that requires consideration of four specific perspectives: the infinity of space, our creators - the Elohim, the human society we inhabit, and ourselves as individuals, in that order. This perspective echoes the hallmarks of classical existentialism, with its focus on individual freedom, authenticity, and responsibility. However, it transcends these concepts to formulate a unique form of cosmic existentialism, thereby integrating an awareness of humanity's position within the vast cosmos into our philosophical discourse.","content":"The four levels # The philosophy put forward by Raëlism, a new religious movement that goes back to founder Claude Vorhilon, widely known as Raël, is profoundly marked by its interpretation of humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins and destiny. In the second book of the Raëlian canon titled \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet\u0026rdquo;, Raël, through the alleged revelations by Yahweh, elucidates the ethical guidelines for individuals who seek enlightenment within the confines of this movement, creating a moral compass through purported revelations from Yahweh.\nRaël provides a detailed exploration of these principles in the third chapter, \u0026ldquo;The Keys\u0026rdquo;, specifically in the subchapter \u0026ldquo;Humanity\u0026rdquo; of his second book, \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet\u0026rdquo;:\nIn every situation, we must always consider things in regard to four levels:\nIn relation to infinity; In relation to the Elohim, our parents and creators; In relation to human society; And finally, in relation to the individual. The most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged - but always with one constant factor: love. This means taking others into account, who must be given love, because we must live in harmony with infinity, and to do this we must live in harmony with others, because they are a part of infinity as well.\nThen we must take into account the advice given by our creators, the Elohim, and act in such a way that human society listens to the advice of those who created it.\nThen we must take into account society, which makes it possible for individuals to blossom on the path of truth. But although society must be taken into account, it should not be followed; on the contrary, society must be helped to emerge from its primitive straitjacket by regular questioning of all its habits and traditions, even if these are supported by laws that are only there to try and imprison our minds in shackles of obscurantism.\nFinally, we must take into account the fulfillment of the individual. Without this the mind does not reach its full potential, and it is impossible to harmonize yourself with infinity and become a new man if you are not fulfilled.\nIn this passage, Raël lays out the core tenets of his philosophy. Firstly, he establishes infinity as the most critical level of consideration, suggesting that all things must be judged in its context and always with the factor of love. Secondly, he highlights the importance of adhering to the advice of the Elohim, our creators. Thirdly, Raël emphasizes the need to continually question societal norms, traditions, and laws to avoid mental confinement and encourage truth-seeking. Lastly, he asserts the importance of individual fulfillment, stating that without it, one cannot truly harmonize with infinity or achieve their full potential.\nThese guidelines, simply termed the \u0026ldquo;Four Levels of Consideration\u0026rdquo;1, represent unique perspectives that humans is encouraged to incorporate into all aspects of their lives. Each level corresponds to a realm of existence, spanning from the vastness of space, understood to be infinity itself, down to the individual being. In descending order, these four levels are the following ones:\nInfinity: The first level of consideration encourages one to maintain an expansive perspective by continuously reflecting on the notion of infinity. As he states, \u0026ldquo;the most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged\u0026rdquo;. In this context, the universe\u0026rsquo;s limitless nature should be used as a yardstick to gauge actions and decisions. This infinite orientation underscores the idea that individuals are part of a broader cosmic fabric that surpasses human comprehension. It promotes an altruistic ethos, urging individuals to consider others as integral parts of the infinite tapestry of existence.\nOur creators (Elohim): A core tenet of the Raëlian belief system are the Elohim, the extraterrestrial beings who they believe have created life on Earth, in particular humanity and were mistaken for Gods and still are remembered as such. They consider these entities as their spiritual parents, worthy of reverence and emulation. According to this level, one should always take into account the advice of these creators, acting in a way that human society listens and follows their guidance.\nHuman society: Within this framework of thought, society is considered both an enabler and an inhibitor of technological, but also spiritual development. While it can provide a conducive environment for the realization of truth, it is believed society often stifles spiritual progress. Consequently, the third level of consideration encourages one to challenge societal norms, laws, and traditions, seeing these elements as potential shackles imprisoning human minds in obscurantism.\nIndividual: Finally, the fourth and last level of consideration emphasizes the importance of personal fulfillment, which is perceived as an essential prerequisite to achieving alignment with infinity and subsequently transforming into an evolved being. Without self-fulfillment, one cannot achieve harmony with the infinite and fully realize one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual potential.\nThese levels of consideration encourage a complex interplay of introspection, reverence for the divine, societal questioning, and pursuit of personal fulfillment. The implications are manifold. In a world marked by fragmentation and division, the first perspective advocates a broader perspective, promoting unity and empathy. The second perspective brings a sense of spirituality and reverence, creating a moral compass guided by the wisdom of the Elohim. The third perspective fosters critical thinking and resistance to blind conformity, thereby cultivating societal evolution. Lastly, the principle of individual fulfillment emphasizes personal growth, pushing for the development of an enlightened, self-actualized individual.\nCosmic existentialism # The Raëlian philosophy\u0026rsquo;s Four Levels of Consideration can be viewed as central components of a novel branch in modern philosophical discourse: Cosmic Existentialism.\nGrounded in classical existentialist principles of individual freedom, authenticity, and responsibility, Cosmic Existentialism extends these ideas into a cosmic realm, imbuing philosophical reflection with a metaphysical awareness of humanity\u0026rsquo;s position within the cosmos and our connection to infinity. This perspective is reflected in the Raëlian first level of consideration about infinity itself, which promotes a cosmic consciousness, and the last level of consideration, the one of the individual, which underscores personal development within this vast cosmic framework.\nRelationship with Cosmicism # Cosmicism is a term largely associated with the work of H.P. Lovecraft, an American writer of weird and horror fiction. Lovecraft\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of cosmicism expresses the insignificance of human endeavors in the grand scheme of the universe. According to cosmicism, human beings are an unimportant part of an uncaring cosmos that is utterly alien to our understanding.\nCosmicism often invokes feelings of insignificance, hopelessness, and the futility of mankind\u0026rsquo;s existence. It is usually devoid of any consideration of divine entities that care about humanity or of humanity having a specific purpose or goal in the universe.\nOn the other hand, \u0026ldquo;Cosmic Existentialism,\u0026rdquo; as elucidated through Raëlian philosophy, is a positive and proactive philosophical approach that encourages a metaphysical awareness of humanity\u0026rsquo;s position within the cosmos, our connection to infinity, and our interactions with extraterrestrial life. It is based on the consideration of four levels, starting with the infinite cosmos, and narrowing down to individual fulfillment. Far from deeming human existence as insignificant or futile, it emphasizes individual freedom, authenticity, responsibility, and personal growth within the cosmic context.\nWhile both philosophies share a cosmological perspective, they diverge significantly in their approach to humanity\u0026rsquo;s role and significance within the universe. Cosmicism leans toward nihilism and existential dread, while Cosmic Existentialism promotes personal growth, societal questioning, reverence for creators, and alignment with the infinite cosmos.\nSee also # Wiki › Infinity Wiki › New Commandments Wiki › Raëlism\nExternal links # Existentialism | Wikipedia\nThe term \u0026ldquo;level\u0026rdquo; can also be subsituted with \u0026ldquo;realm\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;plane\u0026rdquo; as each level of consideration represents a given size of space.

According to the story, God created the world and everything in it in six days, and on the seventh day, he rested.\nEach of the six days of creation is described in detail, and on each day, God creates something new. On the first day, God creates light and separates it from darkness. On the second day, he creates the sky and the oceans. On the third day, he creates land and vegetation. On the fourth day, he creates the sun, moon, and stars. On the fifth day, he creates the birds and sea creatures. On the sixth day, he creates the land animals and humans.\nThe 7-day creation myth is considered by many to be a foundational story in the Bible and an important part of the Judeo-Christian tradition. While it is widely accepted as a religious and cultural narrative, the interpretation of the story has been the subject of much debate and discussion throughout history, particularly in light of modern scientific discoveries. Some view the story as a literal account of the creation of the universe, while others interpret it metaphorically or allegorically.\nCreation myths in the Near East # The creation story in the Book of Genesis is just one of many creation myths that existed in the ancient Near East. Scholars have long recognized that the biblical account of creation was influenced by earlier myths and stories from Mesopotamia and Egypt. Some of the creation myths that may have influenced the Genesis story include:\nThe Enūma Eliš (Akkadian: 𒂊𒉡𒈠𒂊𒇺): This is a Babylonian creation myth that tells the story of how the god Marduk defeated the chaotic goddess Tiamat and created the world out of her body. The Enuma Elish is one of the oldest creation myths, and it is likely that it influenced the Genesis story in some way.\nThe Atra-ḫasīs Epic (Akkadian: 𒀜𒊏𒄩𒋀): This is an Akkadian epic that tells the story of how the gods created humans to do their work, but later became displeased with them and sent a flood to destroy them. The Atra-Hasis Epic has some similarities to the flood story in the Book of Genesis.\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh: This is an ancient Sumerian epic that tells the story of Gilgamesh, a legendary king of Uruk. The epic contains a flood story that is similar to the one in the Book of Genesis.\nThe Heliopolitan Creation Myth: This is an Egyptian creation myth that tells the story of how the god Atum created the world by masturbating and spitting out the sun and the first humans. While the Heliopolitan Creation Myth is quite different from the Genesis story, it is possible that it influenced some aspects of it.\nThese are just a few examples of the many creation myths that may have influenced the Genesis story. It is likely that the biblical writers were familiar with these myths and drew upon them to create their own unique account of creation.\nIt is possible that the Genesis version of the creation story developed independently of the other creation myths in the ancient Near East. While there are similarities between the Genesis story and other creation myths, scholars like to point out that there are also significant differences that suggest the biblical writers were not simply copying earlier myths. As such an example, it is thought that the Genesis story emphasizes monotheism, the idea that there is only one God who created the world, whereas many of the other creation myths are polytheistic and involve multiple gods.\nThis is not accurate as the name of God, Elohim is technically a plural, implying a multitude of godly beings.\nSeven days of creation # The idea that the \u0026ldquo;days\u0026rdquo; mentioned in the Biblical creation narrative of Genesis could be understood as representing much longer periods of time, specifically 2'160 years each, is based on the belief in the concept of precessional cycles. Precession refers to the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis, which takes approximately 26,000 years to complete one cycle.\nAccording to this interpretation, each \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; in the creation story would represent one of the 12 astrological ages in the precession cycle, with each age lasting approximately 2'160 years. Proponents of this interpretation argue that the seven days of creation correspond to the seven main astrological ages: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra.\nIn the Hebrew language and in the Bible, the word \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; (Hebrew: יום) is typically translated as \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; and is understood to refer to a 24-hour period. The idea that \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; could mean a much longer period of time, such as a precessional month, is not a widely accepted interpretation within the scholarly community. However, the term can also be interpreted as meaning a general period of time, rather than a literal day.\nThere are a few reasons for this. First, the word \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; is used in different ways throughout the Bible. In some cases, it refers to a literal day, as in the day and night cycle. But in other contexts, it can refer to a longer period of time, such as an epoch or era. Also, the interpretation of \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; as a longer period of time is supported by the use of the phrase \u0026ldquo;evening and morning\u0026rdquo; in the Book of Genesis. Some scholars suggest that this phrase may be used to signify the beginning and end of a creative period, rather than a literal day.\nThus \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo;, in its context, is sometimes translated as: \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; (Gen 4:3, Is. 30:8); \u0026ldquo;year\u0026rdquo; (I Kings 1:1, 2 Chronicles 21:19, Amos 4:4); \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo; (Gen 18:11, 24:1 and 47:28; Joshua 23:1 and 23:2); \u0026ldquo;always\u0026rdquo; (Deuteronomy 5:29, 6:24 and 14:23, and in 2 Chronicles 18:7); \u0026ldquo;season\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 40:4, Joshua 24:7, 2 Chronicles 15:3); epoch or as many take it literally to as a 24-hour day (Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31).1\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Raël\u0026rsquo;s book, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, offers a unique interpretation of the Book of Genesis that is based on the idea that the biblical story was transmitted to humanity by extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim. According to Raël, the Elohim are the creators of life on Earth, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been visiting our planet for thousands of years.\nIn the eponymous chapter Genesis, Yahweh as the main narrator elaborates a very important commentary upon which the whole of idea of the Creation Days not being mere days, but precessional Ages, is predicated on:\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.\n— Genesis 1: 5.\nThis research took quite some time. The \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.\nBased on the assumption that the first day lasted a period in which the sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, which is the astronomical definition of a Great Month, subsequent days of creation must have been of the same length. Therefore, if the creation account in Genesis took 7 days, this would amount to a period of 15,120 years, which is one-twelfth of the length of a precessional Great Year.\nPrequel to Genesis # In the same chapter Genesis, Yahweh tells us about how the scientific progress on their home planet led to the events described in the Genesis account.\nA very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.\nThe scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.\nSince at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live.\nAs soon as the Elohimian civilization began to explore remote interstellar worlds, Earth - the planet we call home - was among one of the worlds they discovered.\nFirst day # Yahweh then elaborates on the first day of creation, which involved a thorough study of Earth\u0026rsquo;s composition and atmosphere. At that point in their study, the planet was shrouded in water and a dense mist.\nIn the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.\n— Genesis 1: 1.\nElohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. They \u0026ldquo;created\u0026rdquo;, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.\nAnd the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.\n— Genesis 1: 2.\nThis means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.\nAnd Elohim saw the light, that it was good.\n— Genesis 1: 4.\nTo create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the \u0026ldquo;light was good\u0026rdquo;.\nSecond day # The second day of creation describes Elohimian scientific and explorative activity where their scientists studied cosmic rays above the clouds, and then descended to a lower altitude, where they were between the clouds and the ocean. The phrase \u0026ldquo;the waters which were above the firmament\u0026rdquo; refers to the clouds, which were seen as a barrier between the Earth and the heavens, while \u0026ldquo;the waters which were under the firmament\u0026rdquo; refers to the ocean that covered the planet.\nAnd Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.\n— Genesis 1: 7.\nAfter studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, \u0026ldquo;the waters which were above the firmament\u0026rdquo;, and the ocean covering the whole planet, \u0026ldquo;the waters which were under the firmament\u0026rdquo;.\nThird day # The third day is being described as to the period of time where the Elohimian scientists use a combination of advanced technology and experimentation to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents and plant life. The scientists study the ocean floor and discover that it is not very deep, and then use explosions to raise matter from the bottom of the sea and pile it up into one place to form a continent. They then create plant life from chemical substances in a large laboratory, aiming for successful reproduction.\nThe scientists work in small research teams to create different types of plants suited for various climates, and meet regularly to share their findings and creations. Brilliant artists join the scientists to give some plants a decorative role, enhancing their appearance and perfume. The people on their own planet follow the scientists\u0026rsquo; progress from afar with great interest and admiration.\nLet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.\n— Genesis 1: 9.\nAfter they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere.\nSo then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent. Originally there was on Earth only one continent, and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents, which have drifted apart over many years, used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass.\nLet the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.\n— Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction.\nThe few blares of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.\nFourth day # The fourth day of creation is being explained that by observing the stars and the sun, the Elohimian scientists were able to measure the duration of days, months, and years on Earth. This allowed them to regulate their lives on this new planet, which had different durations of days and years from their home planet. Their research in astronomy also helped them to locate themselves precisely on Earth and to gain a deeper understanding of the planet. This understanding of astronomy and the Earth led to a deeper knowledge of their new home and the ability to adapt to it.\nLet there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.\n— Genesis 1: 14.\nBy observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.\nFifth day # The fifth day of creation is being described as a period of time where the Elohiman scientists and artists went on to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s aquatic animals and birds. The scientists and artists create a natural balance in the ocean ecosystem by creating plankton, small fish, seaweed, and large fish, which can feed on each other without causing harm to other species. The artists also put pressure on the scientists to create the most visually stunning and colorful birds, resulting in some species that were not well-suited for flight.\nThe scientists and artists organize competitions to determine the most beautiful and interesting animals, and even focus on the behavior of the animals during their mating rituals. Some groups of scientists also create monstrous animals, the dinosaurs, which prove to be a source of concern for some individuals back on their home planet who opposed the creation plans.\nLet the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.\n— Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.\nThus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as \u0026ldquo;ecology\u0026rdquo;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.\nAfter the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.\nThe contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.\nSome other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nSixth day # The sixth day of cretion is being described as a period of time where the creation of land animals on Earth takes place after the marine organisms and birds have already been genetically engineered. The scientists initially created herbivores, followed by carnivores to maintain balance in the ecosystem. There was a desire among the most skilled scientists to create an artificial human being like themselves, and each team set to work, but people on their home planet were outraged when they heard about these test tube children who might threaten their world. It was agreed that the new humans would be left to live in a very primitive way, without being taught anything scientific.\nLet the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind.\n— Genesis 1: 24.\nAfter marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.\nIt was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making \u0026ldquo;test tube children\u0026rdquo; who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.\nLet Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\n— Genesis 1: 26.\n\u0026ldquo;In our image!\u0026rdquo; You can see that the resemblance is striking. [\u0026hellip;]\nSeventh day # The seventh day of creation is being described as the aftermath of the extensive creation period on Earth, where the Elohimian team of scientists and artists who created the planet begin to encounter trouble. One team located in the area that is now Israel had created the most intelligent human beings on the planet, and steps were taken to ensure that these beings did not surpass their creators. This meant that the humans were educated in order to measure their intelligence, but were kept in ignorance of certain scientific secrets.\nThe humans were taught the names and powers of the plants and animals around them, in order to develop a better understanding of the world they lived in. However, they were warned not to touch the scientific books, or they would die. The chapter ends with the scientists and artists finding joy in teaching the two children, a male and female, who were eager to learn about the world around them.\n[\u0026hellip;] That is when the trouble started for us. The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.\nTheir animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth\u0026rdquo;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.\nOf every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die\u0026hellip;\n— Genesis 2: 16-17.\nThis means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.\nHe brought them to the man to see what he would name them.\n— Genesis 2: 19.\nHuman beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them. Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.\nIt is noteworthy that the seventh day happens in the second chapter of Genesis implying that the 6 days of creation mark the creation itself and the seventh day is where the actual narration happens.\nOur take # By piecing together various clues, it is important to determine the location of the first day of creation within the precessional Great Year. After careful consideration, we believe it is appropriate to place the first day of creation in the Age of Capricorn, and the last day of creation (the 6th day) in the Age of Leo. The aftermath of Genesis, or the 7th day of creation, would occur during the Age of Cancer.\nIt is during the Age of Cancer that the well-known story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden would take place, along with the subsequent events narrated in Genesis.\nBegins in Ends in Zodiacal house Day of Creation Theme 21'810 BC 19'650 BC Age of Capricorn 1st day Exploration 19'650 BC 17'490 BC Age of Sagittarius 2nd day Analysis 17'490 BC 15'330 BC Age of Scorpio 3rd day Terraforming 15'330 BC 13'170 BC Age of Libra 4th day Accomodation 13'170 BC 11'010 BC Age of Virgo 5th day Ecology 11'010 BC 8'850 BC Age of Leo 6th day Human beings 8'850 BC 6'690 BC Age of Cancer 7th day of Rest Aftermath See also # Wiki › Bible Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Great Month Wiki › Life engineering Read more # Intro › Timeline › Preamble External links # Genesis creation narrative | Wikipedia Creation | Jewish Encyclopedia Genesis (Old Testament | Britannica) Genesis, the Book of. | Jewish Encyclopedia Yom (יוֹם) is translated as day (1115 times), days (635), today (172), time (45), chronicles (38), daily (22), always (14), years (13), life (12), long (11) age (8), yearly (5) and other meanings in the NASB Bible translation.

The basic principle behind Geniocracy is that intelligence and creativity are the most important qualities for good governance and decision-making, and that people with these traits should be given more representation and influence in government.\nAccording to geniocracy, intelligence should be measured objectively and used as the primary criteria for selecting politicians and government officials. This philosophy aims to create a society in which intelligent individuals have the power to make decisions for the betterment of all, rather than just for a privileged few.\nIn a Geniocratic system, intelligence and creativity are tested and quantified, and individuals are assigned a \u0026ldquo;genius factor\u0026rdquo; based on their scores. Those with higher genius factors have more representation and influence in government, while those with lower scores have less. The theory behind Geniocracy is that by giving more power to individuals with high intelligence and creativity, society as a whole will benefit from better decisions, policies, and innovations.\nProponents of Geniocracy argue that traditional democratic systems do not always produce the best outcomes because they are influenced by factors such as wealth, charisma, and media presence, rather than raw intelligence and creativity. They believe that by prioritizing these traits, society will become more efficient, prosperous, and fair.\nCritics of Geniocracy argue that it is inherently elitist and could lead to a small group of people with high intelligence and creativity monopolizing power and decision-making, while the rest of society is left with little representation. They also argue that intelligence and creativity are not the only qualities needed for good governance, and that qualities such as empathy, compassion, and experience are just as important.\nOverall, Geniocracy is a political ideology that has gained some traction in recent years, but is still a relatively unknown concept to most people. It should be noted that geniocracy is a controversial and largely untested idea, and there are many questions about how intelligence would be measured and how such a system would be implemented in practice. It remains to be seen whether it will gain wider acceptance and influence in the future.\nRelationship with democracy # Proponents of Geniocracy argue that it is a democratic system because it draws intelligence and talent from a large pool of people, rather than being limited to a select few. Unlike traditional democratic systems, which are based on the principle of one person, one vote, Geniocracy uses intelligence and creativity tests to determine the \u0026ldquo;genius factor\u0026rdquo; of individuals. Those with higher genius factors have more representation and influence in government, while those with lower scores have less.\nThe idea behind this is that by giving more power to individuals with high intelligence and creativity, society as a whole will benefit from better decisions, policies, and innovations. This means that even if a person is not elected directly, they can still have a significant impact on the governance of their country if they have a high enough genius factor.\nIn this sense, proponents of Geniocracy argue that it is a more democratic system than traditional democracy because it allows for a wider range of people to have a voice and influence in government, rather than limiting power to a small group of elected officials. They believe that by prioritizing intelligence and creativity, society will become more efficient, prosperous, and fair, and that this will have a positive impact on the lives of everyone, regardless of their genius factor.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, Yahweh explores a way to handle Earthly political representation and governance which he tentatively named Geniocracy. The first paragraph of the New Commandments called Geniocracy goes as follows:\nFirst of all, let us look at the political and economic aspects of life.\nWhat kind of people allows humanity to progress? The geniuses.\nTherefore, your world must revalorize its geniuses and allow them to govern the Earth.\nPower was in the hands of brutes, who were superior to others because of their muscular strength. Next in power were the rich, who used their money to employ many \u0026ldquo;brutes\u0026rdquo; in their service. Then came the politicians who ensnared the people of democratic countries with their own hopes — not to mention military men whose success has been based around the rational organization of brutality.\nThe only type of people you have never placed in power are the ones who help humanity to progress. Whether they discovered the wheel, gunpowder, the internal combustion engine or the atom, the geniuses have always allowed less intelligent people in power to benefit from their inventions. Often such people have used peaceful inventions for murderous ends. All that must be changed.\nFor this to happen, you must abolish all your electoral and polling systems because in their present form, they are completely unsuited to human development. Each person is a useful cell in this huge body we call humanity. The cell in your foot should not decide whether or not your hand should pick up a given object. It is the brain, which must decide, and if the object in question is good, the cell of your foot will benefit from it. It is not up to the foot to vote. Its job is simply to transport the body -including the brain- and it is not capable of judging if what the hand takes is good or not.\nVotes only have a positive effect when there is an equivalence of knowledge and intellect. Copernicus was condemned by a majority of incompetent people because he was the only one at that time who had a sufficiently high level of comprehension. Although the Church -that is t say the majority- believed the Earth was the center of the universe, this turned out to be wrong. The Earth really revolved around the sun, and Copernicus -the minority- turned out to be right.\nWhen the first cars were invented, if we had asked everyone to vote to establish whether cars should be allowed to exist or not, the majority, who knew nothing about cars and did not care, would have responded negatively, and you would still be riding in a horse and cart. So, how can you change all that?\nThese days, you have psychologists who are capable of creating tests to evaluate the intelligence and adaptation of every individual.\nThese tests should be applied systematically from infancy onward in order to define each individual\u0026rsquo;s orientation towards subjects studied.\nWhen individuals reach a responsible age, their intellectual coefficient can be measured and included on their identity or voter\u0026rsquo;s card. Only those with an intellectual capacity of at least fifty per cent above the average should be eligible for a public post. To vote, individuals would need an intellectual coefficient of at least ten per cent above average. If such a system existed now, many of your present politicians would not hold the positions they do today.\nThis is a totally democratic system. There are many engineers, for example, who are of lower than average intelligence, but who have very good memories and have obtained several academic degrees because of this.\nOn the other hand, there are many laborers or farm workers who have no specialized education at all, but whose intelligence is fifty per cent above the average. What is totally unacceptable now is that the voice of someone whom you might vulgarly call \u0026ldquo;a cretin\u0026rdquo; is worth as much as that of a genius, who has thought maturely about the way he or she is going to vote. In some small cities, elections are won by the candidate who buys people the most drinks — not by the individual whose policies are the most interesting.\nTherefore, right from the start, the right to vote should be reserved for those people whose brains are more suited to thinking and finding solutions to problems - that is to say, an elite group of high intelligence. This does not necessarily mean those people who have done the most studying.\nWe are talking about placing the genius in power, and you may call that \u0026ldquo;Geniocracy\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this passage, the author advocates for a system of government called \u0026ldquo;Geniocracy\u0026rdquo; in which individuals with high intelligence and aptitude are given the power to govern. The author argues that historically, power has been held by those with physical strength, wealth, or political maneuvering skills, rather than by those who make significant contributions to human progress, such as inventors and scientists.\nThe author argues that the current electoral and polling systems are not suited to promoting human progress, as they allow people who are not well-informed or who lack intelligence to have the same political influence as those who are highly intelligent. The author suggests that psychological tests should be used to measure individuals\u0026rsquo; intelligence from a young age, and that only those with an intellectual capacity above a certain threshold should be eligible for public office or to vote.\nThe author contends that this system is more democratic, as it gives power to those best suited to make informed decisions and solve complex problems. The author also notes that this system does not necessarily favor those with the most education, but rather those with the greatest natural intelligence. Furthermore, the author calls for a more merit-based system of government that values intelligence and the ability to make positive contributions to society.\nSee also # Wiki › New Commandments External links # Geniocracy | Wikipedia Geniocracy: Government of the People, for the People, by the Geniuses "},{"id":"85","href":"/wiki/golden-age/","title":"Golden Age","description":"Golden Age, the moment in time when humanity has reached a level of scientific sophistication and technological prowess to overcome self-destruction, enabling us to usher into an age of abundance and wealth where we learn the Truth about our own past and receive the inheritance promised by our Fathers, the Elohim.

In these traditions, the arrival of the Messiah is seen as the central event of the End Times, and is believed to be the beginning of the Golden Age.\nIn Hinduism and Buddhism, the end of the world is seen as a natural cycle of creation and destruction, and the arrival of the Golden Age is seen as marking the start of a new cycle of creation.\nSee also # Wiki › World Age Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius External links # Golden Age | Wikipedia "},{"id":"86","href":"/wiki/great-flood/","title":"Great Flood","description":"Great Flood, also known as the Great Deluge, a cataclysmic event caused by a preventive military measure which got deliberately initiated by the distressed government of the distant home planet of the Elohim who wished to put an end to the independent scientific progress on Earth.","content":"The Great Flood is a story that appears in several different religious traditions, including the Bible, and describes a massive flood that covers the entire Earth and destroys all life except for a select few. In the biblical account, the Great Flood is described in the book of Genesis as a punishment from God for the wickedness and corruption of humanity.\nAccording to the story, God chose Noah, a righteous man, to build an ark to save himself, his family, and two of every kind of animal from the flood. The rains lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, and when they stopped, the ark came to rest on the top of a mountain. Noah then released a dove, which eventually returned with an olive branch, signaling that the waters had receded and that it was safe to leave the ark.\nThe story of the Great Flood has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Some view it as a literal account of a historical event, while others interpret it as a metaphor for a universal or cultural experience. Regardless of interpretation, the Great Flood is an important part of the Judeo-Christian tradition and is widely recognized as a symbol of divine judgment and renewal.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # The Great Flood is mentioned by Yahweh. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, showcases the mentioning of the Great Flood:\nWhen the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\n— Genesis 6: 4.\nThere you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.\nAnd Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n— Genesis 6: 5.\nThe \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;, as far as those on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.\nThe government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.\nThis was true figuratively speaking, but in reality -and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this- a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nWhen the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe ark\u0026hellip; was lift up above the earth.\n— Genesis 7: 17.\nAs you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water.\nThen it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:\nAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n— Genesis 7: 24.\nThe spacecraft had three sections:\n[\u0026hellip;] and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n— Genesis 6: 16.\nLater it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.\nAnd Elohim remembered Noah\u0026hellip; and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged.\n— Genesis 8: 1.\nAfter monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:\nAnd Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\n— Genesis 8: 20.\nThe creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n[\u0026hellip;] for the imagination of man\u0026rsquo;s heart is evil.\n— Genesis 8: 21.\nThe goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.\nAnd by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n— Genesis 10: 32.\nIn this passage, it is described how the Elohim, the creators were concerned about the rapid scientific progress made by humans during the antediluvian times, and they ultimately decided to destroy all life on Earth with nuclear weaponry. However, the exiled creators asked Noah to build a spaceship to safeguard the entierey of all life genetically engineerd during the events of Genesis. This was achieved by extracting the genetic information of a given living cell of each species. The goal of this preservation project was to recreate life after the destruction would have happened.\nNoah\u0026rsquo;s ark, a spacecraft capable of redundantly storing the entire genetic database was build. After the explosion had taken place, the Pangean continent was submerged by a tidal wave, but the spacecraft, Noah\u0026rsquo;s ark, was lifted above the Earth and waited until the radioactive fallout subsided. After monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and cattle to the creators to ensure they survived.\nThe creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells that had been preserved aboard the spaceship. The passage suggests that scientific progress is the goal of humankind, but it is important to maintain a respectful and grateful relationship with those who have created and preserved life.\nSee also # Wiki › Antediluvian Wiki › Noahic Covenant Wiki › Noah\u0026#39;s Ark Wiki › Pangaea Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Gemini External links # Flood myth | Wikipedia Flood myth | Britannica Flood, the. | Jewish Encyclopedia Great Flood | New World Encyclopedia "},{"id":"87","href":"/wiki/great-month/","title":"Great Month","description":"Great Month, also known as Astrological age or World Age, a period of time of around 2'160 years, the amount of time it takes for the phenomonen of precession to shift the Zodiacal band on the ecliptic westwards by 30 degrees, or a twelth of of the full circonference of 360 degrees. 12 Great Months amount to one Great Year.","content":"The precessional Great Year refers to the period of time it takes for the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis to complete one full cycle of precession, which is the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis in space. This cycle is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge, and it takes approximately 25,800 years to complete.\nIn many ancient cultures, the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis was seen as a metaphor for the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the cosmos. The precessional cycle was divided into smaller units of time, such as the precessional Great Month, which was a unit of time equal to one-twelfth of the precessional cycle, or approximately 2,150 years.\nDuration # Dividing the length of duration of the precessional cycle into 12 segments gives us the length of duration of each segment. The same way a year is divided into twelve months, the precessional Great Year is best divided into 12 Great Months. Depending on the length of duration of the Great Month, which nothing but the amount of time one complete cycle of precession takes, one can determine how long a monthly segment is.\nAs with the year where we count 365 days where we know it takes a slightly bit longer for the Earth to complete a full revolution around the Sun, we apply an approximative, but convenient count of years to the precession. The current estimation for the precession to complete is 25,771.5 years, a number that is based on the mathematically sound method of extrapolation of a much shorter time span. The extrapolation is applied to a set of meticulous measurements of the shifting of closer stellar bodies against more distant ones over a certain amount of time.\nWith the empirical number of 25'771.5 years for a given precessional cycle, the Great Month would amount to 2'147.625 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{25'771.5y}{12} = 2'147.625y \\end{equation*} $$\nWhile the estimations get preciser over with the years passing and technology getting more sensible, we content ourselves with using another number, namely 25'920 years. From a mathematical point of view, this number is very convenient as it is part of of the finite simple groups as it can be split with the factors $2^6 ⋅ 3^4 ⋅ 5$. It is also divisible by $360$, a convenient number for angular notations, giving $72 y$ per degree.\nWith the approximative number of 25'920 years for a given precessional cycle, the Great Month would amount to 2'160 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{25'920y}{12} = 2'160y \\end{equation*} $$\nGreat Day # If the Great Year can be divided into 12 segments, giving us 12 Great Months, we can also divide it by 360 and name it a Great Day. As stated earlier, the approximative, but convenient number of 25'920 years for a given precessional cycle allows us to properly divide it by 360, giving 72 years as for the duration of a Great Day. It is interesting to note that the average life span of a human being comes close to that number.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Year Wiki › Precession Wiki › World Age External links # Astrological age | Wikipedia "},{"id":"88","href":"/wiki/great-return/","title":"Great Return","description":"The concept of the Great Return' refers to the anticipated arrival of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, known as the Elohim, on Earth. According to the communications allegedly received from these entities, their return hinges upon humanity's desire for their arrival, respect for their position as our creators, and assurance that they will not be threatened by our military forces. Their arrival, if accepted and welcomed, promises to deliver a quantum leap in our scientific knowledge, equivalent to a leap of 25,000 years. The 'Great Return' would likely have profound impacts on human society, akin to those posited in the realm of extraterrestrial contact theory, potentially reshaping our scientific and technological landscapes, socio-political structures, and religious beliefs. However, this transformative encounter is contingent upon humanity's evolution towards peace, unity, and respect for our cosmic progenitors.","content":"Exploring the potential changes to human society resulting from interaction with an extraterrestrial civilization encompasses shifts in our scientific and technological understanding, religious and political structures, and even impacts on our ecosystems.\nThe scale and nature of the potential shifts triggered by such contact can vary widely, depending on several factors: the technological prowess of the alien civilization, its intent (whether benevolent or malevolent), and the extent to which humans and extraterrestrials can understand each other. Additionally, the method of contact—be it through electromagnetic signals, direct physical encounter, or discovering an extraterrestrial artifact—may also influence the outcomes.\nThe potential ramifications of such contact are often compared to historical encounters between two vastly different human cultures on Earth, such as the interactions following Christopher Columbus\u0026rsquo;s voyages. More often than not, these encounters have led to the disruption, if not destruction, of the contacted civilization. Consequently, the destruction of human society is a conceivable result of extraterrestrial contact. Such contact can also be seen as analogous to the interactions between native and invasive species vying for the same ecological niche.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In the inaugural work of the Raëlian canon, \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth,\u0026rdquo; the entity known as Yahweh discloses prerequisites for the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s return to Earth, laying out specific conditions that humanity needs to meet. He states:\nThere, now you know the truth. You must write it down and make it known throughout the world. If people on Earth want us to give them the benefit of our experience and help them gain 25,000 years of scientific knowledge, they have to show us that they want to meet us, and above all demonstrate that they deserve it, and that all this can be done without any danger to us.\nIf we give our knowledge to humanity, we have to be sure they will make good use of it. Our observations in recent years have not shown that wisdom rules the Earth. Certainly there has been progress, but some people still die of hunger, and a warlike spirit still exists throughout the world. We know that our arrival could improve many things and unite nations, but we have to feel that people really want to see us, and that they are truly starting to unify.\nWe also have to feel that they really want to see us arrive, knowing fully who we are and understanding the true meaning of our arrival. Several times human warplanes have tried to chase our crafts, taking us for enemies.\nIn this excerpt, Yahweh emphasizes that the Elohim are ready to share their advanced scientific knowledge and experience with humanity, but only under specific conditions. First, they need to ascertain that humanity genuinely wants to encounter them and is deserving of their wisdom. Second, they must be assured of their own safety upon landing on Earth. They express their concern about the current state of the world, where people suffer from hunger and a pervasive, belligerent mindset persists. Though the Elohim acknowledge their arrival could greatly benefit humanity and potentially foster global unity, they underline the importance of humanity\u0026rsquo;s earnest desire for their return. Furthermore, they must be welcomed with a proper understanding of their identity and the profound implications of their arrival, rather than being mistaken for adversaries, as has happened in the past.\nThe specific location of the anticipated \u0026lsquo;Great Return\u0026rsquo;, which should take place at a residence, also referred to as simply the Embassy, or even the infamous Third Temple, that needs to be prepared in a country with a mild climate. This location should ideally be recognized as a neutral territory by both the nation in which it is situated and other nations worldwide, essentially serving as the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s Earthly embassy.\nIn a further exploration of the prerequisites for the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s arrival, Yahweh details the expected attitudes and reactions from humanity in the book \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth.\u0026rdquo; The passage reads:\nAs I have already told you, we know that our official arrival would accelerate many things. But we will wait until we see that human beings really want us to come, that they love us and respect us like the parents that we truly are, and that our spacecrafts will not be threatened by your destructive military forces.\nYahweh reinforces the idea that the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s arrival on Earth would precipitate significant progress and change. However, he reiterates the need for a genuine desire from humanity for such an event. Humanity should regard the Elohim with love and respect, acknowledging them as their creators or spiritual parents. Moreover, a significant condition for their arrival is a guarantee of safety, especially from human military forces. It is implied that the Elohim seek a peaceful encounter and integration with humanity, devoid of hostility or misunderstanding.\nA remarkable note in the post-script message titled \u0026ldquo;Message of the Elohim, December 13th, 1997\u0026rdquo; from the anthology work \u0026ldquo;Intelligent Design: Messages from the Designers\u0026rdquo; is the introduction of the concept of the \u0026ldquo;Great Return\u0026rdquo; by Yahweh. In this message, Yahweh states:\nThe hour of our Great Return is near, and we will support and protect the most devoted ones among you. Your enemies will witness our might more and more, most especially the usurper from Rome, his bishops and all those who act in our name without being appointed.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMay your joy in seeing the approach of our Great Return give you wings to overcome the last obstacles of the journey. We are so close to this day, that whenever you meditate, you should be able to feel our presence.\nThis passage emphasizes the imminent nature of the \u0026ldquo;Great Return,\u0026rdquo; implying a looming arrival of the Elohim. Yahweh assures their devoted followers of protection and support, hinting at a form of cosmic justice against their perceived enemies. The mention of the \u0026ldquo;usurper from Rome\u0026rdquo; and his bishops indicates a criticism of established religious institutions that claim to act in the name of the divine without authorization. Further, Yahweh encourages followers to derive joy and motivation from the anticipation of the \u0026ldquo;Great Return,\u0026rdquo; suggesting that their meditative practices may allow them to sense the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s close presence.\nOur take # The cultural implications of potential extraterrestrial contact have been a subject of speculation and analysis within various scientific, philosophical, and creative communities. These speculations range from utopian visions of a shared cosmic destiny to dystopian fears of utter destruction or subjugation. In this context, the messages contained within the Raëlian texts - The Book Which Tells The Truth, Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet, and Intelligent Design: Messages from the Designers - are a distinctive perspective on this matter, providing a detailed narrative of past contact and future reunification with extraterrestrial beings. This narrative, coined as the \u0026ldquo;Great Return\u0026rdquo; within the texts, not only establishes the philosophical basis for the Raëlian movement but also adds to the broader discourse on the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact.\nThe Raëlian texts elucidate the criteria for this proposed reunion with the Elohim, humanity\u0026rsquo;s creators as per their belief system. The Elohim mandate a desire for their return, a unification of humanity, and a demonstration of wisdom and peace on Earth before they would bestow their advanced knowledge upon us. Such a narrative introduces a unique angle into the discourse on extraterrestrial contact: that our actions as a species may determine the manner and implications of such an event.\nThe Raëlian philosophy, with its anticipated \u0026ldquo;Great Return,\u0026rdquo; can be viewed as an embodiment of a utopian vision, wherein humanity unites under the wisdom of our creators, paving the way for an era of enlightenment, the Golden Age of old, the Aquarian Age to blossom.\nSee also # Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Golden Age Wiki › Third Temple Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius Intro › Take Aways › The Great Awakening External links # Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact | Wikipedia "},{"id":"89","href":"/wiki/great-year/","title":"Great Year","description":"Great Year, also known as a Platonic Year, a period of time of around 25'920 years, the amount of time a full precessional cycle takes to complete.","content":"The Great Year is defined as the period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, which amounts to 25'920 years. This cycle is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge. The number of 25'920 is close enough and slightly more convenient than the actual scientifically established number of 25'800 which is considered more accurate, even though it itself is as estimation derived by extrapolation. The former number, which we consider to be more convenient, is derived from the ancient observation of westward shift of 1 degree every 72 years. The cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is therefore a full 360 degrees of that westward shift which gives us:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 360 deg \\cdotp 72 \\dfrac{y}{deg} = 25'920 y \\end{equation*} $$\nAll these numbers are convenient as one can easily divide the full cycle of 25'920 by 12 or by 360. The former represents a Great Month of 2'160 years and the latter a Great Day of 72 years. It is noteworthy that a westward shift of the equinoxes around the ecliptic of one degree roughly amounts to the life span of a human being in contemporary times. To put this phenomenon into more pratical perspective, one degree can roughly be equated to the width of a human thumb against the backdrop of the sky.\nPrecession # The natural cause that accounts for the cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is called precession and is defined in regards to its impact on the planet Earth as the steady change of orientation of the axis of rotation of Earth. In other words, besides the two fundamental motions of our planet Earth, the rotation of the planet around its own axis which we call the day/night cycle, and the revolution of the planet in its orbit around the Sun which we call the year cycle, there is a third key motion which accounts for yet another important cycle, but which lasts too long for us to take notice. This third key motion is called the precession of the equinoxes or sometimes just simply precession.\nEcliptic # The ecliptic is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the sun. To us on Earth observing the ecliptic upon the grounds of the very plane twe\u0026rsquo;re standing on, the ecliptic is the path that the Sun evolves on around the celestial sphere against the backdrop of the stars over the course of a year. More visually spoken, in a given year, the Sun traverses ecliptic once if we one choses to watch the sun at a specific time of the day, let\u0026rsquo;s say at sunrise.\nZodiac # The zodiac is a belt-shaped band of the sky that extends roughly 8 degrees north or south of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun during one year as defined just before. That belt is also the region of the sky within which the Moon and other visible planets are moving along their path. The zodiac is called that way because of twelve star constellations that can be found within the zodiac belt and are, in Western tradition, mostly associated with animals. On other words, the Sun traverses these twelve constellation within a year.\nEquinox # The equinoxes are two specific days in a given year where the Sun crosses the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator, which means that it appears directly above the equator. This is also the moment where daytime and nighttime are quasi equal all over the world. Etymologically, equinox comes from the Latin aequinoctium, which means \u0026lsquo;of equal night\u0026rsquo;. Because that happens twice a year, we differentiate between the vernal equinox which happens during Spring time in the Northern hemisphere and the autumnal equinox which happens during Fall time in the Northern hemisphere. The equinoxes are part of the total of four cardinal days in a year. The two other being the solstices which each mark either the longest or the shortest day in a given year.\nPrecession of the Equinoxes # The precession of the equinoxes is another word to define the precessional phenomenon on Earth by accounting of the steady shift of the zodiacal constellations in the backdrop of the rising sun on one of the equinoctial days over the lenghty period of 25'920 years. In other words, if one observes sunrise on let\u0026rsquo;s say the 20th of March (one of the possible days of the vernal equinox), as of 2022, the sun is going to rise right in front of the intersection of two zodiacal constellations, namely right in between Pisces and Aquarius. Roughly 2'160 years ago, that very sunrise was to be observed in between Aries and Pisces. In another 2'160 years from now on, the sunrise is going to be observed in between Aquarius and Saggitarius. There we go, if one wants to account for great periods of time such as world ages or aeons, the most natural way to do so is through the language of the precession of the equinoxes. That is why we say that the world is entering the Age of Aquarius.\nHamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill # Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill is a seminal work of comparative mythology written by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the mythology and cosmology of ancient civilizations, including Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Hindu, among others, and argues that these myths were based on a shared understanding of celestial mechanics and the precession of the equinoxes.\nThe authors propose that the myths and symbols of ancient cultures were not merely arbitrary and metaphorical, but were rooted in a profound knowledge of the astronomical cycles that govern the motions of the sun, moon, and stars. They argue that this knowledge was transmitted through an oral tradition of \u0026ldquo;astronomical mythography\u0026rdquo; that has largely been lost to us.\nThe central thesis of the book is that many of the world\u0026rsquo;s myths and symbols can be understood as attempts to explain the precession of the equinoxes, a phenomenon that occurs when the earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis gradually changes orientation over a period of approximately 26,000 years. This motion causes the position of the stars relative to the earth to shift, leading to changes in the position of the equinoxes (the points where the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator).\nAccording to the authors, the precession of the equinoxes was known to ancient cultures, who recognized that it had significant implications for the cosmic order and the fate of humankind. They argue that the Platonic Year, a period of approximately 25,920 years, corresponds to the time it takes for the equinoxes to complete a full cycle of the zodiac, and was therefore an important concept in ancient mythology.\nThe authors show how the mythologies of various cultures reflect a common concern with the cyclical nature of time, and how this is linked to the astronomical cycles of the precession of the equinoxes. They argue that myths such as the Egyptian tale of Osiris and the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh can be understood as symbolic representations of the precession of the equinoxes and its implications for the fate of humanity.\nBased on the premises of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill, if the precession of the equinoxes was discovered or observed early in human history, it would imply that ancient cultures had a much greater understanding of the workings of the cosmos than previously believed. It would suggest that they were capable of sophisticated astronomical observations and had developed a deep knowledge of celestial mechanics.\nIf this knowledge was indeed present in ancient times, it would have been encoded in mythology for several reasons. First, mythology served as a way to explain the workings of the natural world and to provide a sense of meaning and purpose to human existence. By linking the movements of the heavens to the fate of humanity, myths would have helped ancient cultures make sense of the world around them and to understand their place in the cosmos.\nSecond, mythology was often used as a way to transmit important knowledge and information from one generation to the next. In the absence of a written language or a scientific tradition, mythology would have served as a way to preserve and pass on knowledge about the precession of the equinoxes and other astronomical phenomena.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Month Wiki › Precession Wiki › World Age External links # Great Year | Wikipedia "},{"id":"90","href":"/resources/hamlets-mill/","title":"Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth","description":"\"Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth,\" written by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, presents the argument that ancient mythologies contain sophisticated knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes.

As such, ancient Hebrew draws its furthest origins not from an Earhtly anthrogenic source but was inhereted directly from our creators, the Elohim as they spoke an ancient version of Hebrew which human beings adopted since their inception on. While modern Hebrew cannot be considered to be equivalent with the Elohimian language, the Semitic language family on the other hand can be understood to preserve the legacy.","content":"Hebrew, a member of the Semitic language family, boasts a rich history that stretches back thousands of years. Rooted in the same linguistic branch as languages such as Arabic and Amharic, Hebrew has evolved considerably from its early iterations, known as Biblical or Classical Hebrew, into the Modern Hebrew spoken in Israel today.\nBiblical Hebrew, the language of the ancient Israelites and the scriptural language of the Hebrew Bible, displays distinctive Semitic features, such as a triconsonantal root system1 and a grammar based on a so-called verb tense-aspect2. Over the centuries, Hebrew has undergone significant morphological, syntactic, and phonetic changes, influenced by contact with various languages including Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic, and notably in its modern form, German.3\nHebrew\u0026rsquo;s script, the Hebrew alphabet, has been a constant presence throughout this evolution, though its form has changed over time. Early Hebrew was written using a script now referred to as Paleo-Hebrew4, which was eventually replaced by the square script we associate with Hebrew today.5\nMastering Hebrew is an invaluable asset for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Biblical scriptures. The Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, is the foundation of Jewish religious texts and a significant part of Christian Scriptures. Being able to read it in the original language opens up a wealth of nuanced meanings and interpretations that can be lost or obscured in translation.\nMoreover, an understanding of Hebrew can greatly enhance the study of Interlinear Bibles. These are editions of the scriptures that present the original Hebrew and translated English text side-by-side, line-by-line, thus offering a direct comparison between the original text and its translated counterpart. The knowledge of Hebrew can allow readers to delve beneath the surface of the English translation, giving them insight into the structure, connotations, and subtleties of the ancient language, and bringing them closer to the texts as they were first composed and understood.\nSemitic language family # The Semitic language family is a major subdivision of the Afroasiatic language group, native to the Middle East and parts of East Africa. Semitic languages are notable for their shared grammatical and syntactical features, including the use of root words and inflectional morphology.\nHebrew is a member of the Canaanite group of Semitic languages. Ancient Hebrew, also known as Classical Hebrew, was the language of the ancient Israelites and the vehicle for the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). Over centuries, Hebrew evolved into Mishnaic and then Medieval Hebrew, followed by Modern Hebrew which is spoken in Israel today.\nThe earliest known Semitic languages include Akkadian and Eblaite. Akkadian, the language of the ancient Akkadian Empire, existed from around 2800 to 500 BCE. Eblaite, spoken in the ancient city-state of Ebla (modern Syria), is known from texts dating back to the 24th century BCE. Another ancient Semitic language is Amorite, which existed from around 2000 to 1600 BCE.\nEspecially Akkadian is interesting in regards to ancient Hebrew as it shares a lot of cognates. The Bible refers to Akkad in Genesis 10:10, which states:\nThe beginning of his Nimrod\u0026rsquo;s kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these are the earliest Semitic languages we have written records for. The actual origins of the Semitic language family likely date back several thousand years earlier, perhaps to the 4th millennium BCE. These origins are largely unrecorded and thus open to speculation.\nRelationship with Sumerian # Sumerian, the language of ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, is considered a language isolate, which means it\u0026rsquo;s not demonstrably related to any other known language. Despite being geographically close to the early Semitic-speaking populations, Sumerian does not belong to the Semitic language family, or for that matter, the larger Afroasiatic language family.\nThe precise origins of the Sumerian language remain a mystery, as does its relationship, if any, to other languages. Several hypotheses have been proposed over the years, suggesting potential connections with various language families or hypothesizing that Sumerian might represent a branch of an ancient, possibly extinct language family, but none have achieved broad acceptance in the scholarly community.\nHowever, Sumerian had a significant influence on Akkadian, a Semitic language, which replaced Sumerian as the lingua franca of Mesopotamia around the turn of the 3rd millennium BCE. Even after Sumerian ceased to be spoken, it continued to be used as a language of education, much as Latin was in medieval Europe, and many Sumerian words, phrases, and grammatical structures were borrowed into Akkadian. But despite this influence, Sumerian and the Semitic languages are fundamentally different in their structure and vocabulary.\nProto-Semitic and Proto-Afroasiatic # Proto-Semitic and Proto-Afroasiatic are the reconstructed ancestors of the Semitic and Afroasiatic language families respectively. Because these languages predate written records, our understanding of them is based on linguistic reconstruction, a technique that involves comparing the features of related languages to infer the properties of their common ancestor.\nProto-Semitic is estimated to have been spoken around the 4th to 3rd millennium BCE, possibly in the Arabian Peninsula or the Levant. Some of its distinctive features include a specific set of consonants known as \u0026ldquo;emphatics,\u0026rdquo; a system of vowel harmony, and a grammar that based words on roots usually consisting of three consonants. Features of Proto-Semitic that it passed onto its descendants include verb aspect (rather than tense) as the primary grammatical category, a tendency towards using derivational morphology (creating words by adding prefixes, infixes, and suffixes to a root), and a triconsonantal root system (most words are built around a root of three consonants).\nProto-Afroasiatic is even older and more speculative. Estimates of when it was spoken range from 12,000 to 18,000 years ago. The original homeland of its speakers is also disputed, with proposals including North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Levant. Proto-Afroasiatic is hypothesized to have had a contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants, a large number of consonants produced with different positions of the tongue, and a rich system of noun inflection (changes in form to indicate grammatical relationships).\nReconstruction of ancestor languages # Understanding the earliest ancestral languages, such as Proto-Semitic or Proto-Afroasiatic, is a complex task that involves meticulous linguistic reconstruction. A key part of this process involves identifying and analyzing the similarities between ancient languages within the same family. Ancient Hebrew, often known as Biblical Hebrew, and Akkadian, the oldest known Semitic language, serve as excellent candidates for such comparative analysis.\nBiblical Hebrew and Akkadian share numerous features indicative of their common Semitic heritage. Their similarities provide invaluable insight into the Proto-Semitic language from which they both descended. For instance, both languages rely on a system of triconsonantal roots, wherein the meaning of a word is primarily determined by three consonants, and the specific nuances are shaped by altering vowels and adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes. This characteristic structure is a defining feature of the Semitic language family.\nAnother shared feature is the use of verb aspect, rather than tense, as the primary grammatical category. This means that these languages tend to express whether an action is ongoing or completed, rather than when it occurs.\nBiblical Hebrew and Akkadian also have similar phonetic properties, including the use of certain emphatic consonants, which further supports their common Semitic origin.\nBy comparing these similarities, linguists can extrapolate backwards to infer the properties of Proto-Semitic. And by extending the analysis to include other ancient Afroasiatic languages outside the Semitic family, they can even make inferences about the even more remote Proto-Afroasiatic.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note, however, that such reconstructions are based on probability and best-fit analyses, and absolute certainty is elusive. Furthermore, the task is complicated by language contact and borrowing, evolution and diversification of languages, and the limited availability of ancient written records. Despite these challenges, the comparative method remains one of the best tools we have for shedding light on the languages of the distant past.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh answers a series of questions that Raël got to ask. One of these questions aimed at what language was spoken among the Elohim themselves:\n‘What language do you speak on your planet?’\n‘Our official language closely resembles ancient Hebrew.’\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn this passage, the answer is short and to the point: the language spoken among the Elohimian civilization is one that has been spoken in the past on planet Earth, it is an ancient version of what we commonly refer to as Hebrew.\nOur take # If we assume that the first human beings during the Age of Leo or perhaps during the Age of Cancer were learning to speak with their Elohimian parent creators, they most likely conversed in a language that was already long established and formalized by their extraterrestrial civilization. We can\u0026rsquo;t know for sure from that short statement how close the actual source language has been to what we consider Biblical or Classical Hebrew. It could be that the antiquity of the language referred to as \u0026ldquo;ancient Hebrew\u0026rdquo; might refer to one of the ancestor languages, such as Proto-Semitic, Proto-Afroasiatic or an yet unexplored ancestor language.\nTable of common Biblical Hebrew words # Biblical Hebrew Meaning מַלְאָךְ (mal\u0026rsquo;ákh) Messenger, ambadassor, usually translated as angel Table of Semitic cognates # Cognates are words in different languages that share a common etymological origin.

This root carries the basic semantic meaning of the word. Different words are derived from this root by altering the vowels between the consonants and adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes. For example, in Hebrew, the root K-T-B conveys the concept of \u0026lsquo;writing.\u0026rsquo; By changing vowels and adding affixes, it can form words like \u0026lsquo;ketav\u0026rsquo; (script), \u0026lsquo;kotev\u0026rsquo; (writer), \u0026lsquo;kitvei\u0026rsquo; (writings), and \u0026lsquo;kotevet\u0026rsquo; (she writes), among others. The triconsonantal root system allows for a high degree of precision and nuance in Semitic languages.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe concept of \u0026ldquo;tense-aspect\u0026rdquo; in Semitic languages reflects the way these languages express both the time and the state of an action within their verb systems. \u0026ldquo;Tense\u0026rdquo; refers to when an action happens (past, present, future), while \u0026ldquo;aspect\u0026rdquo; describes the state of the action, whether it\u0026rsquo;s complete (perfective) or ongoing (imperfective). In languages like Hebrew, these two elements are interconnected rather than separate. A verb form in these languages doesn\u0026rsquo;t just express aspect or just express tense; instead, it conveys a combined \u0026ldquo;tense-aspect\u0026rdquo; that incorporates both temporal and aspectual information. For example, the Hebrew \u0026lsquo;qatal\u0026rsquo; form represents a past, completed action, while the \u0026lsquo;yiqtol\u0026rsquo; form can represent a future or present, ongoing action. This integration allows for a nuanced depiction of events, reflecting both when they happen and how they unfold.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSince the revival of Modern Hebrew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw influences from several European languages, German being one of them. This influence is especially noticeable in the realm of vocabulary, where Modern Hebrew has incorporated many loanwords from German. Other languages that have strongly influenced Modern Hebrew are Russian and Spanish.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Paleo-Hebrew script, used in the earliest forms of Hebrew, directly evolved from the Phoenician alphabet. This Phoenician script is one of the earliest alphabetic writing systems, believed to have originated from Egyptian hieroglyphs, transforming complex pictorial symbols into a simpler, more abstract and efficient phonetic system. The influence of the Phoenician script extended far beyond the Semitic world. The Greeks adapted the Phoenician script to their language, adding vowel symbols, and from there, it passed to the Etruscans, and then to the Romans. The Latin script, used in the majority of the world\u0026rsquo;s languages today, including English, evolved from this Roman adaptation, making the Phoenician script, and by extension the Paleo-Hebrew script, a distant ancestor of our modern alphabet.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe square script, also known as the Assyrian, Aramaic, or Jewish script, came into use around the 5th century BCE following the Babylonian exile, when Aramaic became the lingua franca of the region. Aramaic was written in this square script, and its use gradually spread to Hebrew as well.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":"93","href":"/resources/hermetica/","title":"Hermetica","description":"The Hermetica is a collection of texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who represents a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.

It encompasses a range of moral and ethical principles, values, and practices aimed at alleviating human suffering and promoting dignity, equality, and justice.\nIn todays usage # The modern concept of humanitarianism has its roots in the Enlightenment era and the development of humanitarian organizations during the 19th century, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. These organizations were established to provide assistance to civilians during times of armed conflict and to ensure that the rules of war were respected and upheld.\nHumanitarianism has since expanded to include a broader range of issues, such as natural disasters, health emergencies, poverty, and human rights abuses. Humanitarian organizations, such as United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations, work to provide life-saving assistance, protection, and support to people affected by crises and emergencies.\nHumanitarian actors operate under the principles of humanity, impartiality, independence, and neutrality. This means that their primary concern is the needs of those affected by crises, regardless of their race, religion, nationality, or political affiliation. Humanitarian assistance must also be provided without any discrimination and must not be used to further political or economic interests.\nHumanitarianism also involves advocating for the rights of people affected by crises and working to address the root causes of suffering and inequality. This can involve lobbying for policy changes, raising awareness of human rights abuses, and supporting local communities and organizations in their efforts to build resilience and improve their own well-being.\nL.

The book, which was written in Esperanto2, is a collection of essays and speeches that Zamenhof gave on the topic of humanism and its relationship to the Esperanto movement.\nIn the book, Zamenhof argues that humanism and humanitarianism should be at the core of the Esperanto movement, and that the language should be used as a tool for promoting these values. He asserts that Esperanto should serve as a means of bringing people together and fostering mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among individuals from different cultures and backgrounds.\nZamenhof also writes about the importance of the principles of equality and justice in the Esperanto movement, and emphasizes that the language should be used as a tool for promoting these values in society. He argues that Esperanto can help to break down barriers between people and promote peace and unity.\nFurthermore, Zamenhof writes about the role of the individual in promoting humanitarianism and humanism, and encourages readers to embrace these values in their personal and professional lives. He asserts that the principles of humanitarianism and humanism are essential for creating a better world, and that individuals have a responsibility to work towards this goal.\nIn conclusion, Homaranismo provides insight into Zamenhof\u0026rsquo;s thoughts on the concept of humanitarianism and its relationship to the Esperanto movement. The book highlights his belief in the importance of using Esperanto as a tool for promoting humanitarian values and fostering mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among people from different cultures and backgrounds.\nAny insult or oppression of a man because he belongs to another race, another language or another social class than me, I regard as barbaric.\nL. L. Zamehof in Homaranismo\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, Yahweh explores a way to handle Earthly economics which he tentatively named Humanitarianism. The first paragraph of the New Commandments called Humanitarniasm goes as follows:\nSecond point: Your world is paralyzed by profit, and Communism fails to provide a carrot big enough to motivate people and encourage them to make progress.\nYou are all born equal; this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that children of low intelligence should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their fathers, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.\nThis way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.\nThis world is not yours - that also is written in the Bible. You are only tenants. Thus all goods should be rented for forty-nine years.\nThis will eliminate the injustice of inheritance. Your true inheritance, and that of your children, is the entire world, if you knew how to organize yourselves to make it pleasant. This political orientation of humanity is not Communism; its preoccupation is the future of humanity. If you want to give it a name, call it \u0026ldquo;Humanitarianism\u0026rdquo;.\nThe passage discusses the problems with profit-driven societies and the limitations of communism. The author suggests that people should be born with similar financial means, and property ownership should be abolished without implementing communism. They propose that all goods should be rented for 49 years, which would eliminate the injustice of inheritance. The goal is not communism, but a political orientation focused on the future of humanity called \u0026ldquo;Humanitarianism\u0026rdquo;. The message is that people should work towards organizing themselves to create a more equitable and pleasant world.\nTake for example a man who has finished his studies at the age of twenty-one and wants to work. He chooses his profession and earns a salary. If he wants to find a place to live while his parents are still alive, he \u0026ldquo;buys\u0026rdquo; a house - but of course, in reality, he is renting a house or apartment for forty-nine years from the State which constructed it.\nIf the value of the house is estimated at 100,000 francs, he can pay that amount divided into monthly installments for forty-nine years.\nAt the age of seventy (twenty-one plus forty-nine), he will have paid for his house and can live there until his death, without ever paying again.\nAfter his death, the house will go back to the State, which must then allow his children, if there are any, to benefit from it freely.\nSupposing there is one child, then this child can live freely all his life in his father\u0026rsquo;s house. At his death, his child in turn can also benefit from the family house, and so on indefinitely. Inheritance must be completely abolished, except for the family house. This does not, however, prevent each person from being rewarded individually for their merits.\nLet us take another example. Someone has two children. One is a good worker, and the other is lazy. At the age of twenty-one, they both decide to go their own separate ways. They each rent a house worth 100,000 francs.\nThe worker will rapidly earn more money than the lazy one. He will then be able to rent a house worth twice as much as the first one.\nIf he has the means, he will even be able to rent both houses, one as a country house.\nIf his savings are fruitful, he will also be able to build a house and rent it for forty-nine years, thereby receiving money due to him. But at his death, everything will go back to the community, except for the family home, which will go to the children.\nThus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. To each their own merits.\nThe same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises. If someone creates a business, it is theirs for their entire life, and they can rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The same goes for farmers. They can rent land and cultivate it for forty-nine years, but after that, it all goes back to the State, which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.\nThis method must be adopted for all goods that remain exploitable, and as for the value of things, nothing changes. Everything that is of value such as shares, gold, enterprises, cash, or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for forty-nine years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits and labor.\nIn this way, somebody who made a fortune around the age of forty will be able to construct houses, rent them as apartments for forty-nine years, and enjoy that money so long as life lasts.\nAfterwards, the money, which comes from these rents, will go back to the community. This humanitarianism is already prescribed in the Bible:\nAnd thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.\n— Leviticus 25: 8.\nAnd if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour\u0026rsquo;s hand, ye shall not oppress one another: According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.\n— Leviticus 25: 14-16.\nThe land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.\n— Leviticus 25: 23.\nIf geniuses are admitted to power, they will understand the usefulness of these reforms. You must also see to it that all the nations of the Earth unite to form only one government.\nThe passage proposes a political system that goes beyond communism and capitalism, which aims to eliminate the injustice of inheritance and provide equal opportunities to all people. It suggests that all goods, including houses, commercial and industrial enterprises, and land, should be rented for 49 years from the State, and no individual should be allowed to own them permanently. Effectively, property ownership is abolished. After 49 years, the property goes back to the community. However, individuals can still accumulate wealth and make a fortune depending on their merits, but not for their children. The passage suggests that this system would promote equality and discourage the accumulation of wealth across generations. Yahweh asserts this system has already been described in the Bible, specifically in Leviticus 25:8, 14-16, and 23, which prescribe a jubilee year every 49 years when all slaves are freed, and all lands are returned to their original owners. The passage argues that it could be implemented if geniuses were in positions of power and all nations united under a single government.\nLeft-libertarianism and the Steiner-Vallentyne school # Left-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is a political philosophy that combines left-wing and libertarian ideas. It emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, while also advocating for social and economic equality.\nThe Steiner-Vallentyne school of left-libertarianism, named after philosophers Hillel Steiner and Peter Vallentyne, is particularly focused on the idea of a \u0026ldquo;property-owning democracy.\u0026rdquo; This concept holds that individuals have a right to control their own bodies and the fruits of their labor, but also have a responsibility to contribute to the common good through taxation.\nUnder this system, natural resources and land would be held in common and managed by the state for the benefit of all, rather than being owned by individuals. This would ensure that the benefits of resources and land are distributed fairly and that no one has the ability to use them in a way that would harm others or the environment.\nThe Steiner-Vallentyne school of left-libertarianism also emphasizes the importance of reducing poverty and inequality, and views the current economic system as being inherently flawed in this regard. They argue that the state should play a role in promoting equality and reducing poverty, through policies such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and collective bargaining rights for workers.\nIn conclusion, left-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is a political philosophy that combines the ideas of individual freedom and autonomy with social and economic equality. It envisions a society in which resources and land are managed for the benefit of all, and in which the state plays a role in promoting equality and reducing poverty.\nLeft-libertarians of the Steiner–Vallentyne type hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others. These left-libertarians support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources. Unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is only legitimate if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or if private appropriation is taxed to compensate those who are excluded from natural resources.\nLeft-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is related to Georgism and Freiwirtschaft as they all share some common ideas about property, taxation, and the role of the state in promoting equality and reducing poverty.\nGeorgism, named after Henry George, is a political and economic philosophy that holds that the value of land should belong to the community as a whole, and that individuals should only be able to own the improvements they make to the land. Georgists argue that this system would reduce poverty and increase economic efficiency by eliminating the unequal distribution of wealth and resources.\nFreiwirtschaft, as imagined by Silvio Gesell, is a school of thought that advocates for a form of monetary reform and a new economic system. Gesell believed that money should be treated as a public good and subject to similar rules as other goods, in order to promote fairness and reduce inequality. He argued that the current monetary system, which relies on interest-bearing loans, is inherently unjust and leads to poverty and inequality.\nWhile there are some similarities between left-libertarianism, Georgism, and Freiwirtschaft, each of these philosophies has its own distinct ideas and priorities. However, they all share a commitment to promoting equality and reducing poverty, and they all see the state as having a role to play in achieving these goals.\nHumanitarianism as a special case of Steiner-Vallentyne # The two passages quoted from the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, which describe a system of economics and property ownership that is based on the idea of renting rather than owning, are related to the ideas proposed by the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought in several ways.\nFirstly, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought reject the idea of private ownership of natural resources and advocate for their common ownership. The passages state that \u0026ldquo;everything that is of value such as shares, gold, enterprises, cash, or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for forty-nine years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits and labor.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought proposes that the Earth\u0026rsquo;s natural resources should be owned in common by all members of society.\nSecondly, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought reject the idea of inheritance, at least beyond the family home. The passages state that \u0026ldquo;inheritance must be completely abolished, except for the family house\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;after his death, everything will go back to the community, except for the family home, which will go to the children.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought argues that inheritance violates the principle of equality and should be limited in some way.\nFinally, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought advocate for a system of economic organization that is based on renting rather than owning. The passages propose that \u0026ldquo;all goods should be rented for forty-nine years\u0026rdquo; and that individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought argues that property should be held in common and that individuals should have the right to use and enjoy the fruits of their labor, but not to monopolize resources or accumulate wealth at the expense of others.\nSee also # Wiki › New Commandments\nExternal links # Humanitarnism | Wikipedia Homaranismo | Wikipedia Left-libertarianism #Steiner-Vallentyne school | Wikipedia Left-Libertarianism | Scholarly Community Encyclopedia Jubilee | Wikipedia Left-Libertarianism: A Primer by Peter Vallentyne (PDF) | umsystem.edu Steiner-Vallentyne School | Polcompball Wiki\nHomaranismo Declaration.

It conceptualizes infinity as an intrinsic aspect of both space and time, devoid of any central point, beginning, or end. Two ancient symbols known throughout the world and ages testify of this wisdom of old given to us by the Elohim, namely the Swastika representing the cyclical nature of time and timelessness, and Magen David representing in turn that what is above is below, meaning the way space expands to greater macrosopic levels is the same as the way the space within the microscopic levels folds down to. According to the Elohim, humanity's creators, these symbols reveal the intricate symmetry of the universe and advise us to contemplate our existence and actions concerning the individual, society, the creators, and infinity. In essence, infinity is not merely a cosmological concept but the fundamental basis to guide one's life to live in harmony with infinity.","content":"Infinity, an idea that has fascinated minds and found its place in various fields from mathematics to philosophy, refers to an endlessly extending concept, be it in terms of time, space, or quantity. Historically, this abstract notion has served as a cornerstone for various cosmological and philosophical systems, trying to understand and describe the nature of our universe. Today, in the realm of cosmology, it plays a pivotal role in discussions about the universe\u0026rsquo;s structure and extent, with its intricacies and implications continually shaping our understanding of the cosmos. From contemplating infinite time to pondering an infinite universe, the dialogue around infinity is a continuous exploration of our existence within the unfathomable vastness of reality.\nIn mathematics # Infinity, represented by the symbol $\\infty$, is a mathematical concept that extends beyond the largest finite number. It is not a conventional number, but rather represents the idea of an unbounded quantity. It has key applications in various branches of mathematics, such as calculus, set theory, and theoretical computer science.\nTwo distinct concepts of infinity in mathematics are \u0026lsquo;potential infinity\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;actual infinity\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Potential infinity\u0026rsquo; refers to a process that is unending, wherein quantities can continuously increase without limit. For instance, the series of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip;) can be extended indefinitely, embodying the concept of potential infinity.\n\u0026lsquo;Actual infinity\u0026rsquo;, on the other hand, is a completed totality of infinite quantity. An example is the set of all natural numbers, often denoted as $\\mathbb{N}$. Though it might seem counterintuitive, these concepts have proven invaluable in resolving mathematical paradoxes and in formalizing our understanding of mathematical structures.\nInfinity also appears in the study of limits in calculus. Consider the expression $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. These represent that as $x$ approaches zero from the positive or negative side respectively, the value of the function $\\frac{1}{x}$ tends towards positive or negative infinity.\nIt should be noted, however, that arithmetic with infinity does not follow the same rules as finite numbers. For example, adding or subtracting a finite number from infinity still results in infinity ($\\infty + 1 = \\infty$ and $\\infty - 1 = \\infty$).1\nMoreover, the concept of infinity is not confined to size alone, but also applies to divisibility. For example, there are infinitely many integers, but also infinitely many even integers. Seemingly, there should be twice as many integers as even integers, yet both are infinite. This is an example of \u0026lsquo;countably infinite\u0026rsquo; sets.\nIn mathematics, infinity is a fundamental concept. While it may sometimes seem paradoxical or counterintuitive, it is integral to a wide range of mathematical theories and is crucial to our understanding of the mathematical universe.\nHistorical perspective # The concept of an infinite universe has captured human imagination and intellectual inquiry for millennia. Among the ancients, varying views on the vastness of the cosmos emerged.\nIn Ancient Greece, the Atomist school, founded by Leucippus and Democritus and later expanded by Epicurus, proposed a boundless universe filled with infinite atoms moving in infinite space. Their view contrasted with that of other Greeks, such as Aristotle, who argued for a finite universe with Earth at its center.\nThe Roman poet Lucretius, a follower of Epicurean philosophy, also propagated the idea of an infinite universe in his philosophical poem \u0026ldquo;De rerum natura\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;On the Nature of Things\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the Renaissance, the Italian friar and philosopher Giordano Bruno was a prominent proponent of an infinite universe. Bruno\u0026rsquo;s radical ideas extended beyond spatial infinity; he even suggested the existence of a plurality of worlds. His visionary ideas, which challenged the religious and scientific views of his time, led to his execution as a heretic in 1600.\nDuring the Enlightenment, the concept of an infinite cosmos found proponents in philosopher Immanuel Kant and mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert, who made theoretical arguments for a universe without end.\nIn the 20th century, modern cosmology provided new tools to explore the question of infinity. The Steady State theory, popular in the mid-20th century, postulated an infinite, eternal universe with constant matter creation.\nHowever, the development of Big Bang cosmology, largely initiated by Belgian physicist and Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, transformed our understanding of the universe\u0026rsquo;s age. Lemaître proposed that the universe is expanding, a hypothesis that was later claimed to be confirmed by Edwin Hubble\u0026rsquo;s observations.\nDespite the groundbreaking nature of Lemaître\u0026rsquo;s theory, it initially faced skepticism, even from notable contemporaries like Albert Einstein. Einstein, who didn\u0026rsquo;t openly dispute Lemaître\u0026rsquo;s mathematical findings, reportedly remarked, \u0026ldquo;Vos calculs sont corrects, mais votre physique est abominable\u0026rdquo; (from French: \u0026ldquo;Your calculations are correct, but your physics is atrocious\u0026rdquo;). This skepticism would eventually yield to a broader questionable acceptance of an expanding universe, leading to the conception of a universe with a finite age.\nThe currently favored cosmological model — the ΛCDM model (pronounced Lambda-CDM model) — portrays a universe that is finite but unbounded, like the two-dimensional surface of an inflating balloon.\nNonetheless, the question of the universe\u0026rsquo;s infinity is far from settled. It remains a critical topic in our quest to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics, one of the grand challenges of theoretical physics.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In the first canonical book of Raëlism, The Book Which Tells The Truth (1973), a chapter entitled \u0026ldquo;Mankind: A Disease of the Universe\u0026rdquo; explores a conversation with Yahweh, an entity identified by the Raëlism philosophy as belonging to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization known as the Elohim. These beings are described as the creators of life on Earth, including humans. In this passage, Yahweh shares the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s understanding of their existence within the vast cosmos and their ongoing quest for knowledge.\nProgress continues, and our own research continues for the purpose of understanding and relating to the large being of whom we are a part, and on whose atoms we are parasites. These atoms are the planets and the stars.\nIn fact, we have been able to discover that intelligent living beings in the infinitely small live on particles that are planets and suns to them. They ask the same questions as ourselves.\nHumanity is a disease inside this gigantic being, and the planets and stars are its atoms. Also this same gigantic being is in its turn a parasite on other greater atoms. In both directions, it is infinite. But the important thing is to make sure that the disease, which is humanity, continues to exist and never dies.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe excerpt represents a profound reflection on the infinite nature of existence, as perceived by the Elohim. Yahweh describes their, but also the human civilization as parasites on the atoms, or in a cosmic sense, the planets and stars, of a larger being. This portrayal echoes the famous concept \u0026ldquo;as above, so below,\u0026rdquo; indicating that the same patterns are replicated at all levels of the cosmos, from the infinitely large to the infinitely small.\nYahweh reveals the discovery of microscopic, intelligent life forms living on particles that are, to them, analogous to our planets and suns, indicating the existence of infinite realms of life at varying scales.\nFurthermore, the passage characterizes humanity as a \u0026lsquo;disease\u0026rsquo; within this macroscopic entity, suggesting a symbiotic or even parasitic relationship. It also posits the infinite nature of existence in both micro and macro directions, creating an intriguing loop of nested realities.\nDespite this somewhat stark characterization, the overarching message is one of preservation and continuity of human life. The Elohim\u0026rsquo;s objective, as communicated by Yahweh, is to ensure the ongoing existence of humanity, reflecting an intriguing blend of existential introspection and cosmic awareness.\nIn the second canonical book of Raëlism, Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet (1976), Yahweh delves deeper into the profound theme of infinity, both in the spatial and temporal dimensions. This dialogue, a continuation of the revelations made in the first book, further expands on the Raëlian understanding of existence and life\u0026#39;s origins.\nWith regard to the origin of life on Earth, some people might say: “Your explanation doesn’t change a thing, since you cannot say what there was at the very beginning.”\nThis is a foolish comment, which proves that the person who makes it has no awareness of infinity, which exists in time as well as in space. There is neither a beginning nor an end to matter, since “nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed,” as you have already heard it said. Only the form of matter can change according to the wishes of those who have reached a scientific level, which allows them to accomplish this.\nIt is the same for the infinite levels of life. That is what the second part of our emblem represents. The Star of David, which is composed of two intertwined triangles, means “as above, so below.” With the swastika, which signifies that everything is cyclic, in the middle of a six-pointed star, you have our emblem, which contains all the wisdom in the world. You can also find the two symbols together in ancient writings like the Bardo Thodol or Tibetan Book of the Dead, and in many other writings as well.\nIt is evidently very difficult for a finite human brain to be conscious of infinity, which explains the need to limit the universe in time and space by belief in one or several gods that are made responsible for everything.\nIndeed, those who cannot reach a sufficient level of human understanding towards the universe have trouble accepting the notion of infinity, which makes humanity nothing exceptional, but merely people situated at a particular time and place in the infinite universe.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn this passage, Yahweh first addresses a common skepticism about the origin of life, noting that questions seeking a definitive beginning reveal a lack of understanding about infinity. Yahweh asserts the principle of conservation of matter, succinctly encapsulated in the phrase: \u0026ldquo;nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\u0026rdquo; This concept implies that the essence of existence has always been and will always be, only changing forms over time and space.\nThe emblem of Raëlism, represented by the intertwined triangles of the Star of David and the cyclical swastika, encapsulates this wisdom. It signifies \u0026ldquo;as above, so below,\u0026rdquo; suggesting a universal pattern repeating across all scales of existence, and cyclical time, reinforcing the idea of infinity.\nYahweh acknowledges the challenge posed by infinity to human understanding. Our finite minds tend to seek boundaries, often resorting to the concept of deities to explain the creation and regulation of the universe. This tendency underlines the difficulty in accepting the notion of infinity, which positions humanity as not exceptional, but merely a component in a specific time and place within an infinite universe.\nThe discourse thereby emphasizes the need for a heightened level of human understanding towards the universe, acknowledging our position within the cosmos and cultivating a deeper comprehension of infinity.\nInfinity in Space # The concept of an infinite universe in space represents the understanding that the universe has no edge, boundary, or center, extending indefinitely in all directions. This idea is inherently associated with the cosmological principle, a cornerstone of modern cosmology, which posits that the universe is isotropic (the same in all directions) and homogeneous (the same at all points) when observed on sufficiently large scales.\nEvidence supporting this concept is gleaned from numerous observations. The uniformity and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic from the universe\u0026rsquo;s early hot phase, strongly suggests an isotropic and homogeneous universe on large scales.\nMoreover, the vastness of the observable universe and the lack of detection of a distinct edge or boundary, despite our advancing technological prowess and expanding knowledge, bolsters the notion of an infinite universe. As our observational limits expand, the cosmos continues to exhibit a strikingly uniform and patterned structure, without discernible limits.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that asserting the universe\u0026rsquo;s spatial infinity with certainty remains a challenge. While cosmological evidence broadly supports the concept, the ultimate nature and geometry of the universe, and whether it indeed extends indefinitely or is somehow finite yet unbounded, is an ongoing subject of scientific investigation and debate.\nMagen David ✡ # The Magen David, also known as the Star of David, plays an important role in the understanding of infinity in space as conceptualized in Raëlism. Composed of two intertwined triangles, it signifies \u0026ldquo;as above, so below,\u0026rdquo; a philosophical principle suggesting that the same patterns are repeated at all scales of the cosmos, from the grandest celestial bodies to the smallest particles.\nIn the Raëlian cosmology, the Magen David represents the concept that the macroscopic (the universe at large) and the microscopic (particles and smaller scales) are mirror reflections of each other. This mirrors the fractal nature of the universe, which posits that self-similar patterns exist across different scales, tying into the theme of infinity in space.\nThe Raëlian emblem combines the Magen David with the swastika, another ancient symbol, to symbolize the cyclical nature of time and the interconnection of the macroscopic and microscopic levels of existence. These combined symbols encapsulate the Raëlian understanding of an infinite and cyclical universe.\nInfinity in Time # The concept of infinity in time posits that time, as a fundamental aspect of the universe, has always existed and will continue to do so indefinitely, devoid of a distinct beginning or end. This perspective, transcending the conventional human comprehension of time as linear and finite, provides a profound view of temporal existence in the cosmos.\nThis notion finds resonance in the fundamental principles of physics. The arrow of time, as understood in thermodynamics, supports the understanding of time as irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics, for instance, states that the entropy of an isolated system will always increase or remain the same over time. Entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness within a system, provides a one-way direction to time, with the past being distinguishably different from the future. This temporal asymmetry underscores the concept of an infinite and unchanging progression of time.\nThe universe\u0026rsquo;s definite history, as suggested by the progressive increase of entropy, testifies to the continuity and unidirectionality of time. Although our understanding of time continues to evolve, especially with the advent of quantum physics and theories like string theory, the concept of infinite time remains a profound element in our understanding of the cosmos.\nSwastika ࿕ # The swastika, an ancient symbol found in numerous cultures around the globe, plays a significant role in representing the concept of infinite time within the Raëlian philosophy. The swastika\u0026rsquo;s four arms, spinning around a central point, embody the cyclical nature of time. This symbol emphasizes the view of time not as a linear progression, but as a cycle that repeats indefinitely, capturing the concept of eternity.\nIn the context of Raëlism, the swastika is incorporated into their emblem, intertwining with the Star of David. This combination symbolizes the interconnectedness of the macroscopic and microscopic levels of existence, or the \u0026ldquo;as above, so below\u0026rdquo; principle, in tandem with the cyclical progression of time.\nThe emblem as a whole, therefore, encapsulates the Raëlian understanding of an infinite and cyclical universe in both spatial and temporal dimensions, with the swastika particularly highlighting the everlasting cyclical nature of time.\nLife above and below # The following excerpt from the second canonical book of Raëlism, \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet\u0026rdquo; (1976), sheds further light on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s understanding of life across the macroscopic and microscopic levels. It also introduces a key physical concept, the Law of Masstime, relating time\u0026rsquo;s flow to the mass or scale of a life form.\nYou also know that we have discovered that there is organized, intelligent life on the level of the infinitely small, quite certainly as evolved as we are and comparable to what we are ourselves. We have been able to prove this.\nFrom there, we have discovered that the stars and planets are the atoms of a gigantic being, which itself certainly contemplates other stars with curiosity. It is also highly likely that the people living on the infinitely small levels of the infinitely large person and his fellow creatures have known periods when they believed in an immaterial “God”.\nYou must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a “God” and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.\nTime is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\nThe Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.\nFinally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant. But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings.\nNo argument aiming to support the existence of any type of god or soul can be sustained when we glimpse, however briefly, at the infinite nature of the universe. No heaven could exist in any particular place because, since the universe is infinite, it cannot have a center. Besides, as I have already explained, there cannot be any communication between an infinitely large entity and a universe of infinitely small entities, because the difference in mass is too great, thus creating a difference in the flow of equivalent time.\nIn this passage, Yahweh conveys the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s discoveries of organized, intelligent life at the infinitely small scale, akin to their own advanced civilization. The stars and planets, according to this perspective, are atoms within a gigantic entity, implying a complex nested structure of existence, where everything is contained within everything else. He presents the concept of time as being inversely proportional to the mass or scale of the form of life - a fundamental principle they term the \u0026ldquo;Law of Masstime\u0026rdquo;, or simply \u0026ldquo;Mass Effect\u0026rdquo;. This idea dictates that what may be a millennium for humans could be equivalent to a single step for a cosmic entity, for whom the sun is but an atom.\nYahweh further emphasizes that all things in the universe, including the Earth, are alive and harmoniously connected across the infinitely large and infinitely small scales. However, he acknowledges the difficulty humans face in perceiving this universal life due to the immense difference in mass and associated time lag.\nThe passage concludes by arguing against the existence of any specific god or soul, given the infinite nature of the universe and its lack of a central point. Any interaction between infinitely large and infinitely small entities is deemed impossible due to the vast difference in mass and consequent discrepancy in the flow of time. The underlying message stresses the importance of living in harmony with the infinite dimensions of existence and fellow human beings for achieving happiness at our own level of existence.\nArtistic rendering titled \u0026ldquo;The Cosmic Web\u0026rdquo; by Volker Springel (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics) et al. \u0026ldquo;In shaping the Universe, gravity builds a vast cobweb-like structure of filaments tying galaxies and clusters of galaxies together along invisible bridges hundreds of millions of light-years long. This is known as the cosmic web.\u0026rdquo; The concept of the \u0026ldquo;vast difference in mass and consequent discrepancy in the flow of time\u0026rdquo; suggests that the experience of time is relative to the scale or mass of the observer. This is an idea presented in the Raëlian literature, coined as the Law of Masstime, though it\u0026rsquo;s not a principle that has been recognized nor validated by mainstream physics as of today.2\nThis law posits that a larger entity with a greater mass would experience time slower than a smaller entity with a lesser mass. For instance, for a cosmic entity so large that a star like our Sun is just an atom to it, what we perceive as a thousand years (a millennium) might only feel like a momentary step for that entity. This is due to the differences in the scales of existence - the cosmic entity exists at a much larger scale than humans. On the other side of the spectrum, at the microcosmic level where particles or atoms could represent entire worlds, time could be experienced at a much faster rate. A single moment for us could equate to entire epochs at that level.\nHarmony with infinity # In the last passage, the phrase, \u0026ldquo;Finally, whatever happens to each individual, the universal balance remains constant,\u0026rdquo; suggests a worldview that recognizes the natural order or balance of the universe, irrespective of individual experiences or circumstances. It encapsulates a belief in the inherent equilibrium of existence, with the universe maintaining its balance regardless of what transpires at the individual level. This could be interpreted as a statement about the relative insignificance of individual actions, experiences, or existence in the face of the grandeur and scale of the universe.\nThe following statement, \u0026ldquo;But if we want to be happy at our level, we must live in harmony with the infinitely large, the infinitely small, and with our fellow human beings,\u0026rdquo; offers a prescription for contentment or happiness. It posits that to achieve happiness, one must strive for a state of harmony with all aspects of existence: the macroscopic (\u0026ldquo;infinitely large\u0026rdquo;), the microscopic (\u0026ldquo;infinitely small\u0026rdquo;), and the interpersonal (\u0026ldquo;our fellow human beings\u0026rdquo;).\nThe \u0026ldquo;infinitely large\u0026rdquo; could refer to the grand scale of the universe and our place within it, while the \u0026ldquo;infinitely small\u0026rdquo; could be interpreted as the minuscule, yet complex, elements that make up our world, such as atoms or even subatomic particles. Recognizing and appreciating our connection and relationship to both of these scales of existence is suggested as a pathway to happiness.\nLastly, the reference to living in harmony with \u0026ldquo;our fellow human beings\u0026rdquo; suggests the importance of empathy, compassion, mutual understanding, and cooperative living. It implies that our relationships with others—how we treat them and how we allow ourselves to be treated—are crucial components of our overall well-being and happiness.\nThese statements together present a holistic approach to happiness that encompasses a comprehensive understanding of our place in the universe, from the grandest cosmic scale to the minutiae of atomic structures, along with the importance of human connection and community.\nThis is a cosmological simulation of the distant universe (2021). The image shows the light emitted by hydrogen atoms in the cosmic web in a region roughly 15 million light-years across, using astronomical data gathered by the The Very Large Telescope (VLT), a facility operated by the European Southern Observatory, located on Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. In the Raëlian philosophy, as elaborated in their second canonical book \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet\u0026rdquo; (1976), a specific guidance is provided on how to perceive and assess situations. This guidance is expressed through the Four Levels of Consideration:\nIn every situation, we must always consider things in regard to four levels:\nIn relation to infinity;\nIn relation to the Elohim, our parents and creators;\nIn relation to human society;\nAnd finally, in relation to the individual.\nThe most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged - but always with one constant factor: love. This means taking others into account, who must be given love, because we must live in harmony with infinity, and to do this we must live in harmony with others, because they are a part of infinity as well.\nRaëlism instructs its adherents to approach every situation considering four distinct levels: 1) in relation to infinity, 2) in relation to the Elohim, who are conceived as humanity\u0026rsquo;s creators, 3) in relation to human society, and 4) in relation to the individual. The highest significance is ascribed to the level concerning infinity, as all things are to be judged in relation to it. However, one universal constant transcends all these levels: love.\nThis guidance posits that to fully grasp any situation, one must take into account its implications on the vast scale of the infinite cosmos, on our creators (as per Raëlian belief), on society, and on the individual. To exist in harmony with infinity, which includes everyone and everything, it advocates living with love and consideration for others. Thus, the approach endorses a cosmically aware perspective imbued with empathy and compassion, viewing all life as an integral part of the grandeur of infinity.\nSee also # Wiki › Mass effect Wiki › Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki › Star of David Wiki › Swastika\nExternal links # Infinity | Wikipedia\nThe idea of infinity is also prevalent in the realm of calculus, particularly when discussing limits. Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation, and the concept of limits is a fundamental part of it. Consider the mathematical expression $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. The \u0026rsquo;lim\u0026rsquo; part stands for limit, the \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; is the variable we\u0026rsquo;re interested in, and the \u0026lsquo;0^+\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;0^-\u0026rsquo; are indicating that we\u0026rsquo;re looking at what happens when \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; gets very close to zero from the positive side and the negative side, respectively. Think about it as a thought experiment. What happens if you keep dividing 1 by smaller and smaller positive numbers? As the numbers you divide by become tiny, but stay just above zero (like 0.1, then 0.01, then 0.001, and so on), the result of the division keeps getting larger and larger. That\u0026rsquo;s what we mean by $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}\\frac{1}{x}=\\infty$ - as \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; gets very, very close to zero from the positive side, 1 divided by \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; grows without bound. It tends towards infinity. On the flip side, if you divide 1 by smaller and smaller negative numbers (like -0.1, then -0.01, then -0.001, and so on), the results of your division become larger and larger negative numbers. This is expressed as $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\infty$. As \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; approaches zero from the negative side, 1 divided by \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; tends towards negative infinity. This is a fundamental aspect of how infinity works in calculus, encapsulating the intuitive idea that dividing by smaller and smaller amounts results in larger and larger (or more and more negative) outcomes.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe theory of general relativity, the widely accepted framework in physics for understanding gravitation, also suggests time dilation effects due to gravity and velocity differences, but it does not make claims in the same manner as the Law of Masstime as laid out here.

Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that the complexity and apparent design found in the natural world provide evidence of a supernatural designer, often referred to as a \u0026ldquo;intelligent agent,\u0026rdquo; that is responsible for the creation and development of life.\nIntelligent Design differs from traditional creationism, which asserts that the universe and all life were created by God in six literal 24-hour days, in that it does not make specific claims about the identity or nature of the intelligent agent responsible for the design in the natural world.\nIntelligent Design has been the subject of much controversy and criticism, particularly in the scientific community. Critics argue that ID is not a scientifically valid explanation for the natural world, as it does not provide testable hypotheses or make predictions that can be verified through empirical observation. Additionally, ID is often seen as a political and religious movement rather than a scientific theory, and many have argued that its ultimate goal is to introduce religious concepts into science classrooms.\nAs a result of these criticisms, Intelligent Design is not widely accepted in the scientific community and is not taught as a scientific theory in public schools. However, it continues to be a topic of discussion and debate among scientists, philosophers, and religious scholars.\nWatchmaker Analogy # Most arguments in favour of Intelligent Design can be summarized with the Watchmaker Analogy. The Watchmaker Analogy, also known as the Argument from Design, is often used to support the idea of Intelligent Design. The argument goes as follows: if we come across a watch, we can deduce that it was designed by an intelligent watchmaker rather than being formed randomly by natural forces. In the same way, when we look at the complexity of living organisms, we can deduce that they were designed by an intelligent creator.\nProponents of this argument argue that the complexity of biological organisms, such as the intricate machinery of the cell, the genetic code, and the intricate ecosystems, cannot be explained by random chance or natural selection alone. Instead, they suggest that an intelligent creator must have designed life as we know it.\nCritics of the Watchmaker Argument argue that it is flawed because it assumes that complexity is evidence of design, and that natural processes are not capable of producing complex structures. They also argue that it is difficult to prove the existence of an intelligent creator, and that attributing the complexity of life to such a creator only raises further questions about the creator\u0026rsquo;s origins and design.\nSome more specific arguments that have been put forward in favor of Intelligent Design:\nIrreducible complexity: Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that certain biological systems are irreducibly complex, meaning that they could not have arisen through natural selection alone. They point to complex biological structures like the human eye or the bacterial flagellum as examples of structures that cannot be explained by evolution alone. They argue that the existence of such structures is evidence of intelligent designers.\nThe complexity of biological systems: Advocates of Intelligent Design argue that biological systems such as DNA, cellular structures, and biochemical pathways are too complex to have arisen solely through natural processes. They argue that such complexity is more easily explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nThe fine-tuning of the conditions for life: Advocates of Intelligent Design point to the fine-tuning of physical constants such as the cosmological constant and the strength of gravity that allow for the existence of life. They argue that such fine-tuning is unlikely to be the result of chance and is instead evidence of design.\nThe origin of genetic information: Advocates of Intelligent Design argue that the origin of genetic information in the first living organisms is difficult to explain through natural selection and random mutation alone. They suggest that the complexity of the genetic code and the mechanisms of gene expression are better explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nInformation layer: Another argument related to the previous entry of the origin of genetic information is the complexity of the information layer found in living organisms. DNA, for example, is a complex code that contains information about an organism\u0026rsquo;s traits and functions. It has been argued that the level of complexity and specificity of this information cannot be attributed to purely natural processes, and that an intelligent designer is the best explanation for this phenomenon. Proponents of intelligent design argue that the information contained in DNA and other biological systems is evidence of a purposeful design, rather than a result of random chance or natural selection.\nThe sudden appearance of major groups of organisms in the fossil record: Some advocates of Intelligent Design argue that the sudden appearance of major groups of organisms in the fossil record without clear evolutionary precursors is evidence of design. They argue that this pattern is inconsistent with gradual evolutionary change and more easily explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nAbiogenesis: The origin of life from non-living matter has yet to be fully explained by naturalistic processes. Despite numerous attempts, scientists have not been able to recreate the conditions and processes that would lead to the formation of a living organism from inorganic matter. The complexity and sophistication of even the simplest living cell suggest that it was not the result of chance or natural processes, but rather the product of intelligent design.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In Raëlism, the concept of intelligent design is seen in the context of the Elohim, who are believed to be the extraterrestrial creators of humanity. The Elohim are highly advanced beings who possess a deep understanding of science and technology, and they used this knowledge to create humans using genetic engineering.\nWithin the scope of Intelligent Design, the notion of \u0026ldquo;directed design\u0026rdquo; as presented in Raëlism can be seen as a subtype. In this case, the intelligent cause is not an omnipotent deity or a metaphysical force but a succession of scientifically advanced civilizations. These civilizations, starting from the Forerunners, deliberately and consciously manipulate biological processes to create and improve life forms.\nThis \u0026ldquo;directed design\u0026rdquo; shares the common core belief of Intelligent Design that an intelligent cause is responsible for the complexity and diversity of life. However, it provides a unique twist by assigning this role to physically and scientifically advanced entities rather than a spiritual or divine being.\nIn the case of Raëlism, the directed design further extends to propose a lineage of creators, each civilization passing on its acquired knowledge and enhancements to the next, creating a chain of cosmic evolution. It\u0026rsquo;s a model that combines elements of both creation and evolution, attributing the origins and progression of life to the purposeful actions of advanced civilizations.\nSee also # Wiki › Cosmic evolution Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Forerunners Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Life engineering Read more # Intro › Intelligent Design Resources › The Book Which Tells The Truth External links # Intelligent Design | Wikipedia Intelligent Design | Britannica "},{"id":"97","href":"/resources/internet-sacred-text-archive/","title":"Internet Sacred Text Archive","description":"The Internet Sacred Text Archive (ISTA), founded by John Bruno Hare in 1999 in Santa Cruz, California, is a website dedicated to preserving electronic public domain religious texts.

This form of creation science challenges established scientific facts regarding the origins of the universe, Earth, solar system, and life itself, advocating for a literal interpretation of the biblical narratives. The film posits that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days and supports the Genesis accounts of Adam and Eve, the fall, a global flood, and the Tower of Babel.\nDel Tackett, the creator of \u0026ldquo;The Truth Project,\u0026rdquo; narrates the film, which features interviews with thirteen creationists who argue that the Genesis account represents real historical events. Other notable speakers in the film include George Grant, Paul Nelson, Marcus R. Ross, Andrew A. Snelling, Kurt Wise, and Larry Vardiman in the bonus features. The inspiration for the film came after Purifoy\u0026rsquo;s daughter watched the Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate in 2014, which spurred questions about the creation-evolution controversy​.\nThe film was released in American theaters on February 23, 2017, and it was shown in 704 theaters. This debut made it the highest-grossing film in the United States that night. A special anniversary screening took place on February 22, 2018, in approximately 850 theaters, featuring a bonus scene with Wheaton College students touring the Ark Encounter, a creationist attraction. This event sparked controversy among the faculty of Wheaton College, most of whom reject the historical creationism narrative presented in the film​.\nThe documentary features over a dozen scientists and scholars explaining how the world intersects with the history recorded in Genesis. It covers a range of topics, including paradigms, created kinds, the fossil record, DNA, transitional forms, historical views on evolution, ecosystems, the global flood, starlight, the Tower of Babel, the Big Bang theory, rock layers, genealogies, isotope dating, and beauty. The film aims to address the question of whether the biblical account of creation and the flood should be understood as historical events, and whether the world provides evidence of recent creation and a catastrophic flood​​.\nMany of the scientists and scholars featured in the film view Genesis as key to understanding the world around us, having spent decades in their respective fields exploring its relationship to the history recorded in the Bible​.\nSynopsis # \u0026ldquo;Is Genesis History?\u0026rdquo; is a documentary film that delves into the debate between traditional scientific theories about the origins of the universe, Earth, and life, and the Young Earth creationism perspective, which interprets the Genesis account of creation as literal historical fact. The film is structured around a series of interviews and explorations conducted by Dr. Del Tackett, the creator of \u0026ldquo;The Truth Project.\u0026rdquo; Tackett travels to various locations, including landscapes like canyons, mountains, and underwater environments, to investigate and present evidence that supports the Young Earth creationist viewpoint.\nThe film features over a dozen scientists and scholars from various fields who argue in favor of the creationist interpretation. These experts discuss a wide range of topics to support their views:\nParadigms: The film examines different frameworks of understanding the world, contrasting the mainstream scientific paradigm with the creationist view. Created Kinds: It discusses the concept of \u0026ldquo;kinds\u0026rdquo; as described in Genesis, in opposition to the theory of evolution. Fossil Record: The documentary explores the fossil record, arguing that it supports the idea of a global flood rather than gradual geological processes. DNA and Transitional Forms: It examines genetic evidence and the absence (as claimed in the film) of transitional forms in the fossil record. Historic Views on Evolution and Ecosystems: The film addresses historical perspectives on evolution and the complexity of ecosystems. Global Flood and Starlight: It presents arguments for a global flood and discusses astronomical evidence. Tower of Babel and Big Bang: The film covers biblical events like the Tower of Babel and contrasts the Big Bang theory with creationist beliefs. Rock Layers and Genealogies: It examines geological formations and biblical genealogies to argue for a young Earth. Isotope Dating: The film critiques isotope dating methods used in establishing the age of the Earth. Beauty: The documentary also delves into the concept of beauty in the natural world as evidence of intelligent design. The overarching goal of \u0026ldquo;Is Genesis History?\u0026rdquo; is to make a compelling case for the creationist view of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s and universe\u0026rsquo;s origins, challenging established scientific theories and interpretations. The film asks whether the biblical account of creation and the flood can be understood as real history and whether the evidence in the natural world supports this view​.\nSee also # Graham Hancock\u0026#39;s Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth\u0026#39;s Lost Civilization External links # Ancient Apocalypse | Wikipedia "},{"id":"99","href":"/wiki/jesus/","title":"Jesus","description":"Jesus Christ, a Jewish prophet who existed at the end of the Second Temple period and is the main protagonist of the Gospels.

According to Christian belief, Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea in the 1st century BC and was crucified in Jerusalem by the Romans around 30 AD.\nJesus is considered by Christians to be the Son of God and the Messiah (or savior) prophesied in the Old Testament. He is believed to have lived a sinless life, performed many miracles, and taught about God\u0026rsquo;s love and the coming of the Kingdom of God.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; teachings, as recorded in the Gospels of the New Testament, have had a profound impact on Western civilization and continue to shape the lives of millions of people today. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, Jesus made it possible for people to have a relationship with God and be forgiven of their sins.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; life and teachings are central to the Christian faith, and he is worshipped as Lord and Savior by Christians around the world.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; life # Jesus\u0026rsquo; life and teachings are recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. According to the Gospels, Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea to Mary and Joseph, and was baptized by John the Baptist.\nAfter his baptism, Jesus began a ministry of preaching and healing that lasted about three years. He traveled throughout Galilee and Judea, teaching about God\u0026rsquo;s love and the coming of the Kingdom of God, and performing miracles such as healing the sick, casting out demons, and feeding the hungry.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; teachings and miracles caused controversy among the religious leaders of his day, who saw him as a threat to their power and status. He was eventually arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion.\nAfter his death, Jesus\u0026rsquo; followers claimed that he had risen from the dead and appeared to them, providing evidence of his divine nature and fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. The accounts of his resurrection form the foundation of the Christian faith and the belief in eternal life.\nThroughout his ministry, Jesus emphasized God\u0026rsquo;s love and the importance of loving one another. He also taught about the need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins, and offered a message of hope and salvation to all who believe in him. The life and teachings of Jesus continue to inspire and influence people around the world to this day.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Jesus is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with Raël. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, showcases the mentioning of Jesus:\nChrist\u0026rsquo;s role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything. The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:\nShe was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\n— Matthew 1: 18.\nMary was the woman chosen, and obviously her fiance found these tidings hard to accept, but:\nBehold, the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him.\n— Matthew 1:20.\nOne of the creators appeared to explain that Mary would bring forth a son of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;. The prophets, who were in contact with the creators, came from very far away to see the divine child. One of the spacecrafts of the creators guided them:\nWe have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him\u0026hellip; the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\n— Matthew 2: 2 and 9.\nThe creators watched over the child:\nThe angel of Yahweh appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.\n— Matthew 2: 13.\nThe king was not too happy about the child-king coming from the people on his territory, which was announced to him by the prophets. But after King Herod died, the creators told Joseph that he could return to Israel:\nBut when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of Yahweh appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child\u0026rsquo;s life.\n— Matthew 2: 19-20.\nAccording to Raëlian belief, Christ\u0026rsquo;s role was to spread the truth of biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when science would eventually explain everything. The creators decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of Earth and one of their own people who would inherit certain telepathic faculties that humans lack. Mary was chosen as the woman, and an angel of Yahweh appeared to her fiance to explain that she would bring forth a son of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;. The prophets, who were in contact with the creators, came from far away to see the divine child, and one of the spacecrafts of the creators guided them. The creators watched over the child and told Joseph to flee to Egypt until King Herod died, after which they told him to return to Israel.\nThen Jesus told his apostles that they must spread the truth throughout the world. In the prayer called the \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Our Father\u0026rdquo;, the truth is stated literally:\nThy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n— Matthew 6: 10.\nIn \u0026ldquo;heaven\u0026rdquo;, on the creators\u0026rsquo; planet, the scientists eventually became the ruling group and then created other intelligent beings.\nThe same thing will happen on Earth. The torch will be taken up again.\nThis prayer, which has been repeated time and time again without anyone understanding its profound meaning, now takes on its full significance: On Earth, as it is in heaven.\nIn this passage, Jesus tells his apostles to spread the truth throughout the world, and the prayer known as the \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer\u0026rdquo; includes the statement \u0026ldquo;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\u0026rdquo; The text suggests that on the creators\u0026rsquo; planet, the scientists eventually became the ruling group and created other intelligent beings, and this same pattern will be followed on Earth. The passage emphasizes the profound meaning of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer and the idea that Earth will become like heaven. It also suggests that the same will happen on Earth, and the prayer\u0026rsquo;s message will take on its full significance when the truth is realized on Earth.\nIn St. Matthew\u0026rsquo;s Gospel, Chapter 26, Jesus reveals the importance of his death and of the writings, which would later serve as proof. When one of his companions tried to defend him with a sword, he said:\nPut up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\n— Matthew 26: 52-54.\nIt was in fact necessary for Jesus to die in order for the truth to be known throughout the world so that later on, when your creators return to Earth, they are not taken for usurpers or invaders. That is the purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings: to preserve traces of the work and presence of your creators, so that they will be recognized when they return.\nIn St. Matthew\u0026rsquo;s Gospel, Chapter 26, Jesus explains the importance of his death and the writings that will serve as proof. He emphasizes the need for him to die to ensure that the truth is known throughout the world, and to prevent the creators from being taken for invaders or usurpers when they return to Earth. The purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings is to preserve traces of the creators\u0026rsquo; work and presence, so that they can be recognized when they return.\nThe creators took care of Jesus and revived him. And he said:\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations\u0026hellip; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\n— Matthew 28: 19-20.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; mission was coming to an end:\nSo then after Jesus16 had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven.\n— Mark 16: 19.\nThe creators took him away after this last most important phrase:\nThey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n— Mark 16: 18.\nThis refers to humanity discovering anti-venom serums and antidotes, and developing surgery and so on — as is happening now.\nIn preparation for their arrival on Earth, the creators will appear more and more frequently, in order to highlight these revelations.\nThis also is happening right now.\nBehold the fig tree\u0026hellip; When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.\n— Luke 21: 29-30.\nWhen unidentified flying objects begin appearing in large numbers, as they are doing at present, it means that the time has come. In the Acts of the Apostles, it says, furthermore, in Chapter 2:\nAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues\u0026hellip;\n— Acts 2: 1-4.\nTo make it possible for the apostles to spread the truth throughout the world, the creators exposed them to a concentrated burst of teaching sent to them by amplified telepathic waves, a little like electro-shocks, which impregnated their memories with elements of other languages.\nIn this passage, it is explained that Jesus\u0026rsquo; mission on Earth was to spread the truth of the creators and to prepare humanity for their return. After his resurrection, Jesus commanded his apostles to teach all nations and observe his teachings. Jesus was then taken away by the creators after sharing important revelations about the progress of humanity. The passage states that the creators will appear more frequently to highlight their revelations and that the increase in UFO sightings is a sign that their arrival is approaching. The apostles were exposed to a concentrated burst of teaching, which impregnated their memories with elements of other languages to make it possible for them to spread the truth throughout the world.\nSee also # Wiki › Abraham Wiki › Bible Wiki › Moses Wiki › World Age Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Pisces External links # Jesus | Wikipedia Jesus | Britannica Jesus Christ | World History Encylopedia "},{"id":"100","href":"/resources/jurassic-world/","title":"Jurassic World","description":"Jurassic World is a 2015 American science fiction adventure film and the fourth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise.

Directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Trevorrow, Derek Connolly, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, the film is set 22 years after the events of the original Jurassic Park and takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s Pacific Coast.\nIn Jurassic World, the island has been transformed into a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. The story follows the park\u0026rsquo;s operations manager, Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, and a velociraptor trainer, Owen Grady, portrayed by Chris Pratt. The plot thickens when a genetically engineered dinosaur, the Indominus rex, breaks loose and causes chaos across the park. The film explores themes of corporate greed, ethical responsibility in genetic engineering, and humanity\u0026rsquo;s relationship with nature.\nJurassic World was a major box office success, grossing over $1.6 billion worldwide, and received generally positive reviews for its visuals, action sequences, and Pratt\u0026rsquo;s performance. It revived the franchise after a 14-year hiatus and was followed by sequels Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and Jurassic World: Dominion in 2022, continuing the story of human encounters with genetically resurrected dinosaurs in a rapidly changing world.\nCommon themes # At the core of both narratives is the theme of genetic engineering and its potential for catastrophic outcomes. Jurassic World vividly portrays the dangers of human hubris in scientific pursuits, particularly in the creation of the genetically modified Indominus rex, which ultimately wreaks havoc. This mirrors the Wheel of Heaven’s emphasis on the repercussions of humans playing God through genetic manipulation, echoing the cautionary tale of unchecked scientific progress.\nAnother significant thematic strand is the creation and manipulation of new life forms. The Wheel of Heaven website delves into the concept of visionary scientists pushing the boundaries of genetics to create new species, a scenario that unfolds tragically in \u0026ldquo;Jurassic World.\u0026rdquo; The film\u0026rsquo;s narrative illustrates the unpredictable and often perilous consequences of such endeavors, resonating with the website\u0026rsquo;s skepticism towards the unchecked creation of life.\nAdditionally, the intersection of genetic engineering with other advanced technologies, such as space exploration, forms a compelling thematic link. Jurassic World subtly hints at this through the dialogue about the profitability of space programs, suggesting a future where various fields of advanced technology evolve in tandem. This notion aligns with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s broader perspective on the parallel development of genetic engineering and space travel, underscoring the multifaceted nature of scientific advancement.\nThematic scenes from the movie # The following excerpts from Jurassic World, are noteworthy, illustrating the film\u0026rsquo;s depiction of advanced genetic engineering and its concurrent development with space exploration, reflecting key themes in contemporary scientific endeavors.\n\u0026ldquo;She was DESIGNED.\u0026rdquo; # In this pivotal scene from Jurassic World, the dialogue between Claire, Osterly, Drucker, and Dr. Henry Wu encapsulates several central themes that resonate deeply with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration of science, ethics, and the allure of discovery.\nClaire\u0026rsquo;s introduction of the Indominus Rex as the park\u0026rsquo;s first genetically modified hybrid underscores the audacity of human ingenuity in bending natural laws to meet commercial desires. This moment reflects the website\u0026rsquo;s focus on the ethical implications of genetic engineering, where the pursuit of thrills and commercial success overshadows the profound responsibility that comes with creating life.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOSTERLY: We wanna be thrilled.\nCLAIRE: Oh, but don\u0026rsquo;t we all?\n[She slides her finger across the screen and a DNA double helix reacts. Claire steps forward proudly.]\nCLAIRE: May I present you\u0026hellip; the Indominus Rex. Our first genetically modified hybrid.\n[Drucker looks dubious.]\nDRUCKER: How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to\u0026hellip;\n[He struggles with how to put it, and makes awkward \u0026ldquo;doing it\u0026rdquo; motions with his hands.]\nDRUCKER: Y\u0026rsquo;know\u0026hellip;\n[He trails off uncertainly. DR. HENRY WU walks over to the group, smiling.]\nWU: Oh, Indominus wasn\u0026rsquo;t bred. She was DESIGNED. She will be fifty feet long when fully grown. BIGGER than the T. rex.\nCLAIRE: (to the investors) Every time we\u0026rsquo;ve unveiled a new asset, attendance has spiked. Global news coverage. Celebrity visitors. Eyes of the world.\n— Excerpt from the transcript, chapter \u0026ldquo;Hammond Creation Lab\u0026rdquo;\nDrucker\u0026rsquo;s reaction, mingled with skepticism and curiosity, mirrors our collective bewilderment at the possibilities and dangers of genetic manipulation. His struggle to articulate the process of creating such a creature highlights the often incomprehensible complexity behind such scientific feats, a theme prevalent in the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s narrative.\nDr. Wu\u0026rsquo;s assertion that the Indominus Rex was \u0026ldquo;designed\u0026rdquo; rather than bred is particularly telling. It suggests a shift from traditional notions of natural evolution to a new era where life is engineered to specification. This aligns with the website\u0026rsquo;s thematic exploration of the power and perils of playing God, emphasizing the profound implications of such scientific advancements.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Like the Space program\u0026rdquo; # In this succinct yet impactful scene from Jurassic World, Claire\u0026rsquo;s comparison of the park\u0026rsquo;s need for constant innovation to the space program encapsulates a significant theme that aligns closely with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration: the simultaneous advancement of life creation technologies and space exploration.\nThe construction crews are on break as Claire and Owen get out of the car. Owen stares up at the towering walls, looking unconvinced and more than a little uneasy.\nCLAIRE We\u0026rsquo;ve been pre-booking tickets for months. The park needs a new attraction every few years in order to reinvigorate the public\u0026rsquo;s interest. Kinda like the space program.\nShe walks over to the flight up steps leading up to the observation tower. Owen follows.\n— Excerpt from the transcript, chapter \u0026ldquo;Indominus Wrecks\u0026rdquo;\nClaire\u0026rsquo;s reference to pre-booking and the public\u0026rsquo;s craving for new attractions draws a parallel between the creation of genetically engineered dinosaurs and the grandeur of space travel. This dialogue succinctly reflects the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s focus on a unique period in human history where the ability to design and resurrect life converges with the meaningful exploration of space. This convergence symbolizes a pivotal moment in human capability, marked by extraordinary technological feats in both biological and astronomical fields.\nThe scene, in its brevity, highlights the critical intersection of these two realms of human achievement, underscoring the profound implications of this dual advancement for our understanding of life, space, and our place in the universe.\nSee more # Intro › Preamble Wiki › Intelligent Design Wiki › Life Engineering External links # Jurassic World Film Transcript | Jurassic Wiki "},{"id":"101","href":"/wiki/kabbalah/","title":"Kabbalah","description":"Kabbalah (קַבָּלָה) literally meaning 'tradition' is a school of thought of Jewish mysticism.

The classic texts of Kabbalah, such as \u0026ldquo;The Book of Creation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Zohar,\u0026rdquo; were written in the late 12th to early 14th centuries.\nThe main books of Kabbalah include:\n\u0026ldquo;Sefer Yetzirah\u0026rdquo; (Book of Creation) \u0026ldquo;The Zohar\u0026rdquo; (Book of Splendor) \u0026ldquo;The Bahir\u0026rdquo; (Book of Brightness) \u0026ldquo;Etz Chaim\u0026rdquo; (Tree of Life) \u0026ldquo;Sefer Ha-Razim\u0026rdquo; (Book of Mysteries) \u0026ldquo;Sefer Ha-Hezyonot\u0026rdquo; (Book of Visions) Some of the most well-known and influential Kabbalistic texts were written by Spanish Kabbalists such as Moses de Leon (who is credited with writing \u0026ldquo;The Zohar\u0026rdquo;), Isaac Luria (known as the Ari), and Shlomo Alkabetz. Other important figures in the development of Kabbalah include the German Kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin and the 16th-century Safed school of Kabbalists led by Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria. Kabbalah is still considered an important part of Jewish spirituality and culture by many Jews today. Its teachings and practices continue to influence contemporary spirituality and have inspired new interpretations and adaptations in various spiritual traditions. Additionally, Kabbalah has had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, literature, and the arts. While it is primarily a form of Jewish mysticism, its ideas and practices have also been adopted and studied by individuals from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.\nThe Zohar # The Zohar is a central text in the Kabbalah. It was written in medieval Spain in the 13th century and is said to contain the secret wisdom of the Torah. The Zohar is written in Aramaic and is a commentary on the Torah, the Hebrew Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament).\nThe Zohar\u0026rsquo;s central teaching is that God\u0026rsquo;s essence is not fully revealed in the physical world and that only through mystical contemplation and study can one truly understand the divine. It teaches that the universe was created through ten sefirot, which are emanations of God\u0026rsquo;s attributes and energy.\nThe Zohar is structured in the form of a running commentary on the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. It takes the form of a dialogue between the mystics Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his disciples, who discuss and interpret the meaning of various verses and passages in the Torah.\nIn addition to the commentary on the Torah, the Zohar also contains homilies, parables, and allegories that elaborate on its central teachings. The text is divided into several sections, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the divine realm, such as the sefirot (the ten attributes of God), the creation of the world, and the nature of the soul.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his book The Coming of the Gods, in a subchapter about \u0026ldquo;Rationalism and the Tradition\u0026rdquo;, Jean Sendy writes the following about the origins and meaning of the Kabbalah:\nRationality is what will made it possible to send men to the moon, to prepare to send men to Mars, to consider dispersing the opaque clouds under which Venus is hidden, to send \u0026ldquo;the spirit of man\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;move upon the face of the waters\u0026rdquo; under which Venus is \u0026ldquo;without form, and void,\u0026rdquo; and to prepare the methods and means that may some day bring it to pass that there will \u0026ldquo;be light\u0026rdquo; on Venus also.\nAre we on the verge of \u0026ldquo;renewing the acts related at the beginning of Genesis?\u0026rsquo; It would seem so, judging from what leading scientists and technicians believe and say. But scientists and technicians do not necessarily read the Bible or practice the Cabala, that \u0026ldquo;oral teaching\u0026rdquo; for which the Bible is the equivalent of a detailed outline intended to help students understand a college lecture course.\n\u0026ldquo;The message preserved by the Cabala concerns the correspondence between the two worlds, celestial and earthly, and their unification by man. [\u0026hellip;] Man will renew the acts related at the beginning of Genesis,\u0026rdquo; writes Alexandre Safran, Grand Rabbi of Geneva, in La Kabale (Payot), where he also states that \u0026ldquo;the Cabala goes back to prehistoric times; Moses only introduced it into the history of Israel.\u0026rdquo;\nIs it only a coincidence, this conjunction between science and the Cabala whose roots go back into the depths of time common to the myths of all the First Civilizations? Is it more rational to see it is a fulfilment of the \u0026ldquo;prophecy\u0026rdquo; that the Cabala describes as having been brought \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo; by the \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; Whose acts are related in the Bible, as was known by every man with a little education in Voltaire\u0026rsquo;s time?\nSome of our most renowned scientists are already seeking beyond the solar system for concrete evidence of other civilizations, whose existence seems to them probable enough to justify their efforts. [\u0026hellip;]\nHere, Sendy first argues that rationality and science have allowed humans to explore and study the cosmos, and that some scientists and technicians are beginning to believe in the possibility of life on other planets. Sendy then goes on and speculates by quoting the Grand Rabbi of Geneva Alexandre Safran that the connection between science and the Kabbalah may not be a coincidence, and that the Kabbalah\u0026rsquo;s description of \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; bringing their knowledge from the sky and renewing the acts related to the beginning of Genesis may actually be a prophecy that science is fulfilling.\nAccording to Alexandre Safran # As stated before Jean Sendy refers several times throughout his work to Alexandre Safran. In doing so he highlights the circumstance that a leading figure in the Jewish community such as Alexandre Safran was identifying the Kabbalistic tradition that preserved Elohimian wisdom over the ages that goes back further than Moses and his Jewish religion itself.\nAlexandre Safran (1915-2006) was a Romanian-Swiss rabbi and scholar who served as the Chief Rabbi of Geneva and the Chairman of the Executive of the World Jewish Congress. He was a prominent figure in the Jewish community and worked to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding between different religious groups. Safran was particularly interested in the Kabbalah and its role in Jewish mysticism, and he wrote several books on the subject, including \u0026ldquo;The Mysteries of the Kabbalah\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Kabbalah and the Spiritual Quest\u0026rdquo;.\nSendy often refers to Alexandre Safran, the Grand Rabbi of Geneva, who himself authored a treatise named \u0026ldquo;La Cabale\u0026rdquo; and got published in 1960. Therein, the very nature of the Kabbalah as a tradition is explained. A famous quote from Alexandre Safran that is found throughout Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work refers to an important passage in \u0026ldquo;La Cabale\u0026rdquo; where Kabbalah is thought to preserve the notion that man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis:\nThe Kabbalah creates values inspired by the Bible because it contains vital biblical forces upon which its existence and flourishing depend. It calls these forces to the surface, where they appear in their biblical originality despite the \u0026ldquo;clothes\u0026rdquo; they assume to act better in a given historical environment. The message offered by the Kabbalah concerns the correspondence of the two worlds, celestial and earthly, and their unification by man: they will be merged and form a unique world. This message is delivered in the \u0026ldquo;history of the heavens and the earth\u0026rdquo; and in the \u0026ldquo;history of man,\u0026rdquo; who \u0026ldquo;struggles\u0026rdquo; against the \u0026ldquo;forces of below\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;forces of above\u0026rdquo; to make the ideal that was instilled in him triumph: Israel.\nThanks to the victory of man, the descriptive natural history, the result of the original sin, will give way to a creative and transformative history of nature. The latter will then be put at the service of ethics and \u0026ldquo;generate\u0026rdquo; the good deeds of the renewed man, aided in his task by all creatures. \u0026ldquo;Ze sefer toldòth adàm,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;this is the story of man\u0026rsquo;s genealogy.\u0026rdquo; In its messianic edition, this account will be identified with the toldòth ha-shamàim ve-ha-arez, the \u0026ldquo;genealogy of heaven and earth,\u0026rdquo; for they too, like man, will have their toldòtb, their \u0026ldquo;genealogy,\u0026rdquo; their history in accordance with the Creator\u0026rsquo;s will. Such was the plan established \u0026ldquo;when the Eternal God made the heavens and the earth,\u0026rdquo; but also \u0026ldquo;on the day He created man\u0026rdquo; (Gen).\nIn the messianic edition of these toldòth, \u0026ldquo;the wolf and the lamb\u0026rdquo; will be seen dwelling together in a creative peace in which material strength is put at the service of moral good. Man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis.\nAlso, the following passage from the same book contextualizes the Kabbalah even further as a chain of Tradition:\nAt the root of the Kabbalah, there is a first Revelation. But this Revelation must be renewed for every generation, for every man, who leads it to acts whose scope is very great, reaches cosmic dimensions, and even engages divinity. They determine God\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the world and with man.\nThe Mishnah provides the historical outline of the Kabbalah in this way: \u0026ldquo;Moses received (kibbev: from this term derives Kabbalah) the Torah, the Teaching, the Law) on Mount Sinai; he transmitted it (Hu-mesara) to Joshua; he passed it on to the Elders; they communicated it to the prophets, and the latter transmitted it to the members of the Great Congregation.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Kabbalah exceeds, in antiquity, the Revelation of Sinai; it dates back to prehistoric times. Moses only introduced it into the history of Israel.\nThe Kabbalah therefore goes beyond the boundaries of a religious mystique; it is infinitely more extensive than an esoteric tradition. The Torah is not its precise and extensive object. The latter was, from the beginning, applied by those who had discovered it thanks to their religious intuition and only later received its written form, the Mosaic Law. Israel has become its bearer. The designation commonly attributed to Kabbalah is shalshelet ha-Kabbalah or \u0026ldquo;chain of Tradition.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Kabbalah can therefore be understood as a chain of tradition that extends beyond the boundaries of a religious mystique and dates back to prehistoric times, which has been transmitted to different generations and engages divinity to determine God\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the world and with man.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Fifth Chapter \u0026ldquo;The End of the World\u0026rdquo;, Section \u0026ldquo;At the Roots of All Religions\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh mentions the Kabbalah as being a body of mystical traditions that is rich in allusions to our Creators, the Elohim:\nIt is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.\nIf one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. [\u0026hellip;]\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another passage that worthwhile to point out. It can be considered to resonate with what Jean Sendy has been suggesting through the interpretation and exegesis by the Grand Rabbi of Geneva Alexandre Safran of the essence of Kabbalah, namely that that the Kabbalah is ultimately about preserving the notion that man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis:\nFor a long time, humanity has held the truth in its hands but could not understand until it was sufficiently evolved scientifically to decode it.\nEvery man is brutish in his knowledge15\u0026hellip; Jeremiah 10: 14.\nScience enabled the creators to create and will enable human beings to do the same.\nYahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was\u0026hellip; When he prepared the heavens, I was there\u0026hellip; When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment\u0026hellip; Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. Proverbs 8: 22-23, 27, 29 -31.\nIntelligence and science, these are the two virtues that enabled the creators to create the landmass - the single continent - and the living beings they placed upon it. And now this intelligence and this spirit leads the human brain to repeat the acts of their creators. Since the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:\nThat which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. Ecclesiastes 3: 15.\nThe animals were also created and will be recreated. Just like human beings, no more, no less. The species that disappear will live again when you know how to recreate them:\nSo that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. Ecelesiastes 3: 19.\nSee more # Wiki › Bible Wiki › The Tradition Read more # Resources › The Zohar: Pritzker Edition External links # Kabbalah | Wikipedia Zohar | Wikipedia Cabala | Jewish Encyclopedia Zohar | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"102","href":"/resources/kitab-i-aqdas/","title":"Kitáb-i-Aqdas","description":"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, known as \"The Most Holy Book,\" is the central book of the Bahá'í Faith, written by Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the faith.

In the Bible, the Leviathan is described as a powerful and fearsome creature that lives in the sea and is difficult to control.\nThe Leviathan has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. In some interpretations, it is seen as a symbol of chaos and evil, while in others it is viewed as a symbol of the power of God and the natural order of the universe. In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, the Leviathan is often associated with the idea of a great, apocalyptic battle between good and evil, in which God will defeat the monster and restore order to the world.\nIn popular culture, the Leviathan has been depicted in many different ways, often as a giant sea serpent or dragon. It has also been used as a metaphor for various forms of evil, oppression, and tyranny throughout history. The image of the Leviathan continues to hold great cultural and symbolic significance, and it is often referenced in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture.\nEtymology # The term Leviathan originates from the Hebrew word לִוְיָתָן (livyāthān), which appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in several books, including Job, Psalms, and Isaiah. This term is often used to denote a large sea creature or monster.\nThe root of the word לִוְיָתָן (livyāthān) is believed to be derived from the Hebrew verb לוה (lāvāh), which means \u0026ldquo;to twist\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to coil\u0026rdquo;, which could be a reference to the creature\u0026rsquo;s serpentine or coiling nature.1\nSea serpent in mythology # The depiction of multi-headed creatures, while unusual in biological terms, often finds representation in mythology and heraldry. Dragons with multiple heads, such as the 8-headed Orochi (大蛇) and 3-headed Trisiras, emerge frequently across various cultures. Greek mythology also tells of Heracles\u0026rsquo; battles against the 9-headed Lernaean Hydra and the 100-headed Ladon.\nThe number eight in such folklore tends to imply a sense of multiplicity or variation. Furthermore, narratives often feature gods or kings using dragons, particularly multi-headed ones, as their mode of transportation. These tales share common threads with legends across Cambodia, India, Persia, Western Asia, East Africa, and the Mediterranean region.\nThere is a recurring theme across mythologies involving a storm god battling a sea serpent. This concept, termed chaoskampf (German for \u0026ldquo;struggle against chaos\u0026rdquo;)2, symbolizes the ongoing conflict between order and chaos. As these myths develop, the role of the storm god (often the leader of a pantheon) is frequently assumed by culture heroes or figures emblematic of royalty.\nThis motif appears in the battles between Thor and Jörmungandr in Norse mythology, Perun and Veles in Slavic mythology, Zeus and Typhon in Greek mythology, and others. A common variant of this theme involves a hero (often of extraordinary birth) confronting a dragon that demands the sacrifice of maidens or princesses. This type of narrative is ubiquitous and classified under the Aarne–Thompson–Uther index as ATU 300, \u0026ldquo;The Dragonslayer\u0026rdquo;.3\nApollo vs. Python (Greek): Python was a serpentine dragon in Delphi and was slain by Apollo. This myth symbolizes the establishment of the oracle at Delphi. Baʿal vs. Yam (Canaanite): Yam, the deity of the sea, represented chaos and was defeated by Ba\u0026rsquo;al, the storm god, marking the triumph of order. Benzaiten vs. Gozuryu (Japanese Buddhism): Benzaiten, a goddess of everything that flows, defeated the dragon Gozuryu, affirming the importance of maintaining balance. Dobrynya Nikitich vs. Zmey Gorynych (Slavic): The heroic knight Dobrynya defeated the three-headed dragon Zmey Gorynych, embodying the triumph of courage over fear. Drangue vs. Kulshedra (Albanian mythology): The semi-human Drangue battled the dragon-like creature Kulshedra to protect people and maintain balance in the world. Făt-Frumos vs. Balaur (Romanian): Făt-Frumos, a prince, defeated the dragon Balaur to save the princess, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.

Chaoskampf, or the war in space # The term Chaoskampf is derived from the German words \u0026ldquo;chaos\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;kampf\u0026rdquo;, meaning struggle or battle. Chaos on the other hand originates from the Greek word χάος (kháos). Similarly to the Ancient Hebrew term תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ (ṯōhū wā-ḇōhū)4, kháos referres not so much to disorder or entropy as it does in the contemporary understanding, but rather to the vast, empty space that existed before the creation of the universe.5\nIn ancient Greek cosmogony, Khaos was the primeval state of existence from which the first gods emerged. It represented the gap between heaven and earth, or more accurately, the gap that existed before heaven and earth were separated. This chasm, void, or limitless space is what was embodied by the term \u0026ldquo;Khaos\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen referring to \u0026ldquo;chaoskampf\u0026rdquo; in mythological terms, it is then a reference to the struggle that takes place within this primordial space or void. While it has come to symbolize the battle between order (represented by gods or heroes) and chaos (often embodied by multi-headed serpents or dragons), it could indeed be seen metaphorically as conflict amongst gods in the vast expanse of space.\nThis interpretation provides a different perspective on the concept, especially considering ancient astronaut theories and narratives that describe gods as extraterrestrial beings. In such contexts, the \u0026ldquo;chaoskampf\u0026rdquo; could very well represent real or metaphorical conflicts taking place in the cosmos, amongst beings who traverse or inhabit different worlds.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim came to hide in the oceans:\nThe creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nIn that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\n— Isaiah 27: 1.\nAt that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.\nThe Leviathan is the group of scientists led by Lucifer, also known as the Serpent, who had been banished at the outset and had hidden themselves in the oceans, and according to Isaiah 27:1, the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans. This suggests a deep-seated conflict among the Elohim, a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Lucifer led the faction, also known as the Serpent, that defied the ruling authority by having transferred technological knowledge to the early human beings known as the Adamites, which resulted in their exile.\nAfter the Great Flood, this Serpentine faction concealed themselves in the oceans. The waters served as a protective shield, providing a sanctuary against their adversaries led by Yahweh. The reference to Isaiah 27:1 metaphorically encapsulates this power dynamic, wherein Yahweh seeks to punish the \u0026lsquo;Serpent in the sea\u0026rsquo;, embodying the Leviathan or the exiled group.\nThe root cause of this cosmic contention was the Serpentine faction\u0026#39;s rebellion, manifested in their act of creating human beings and interbreeding with the Adamites on Earth. This act was perceived as a grave transgression by Yahweh and his allies, who feared that the descendants of these unions could pose a significant threat to their home planet. Consequently, they desired to annihilate the rebel faction, which instigated the unfolding of this Elohimian space conflict.\nSee also # Wiki › Comparative mythology Wiki › Elohimian Space Wars Wiki › Serpentine rebellion Wiki › Lucifer Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Gemini External links # Leviathan | Wikipedia Compound of לִוְיָה (livyá, \u0026ldquo;garland, wreath\u0026rdquo;) and -תָּן (-tan, agentive suffix), meaning \u0026ldquo;the tortuous one\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;twisting one\u0026rdquo;.

The exact individual who first used it is difficult to determine, as it emerged out of the academic tradition of German philology and mythology studies during this period. It is associated with scholars such as Hermann Gunkel, Heinrich Zimmer, and Walter Burkert, who contributed to the study of mythological patterns across different cultures. They applied the term to a variety of mythological narratives, drawing parallels between them and highlighting the common theme of a struggle between order and chaos. It is thought that the motif of Chaoskampf originated in the ancient Near East and later transmitted into the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, potentially starting with the Proto-Indo-European religion. The earliest known examples come from ancient Sumer and Babylon, with the conflict between the storm god and the sea serpent, such as the Babylonian myth of Marduk and Tiamat, and the Hittite myth of Tarhunt and Illuyanka.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system is a system used by folklorists to categorize and classify folktales from around the world. It was first developed by Antti Aarne in the early 20th century, later revised by Stith Thompson, and most recently updated by Hans-Jörg Uther. The system groups folktales based on similar plot patterns and themes, and assigns each type a number for easy reference. ATU 300, or \u0026ldquo;The Dragonslayer\u0026rdquo;, refers to a type of folktale where the hero, often of extraordinary or mysterious birth, must face and overcome a dragon or a similarly dangerous beast. This beast often requires regular sacrifices, usually maidens or princesses, and the hero must find a way to slay the creature and end the sacrifices. Examples of this tale type can be found in many cultures and mythologies, and include famous tales such as Saint George and the Dragon, Siegfried and the dragon Fafnir from the Nibelungenlied, and the tale of Beowulf and the dragon in the Old English epic Beowulf. The tales can vary widely in detail, but the central theme of a hero overcoming a dangerous beast remains consistent.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOn a side note, \u0026ldquo;Tohu wa-bohu\u0026rdquo; is a Biblical Hebrew term that appears in the creation narrative in Genesis (Genesis 1:2). It is used to describe the state of the Earth (\u0026lsquo;aretz) just before light was created in Genesis 1:3. The word \u0026ldquo;Tohu\u0026rdquo; (תוהו) is understood to mean \u0026lsquo;desolation,\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;nothingness,\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness,\u0026rsquo; while \u0026ldquo;Bohu\u0026rdquo; (בוהו) signifies \u0026lsquo;void\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness.\u0026rsquo; Therefore, the combined phrase \u0026ldquo;Tohu wa-bohu\u0026rdquo; conveys a sense of absolute emptiness, void, or a state of nothingness, a concept that mirrors the Greek word \u0026ldquo;khaos\u0026rdquo; (χάος) which also denotes a \u0026lsquo;vast void\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness.\u0026rsquo; Thus, both terms, although from different languages and cultural contexts, reflect similar concepts of primordial emptiness or void, a state of formless existence preceding creation, something that we call today \u0026ldquo;outer space\u0026rdquo;.

Close encounters can range from simply observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky to experiencing physical contact with an alien being. The idea of close encounters has been a subject of fascination for many people, particularly those interested in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\nOne example of a close encounter is the event in 1460 BC when the Nubians were defeated by what was described as a \u0026ldquo;falling star\u0026rdquo;. While it is possible that this could have been a natural phenomenon such as a meteor, some have suggested that it could have been a visitation from extraterrestrial beings. Similarly, the biblical stories of the abduction of Elijah and Ezekiel have been interpreted by some as close encounters, with the descriptions of strange flying vehicles and beams of light being cited as evidence.\nAnother example of a close encounter is the story of Akhenaton\u0026rsquo;s flying disk, which is said to have been seen by the pharaoh Akhenaton in ancient Egypt. According to the story, Akhenaton witnessed a disk-shaped object that emitted a bright light and had the ability to hover in the air. Some have suggested that this was a close encounter with an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\nWhile close encounters are often dismissed as mere legends or hoaxes, there are many reported cases of such events that remain unexplained. Witnesses to these events often report experiencing intense fear or awe, as well as a sense of profound spiritual or mystical significance.\nIn some cases, close encounters have been associated with alleged sightings of UFOs or other unidentified flying objects. These sightings have been reported all over the world, and many have been captured on video or in photographs. However, the scientific community generally remains skeptical of the existence of extraterrestrial life, and most sightings of UFOs are attributed to natural phenomena or human-made objects such as aircraft or weather balloons.\nDespite this skepticism, the idea of close encounters remains a subject of fascination for many people. Whether they are the result of actual visitations from extraterrestrial beings or simply the products of human imagination, stories of close encounters continue to capture the imagination and inspire wonder and curiosity about the mysteries of the universe.\nList of close encounters # The following table shows the majority of close encounters that have been reported since antiquity:\nEncounter Year Location Description A \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo;

An extensive enumeration of known megalithic sites that more or less clearly feature the fingerprints of advanced architectural building qualities.","content":"Megalithic sites are large, ancient structures constructed from massive stone blocks that were often used for religious or ceremonial purposes. These structures date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, and are found in various parts of the world.\nOne of the most famous megalithic sites is the Baalbek temple complex, located in modern-day Lebanon. The complex features a massive stone platform and three enormous stone blocks, known as the Trilithon, which weigh an estimated 800 tons each. The stones were transported from a quarry several miles away, and their precise placement and alignment is a testament to the advanced engineering and construction techniques of the ancient world.\nAnother well-known megalithic site is the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, which includes the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, and other smaller pyramids and tombs. The Great Pyramid is one of the largest megalithic structures in the world, consisting of more than 2 million stone blocks, some weighing as much as 80 tons. The precision with which the stones were cut, moved, and placed has led to much speculation about the methods and tools used by the ancient Egyptians.\nThe Gunung Padang site in Indonesia is another megalithic site that has gained attention in recent years. It consists of several layers of stone terraces and structures, some of which may date back to 20,000 years ago. The site has been the subject of extensive archaeological research, with some theories suggesting that it was a site of astronomical observation and/or energy harnessing.\nMachu Picchu, the famous Incan city in Peru, is also considered a megalithic site due to its impressive stonework and complex layout. The city features numerous temples, palaces, and terraces, all constructed from massive stone blocks that were cut and shaped with great precision.

By the agency of exploring the premises put forward by Wheel of Heaven, there are a number of mythemes and mythological motifs that can be read via the working hypothesis interpretation. This list os going to catalogue the majority of these motifs.","content":"Mythemes, also known as mythological motifs, are the recurring themes, symbols, and patterns found in myths and legends from various cultures throughout history. They represent the fundamental building blocks of myths, and can be observed in stories from diverse regions and times. These mythemes can range from the concept of a hero’s journey to the use of certain animals to represent specific qualities or ideas.\nOne example of a prominent mythological motif is the Creation myth, which explains the origins of the world, the universe, and human life. Creation myths can take many forms and can be found in many cultures, such as the Babylonian Enuma Elish or the Judeo-Christian Genesis. These myths often involve a supreme being or beings that create the world and all life within it through supernatural means, such as speaking it into existence or molding it out of clay.\nAnother well-known mythological motif is the flood myth, which can also be found in many cultures and traditions. This motif typically involves a catastrophic flood that destroys most of the world, and often leads to the creation of a new world or the rebirth of humanity. Examples of flood myths can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu story of Manu, and the biblical story of Noah and the ark.\nOne of the most fascinating mythological motifs is that of the creators from the sky, or from above. These stories involve the arrival of beings from another world who impart knowledge, technology, or culture to humans. These creators are often depicted as powerful, advanced beings with god-like abilities, and can be found in myths from various cultures, such as the Sumerian Anunnaki, the Greek Titans, or the Hindu Devas. The stories of the creators from the sky have led many to speculate that they were actually extraterrestrial beings, who came to Earth and interacted with humans in the distant past.\nList of mythemes and mythological motifs # The following table shows the majority of well-established, well-known mythemes and mythological motifs that exhibit mythological readings that can be explained within the Wheel of Heaven working hypothesis:\nMotif Motif-Index Myth(s) Reading Serpent-slaying battle Zeus vs. Typhon (Greek) Thor vs. Jörmungandr (Norse) Baʿal vs. Yam (Canaanite) Marduk vs. Tiamat (Babylonian) Ra vs. Apep (Egyptian) Quetzalcoatl vs. Cipactli (Aztec) Yu the Great vs. Xiangliu or Gong Gong (Chinese) Benzaiten vs. Gozuryu (Japanese Buddhism) Lac Long Quan vs. Ngu Tinh (Vietnamese mythology) Victory over the Elohimian Serpent (Leviathan) Creation of man from clay Genesis 2:7 (Judeo-Christian) Qur\u0026rsquo;an 23:12 (Islamic) Enki and Enlil (Sumerian) Khnum (Egyptian) Genetic engineering of mankind with basic source chemicals Creation myth Creator from above A21 Flood myth A10XX Primordial chaos Sky father A210 Theft of fire A1415 Titanomachy See also # Wiki › Mytheme External links # Motif-Index of Folk Literature | Wikipedia "},{"id":"112","href":"/wiki/list-of-prophets-and-religions/","title":"List of prophets and religions","description":"List of prophets and religions.

It is not a proper name, but a metaphorical term for the role of bringing light. The name Lucifer and its Semitic counterpart hêlēl both refer to the morning star, Venus, which rises before the sun at sunrise","content":"Lucifer is a name that is often associated with the Devil or Satan, although its original meaning and interpretation have changed over time. The name Lucifer comes from the Latin word \u0026ldquo;Lucifer,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;light-bringer.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the Bible, the name Lucifer is first mentioned in the book of Isaiah, where it is used to describe the King of Babylon as a fallen angel who was once a bright star but was cast down to hell because of his pride and sin. Lucifer believed by many Christians to have been a powerful angel who rebelled against the Elohim and was cast out of heaven.\nEtymology # In Latin, the term Lucifer translates to light-bringer or morning star, originating from the Latin words \u0026ldquo;lux\u0026rdquo; meaning light and \u0026ldquo;ferre\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;to bring or carry\u0026rdquo;. The term was originally used to refer to the planet Venus, which is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon and often appears just before dawn.\nThe Hebrew term הֵילֵל בֶּן-שָׁחַר (Hêlêl ben Šāḥar) is found in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Isaiah. It is typically translated as \u0026ldquo;son of the morning\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son of the dawn\u0026rdquo;. Helel means \u0026ldquo;shining one\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bright one\u0026rdquo;, while ben Shachar translates to \u0026ldquo;son of dawn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son of morning light\u0026rdquo;. Much like Lucifer, this name was associated with the planet Venus, due to its brightness and appearance in the early morning sky. These names have often been connected with mythological and religious figures associated with light, pride, or rebellion.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and helped humanity in their early stages of development. The following is said about him:\nThen came Lucifer, which means “light bearer”. Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth, thus created Man. Lucifer was heading a small group of scientists working in one of the genetic engineering laboratories which studied the behavior of the first synthetic men. Noticing the extraordinary aptitudes exhibited by their creation, Lucifer decided to overrule the order and reveal to these first humans that those whom they had mistaken for “Gods” where in fact men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material. Lucifer, and the Elohim who followed him, felt love and affection for their synthetically created humans. They started to love these beings as their own children - these beings that they studied all day long, who were obliged to look upon them as “Gods”.\nLucifer, “the bearer of light”, enlightened the first men when he revealed that the creators were not “Gods” but men like themselves. This attitude is directly opposed to that of Satan who thinks that only evil can be expected from men, and also to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim’s planet.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the “serpent” to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the “Garden of Eden” where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.\nThe passage describes the story of Lucifer, one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and Man, and his decision to reveal to the first humans that their creators were not gods but flesh-and-blood men from another planet who came in flying machines. This act of enlightenment is said to be in opposition to Satan, who believes only evil can come from men, and to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet. As a result of their disobedience, Yahweh condemns the scientists to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth, and evicts Man from the \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo; laboratory where they were taken care of without effort.\nBut when Lucifer’s group learns that their fabulous creation is soon to be destroyed, they decide that they cannot allow that. They still feel very strongly that among men there are some who are positive and non- violent, full of love and fraternity. Among these was Noah whom they helped build a space craft which would protect him from destruction, by staying in orbit around the earth. This craft contained a few men and women and the genetic codes of some animal species, which would be used to re-create them after the cataclysm. It was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer’s group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the “ark”.\nSatan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will “self-destroy” when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.\nIn this passage, it is explained that Lucifer and his group, who were scientists that created the first humans, reveal to these humans that the creators were not gods, but rather flesh and blood beings from another planet who came in flying machines. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group feels affection for their creations and decides to protect them from the destruction of the impending cataclysm by helping Noah build a space craft containing humans, animals, and genetic codes to recreate life after the cataclysm. The Elohim, who created humanity, realize that they too were created in the same manner and decide to never again destroy humanity. Meanwhile, Satan believes that humans are inherently evil, but Yahweh and the majority of the council of the Eternals believe otherwise, and they understand that if humans are violent, they will self-destruct when they reach an interplanetary level of civilization.\nAccording to the excerpts, Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and who headed a group of scientists that studied the behavior of the first synthetic humans. He felt love and affection for these humans, and decided to reveal to them that their creators were men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material.\nLucifer\u0026rsquo;s role, according to the excerpts, was to bring light and knowledge to the first humans, and to teach them about the true nature of their creators. His actions were opposed by Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, who condemned Lucifer and his group to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. However, despite this punishment, Lucifer and his group continued to care for and protect humanity, including helping Noah and his family to escape the cataclysmic flood by building a space craft to protect them.\nSee also # Wiki › Satan Wiki › Yahweh Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Raëlism Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Cancer External links # Lucifer | Wikipedia Lucifer | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"114","href":"/wiki/mass-effect/","title":"Mass effect","description":"Mass effect, or alternatively the law of masstime, is a hypothetical law of physics where time appears to move more slowly for larger and more complex systems than for smaller and simpler ones. The law hasn't been mathematically formalized yet, but derives all of its predictable ability from empirical obversations.","content":"Law of masstime # The law of masstime simply states that time is inversely proportional to mass.\nThis effect of mass, or simply mass effect, or the law of physics where time is inversely proportional to the mass or level of form of life, is a universal law that can be observed empirically in a wide range of kinetic bodies, particularly in life forms. For example, a eukaryotic cell exhibits a higher degree of gesticulations in a given period of time relative to its body size compared to an ant, which, in turn, generates more kinetic activity than an elephant.\nThis law holds true at all levels of existence, from the smallest living organisms to the largest celestial bodies, and has profound consequences for understanding the behavior of the universe as a whole. For instance, a planet that is smaller than a galaxy would be expected to have a higher degree of motion due to its smaller mass, and would thus complete its revolutions in a shorter period of time. Similarly, a galaxy that is smaller than a supercluster would have a higher degree of motion relative to its size, and would complete its rotations in a shorter period of time.\nThis universal law implies that everything in the universe is interconnected and operates in harmony, with each level of existence influencing and affected by every other level.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In Chapter 2 \u0026ldquo;Neither God Nor Soul\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh says the following about the perception of time:\nYou must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.\nTime is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\nThe Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.\nThe passage explains that everything in the universe is interconnected, and that there are many worlds being born and dying within an atom in your arm at this very moment. Time is inversely proportional to the mass or level of form of life, and everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and small. The Earth is alive like all planets, but humanity finds it difficult to perceive this because of the time lag caused by the enormous difference in mass. The passage concludes by stating that one red blood cell or atom in our body couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine that it forms part of a larger living being.\nOur take # If time is inversely proportional to the mass or level of form of life, then it means that time passes differently for different beings or entities in the universe. For example, a being with a larger mass or a higher level of form of life would experience time passing more slowly than a being with a smaller mass or a lower level of form of life.\nThis has interesting implications for our understanding of time and the universe as a whole. It suggests that time is not a fixed and uniform concept, but rather varies depending on the observer. It also implies that there may be beings or entities in the universe that experience time very differently from us, which could have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of the universe and the possibilities for life beyond our own planet.\nAdditionally, the idea that everything is in everything implies a deep interconnectivity and interdependence between all things in the universe. This means that everything we do and every decision we make can have far-reaching consequences that affect the entire universe, whether we are aware of it or not. It also suggests that there is a fundamental unity underlying all of existence, which can be a source of wonder and inspiration for those who contemplate it.\nSee also # Wiki › Infinity "},{"id":"115","href":"/resources/mazzaroth-dot-com/","title":"Mazzaroth | The Alpha and the Omega","description":"Jim A.

She suggests that these symbols were used to educate spiritually, connecting the constellations with divine truths and prophetic messages. According to her, these signs were known before the corresponding biblical prophecies were written, thus indicating their ancient origin and divine inspiration.\nRolleston also discusses how the zodiac signs and the twelve tribes of Israel are interconnected, with each tribe represented by a specific constellation. She believes that this connection further solidifies the idea that the constellations are more than mere astronomical figures, but rather, carry a deeper, spiritual message.\nThe book explores how different cultures and civilizations, including the Chinese, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Arabs, Brahmins, Greeks, and Romans, have acknowledged the constellations, attributing their knowledge and understanding to earlier sources, often linked with biblical figures like Noah and Abraham.\nAbout Frances Rolleston # Frances Rolleston (1781-1864) was an English scholar, author, and theologian who is best known for her work on biblical symbolism and typology.

This switchboard was characterized by seven illuminated switches, believed to maintain connectivity with six additional bases and an interplanetary vessel in orbit. This interpretation proposes that the Menorah's seven branches metaphorically signify the seven Elohimite bases established on Earth during that era.","content":"The Menorah has long been a central symbol in Jewish tradition, representing enlightenment, wisdom, and divine inspiration. Its seven branches are often interpreted symbolically, with various interpretations existing within different Jewish traditions.\nEtymology # The word Menorah is of Hebrew origin, deriving from the word מְנוֹרָה (m\u0026rsquo;norá), pronounced \u0026lsquo;men·ō·rä\u0026rsquo;. The term literally translates to lampstand in English. It is a compound of two root words: me\u0026rsquo;ir, meaning shining or giving light, and nor, meaning lamp or light. Hence, the Menorah symbolically represents a source of light. This is fitting given its historical use as a seven-branched lampstand, designed to hold seven lamps, in the temple of Jerusalem.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In the first book of the Raëlian canon, \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh elaborates on the symbolism of the Israelite seven-branched candlestick:\nThe traces of the creators’ bases on high mountains is mentioned in the Book of Amos:\nHe that\u0026hellip; treadeth upon the high places of the earth. Amos 4: 13.\nThe creators had seven bases in all: Those seven;\nthey are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth. Zechariah 4: 10.\nThis is the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, the meaning of which has been lost. In the beginning at the creators’ headquarters, there was a switchboard with seven lighted switches enabling them to stay in contact with the other bases and with the interplanetary vessel orbiting the Earth.\nThe Elohim established bases on Earth, particularly in elevated areas. It cites the Book of Amos from the Bible to substantiate this assertion, specifically Amos 4:13, which refers to a being treading \u0026ldquo;upon the high places of the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to this narrative, the Elohim maintained seven such bases around the planet. This is referenced through an interpretation of Zechariah 4:10, where \u0026ldquo;those seven; they are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth\u0026rdquo; is interpreted to represent the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s bases. These seven sites provided the Elohim with a global overview, thereby acting as the metaphorical \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo; through which they could monitor and manage their creation.\nThe text further proposes that these seven bases are the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, a symbol prominent in Jewish tradition, also known as the Menorah. The original significance of the symbol may have been forgotten over time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s postulated that at the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s central base, a switchboard featuring seven lighted switches existed. These switches were alleged to maintain communication links with the other six bases and an orbiting interplanetary vessel, creating a network of strategic locations from which the Elohim could supervise their creation and conduct their operations on Earth.\nSee also # Wiki › Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki › Star of David Wiki › Swastika Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aries External links # Temple menorah | Wikipedia Candlestick | Jewish Encyclopedia Menorah | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"118","href":"/wiki/military-cover-up-of-exobiology/","title":"Military cover-up of exobiology","description":"Military cover-up of exobiology refers to the idea that military organizations or governments are concealing information about the study of extraterrestrial life or alien encounters.

Proponents of this theory argue that the military is involved in capturing or investigating UFO sightings, conducting secret research on extraterrestrial life forms, or even hiding evidence of direct contact with aliens. The notion of a military cover-up of exobiology implies a deliberate effort to withhold or manipulate information about potential extraterrestrial phenomena for various reasons, such as national security or societal stability.","content":"There are several common cover-up theories associated with military or intelligence agencies, suggesting that they are hiding crucial information about extraterrestrial life from the public. Some of these theories include:\nSuppression of UFO sightings: It is believed that governments and military organizations actively suppress or discredit reports of UFO sightings and encounters. The theory suggests that such actions are taken to maintain public skepticism and prevent widespread acceptance of the existence of extraterrestrial beings or their visitations.\nSecrecy surrounding crash retrievals: This theory proposes that military or intelligence agencies have recovered crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft, but they keep these events hidden from the public. It is believed that the government conducts covert operations to retrieve the wreckage and cover up any evidence, thereby suppressing knowledge of actual contact with alien technology or life forms.\nReverse-engineering alien technology: Proponents of this theory claim that military or intelligence agencies have obtained advanced extraterrestrial technology, either through crashed UFOs or other means. It is believed that these agencies conduct secret programs aimed at reverse-engineering and understanding the alien technology, potentially for military applications, while keeping these efforts concealed from the public.\nConcealment of contact with extraterrestrial beings: Some theories suggest that government agencies have made direct contact or communication with extraterrestrial beings. It is believed that these interactions are purposefully hidden to avoid societal upheaval or panic that may result from the disclosure of such profound and paradigm-shifting information.\nThese cover-up theories propose that military or intelligence agencies engage in deliberate efforts to hide evidence, manipulate information, or maintain strict secrecy surrounding extraterrestrial life. The reasons often speculated include concerns about national security, technological advantage, societal stability, and potential implications on established belief systems.\nBob Lazar and S4 # Bob Lazar is a controversial figure who claims to have worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology at a secretive facility called S-4 near Area 51 in Nevada, United States. His story, which emerged in the late 1980s, made him one of the most famous UFO whistleblowers.\nAccording to Lazar, he was hired by the U.S. government to work on advanced propulsion systems of recovered alien spacecraft. He alleged that the government had nine extraterrestrial vehicles in their possession and that his task was to understand and replicate the technology behind them. Lazar stated that the propulsion system operated based on an element called Element 115, which allegedly enabled anti-gravity propulsion.\nBob Lazar claimed that the technology he encountered while working at the S-4 facility near Area 51 was highly advanced and of extraterrestrial origin. According to Lazar, the propulsion systems used by the alien spacecraft were based on an element called Element 115. He explained that when bombarded with protons, Element 115 generated a gravitational field capable of bending and manipulating space-time, allowing for anti-gravity propulsion. This technology enabled the vehicles to achieve extraordinary speeds and maneuverability beyond the capabilities of human aircraft.\nLazar also mentioned that the energy source for the alien craft was the controlled release of energy from the nuclear decay of Element 115. This process produced a significant amount of power, which fueled the vehicles and sustained their advanced propulsion systems. Additionally, Lazar discussed the presence of gravity amplifiers within the extraterrestrial technology. These amplifiers created intense gravitational fields that could be manipulated to generate anti-gravity effects and control the movement of the spacecraft.\nLazar claimed that the alien craft had advanced navigation and guidance systems, which incorporated artificial intelligence capabilities. These systems allowed the vehicles to autonomously navigate and adapt to their surroundings. Furthermore, Lazar noted that the construction materials of the extraterrestrial spacecraft possessed unique properties that surpassed human technological capabilities. These materials could manipulate gravity, withstand extreme temperatures, and resist high forces.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that while Lazar provided detailed descriptions of this technology, his claims have been met with skepticism and criticism from the scientific community. The lack of verifiable evidence and reproducible experiments has contributed to ongoing debates and controversies surrounding Lazar\u0026rsquo;s assertions. Lazar\u0026rsquo;s claims gained attention when he went public in a series of interviews with investigative journalist George Knapp. He shared details about the alleged extraterrestrial technology, described the layout of the S-4 facility, and claimed to have witnessed flying saucer tests. Lazar\u0026rsquo;s story captivated the public, and he became a prominent figure within the UFO community.\nUFO activity around nuclear facilities # Reports of UFO activity around nuclear facilities have garnered significant attention and speculation. Witnesses, including military personnel and civilians, have reported sightings of unidentified objects near these installations. These UFOs often display unconventional flight patterns, high speeds, and maneuvers beyond known human aircraft capabilities. Some witnesses claim encounters where UFOs have approached or hovered over nuclear sites. Additionally, there have been incidents where UFO sightings coincide with temporary malfunctions or disruptions in the operation of nuclear weapons or systems. This has led to speculation about UFOs having the ability to interfere with or deactivate nuclear technology. However, concrete evidence directly linking these incidents to UFOs remains limited.\nThe military and intelligence agencies have shown interest in these incidents, conducting investigations into the matter. Declassified documents indicate that governments, such as the United States, have sought to understand the potential implications of UFOs on national security, particularly in relation to nuclear weapons. Various hypotheses have been put forth to explain the connection between UFOs and nuclear facilities. Some suggest that extraterrestrial beings may be monitoring or influencing human nuclear capabilities due to concerns about the destructive power of nuclear weapons.\nSee also # Wiki › Ancient Astronaut hypothesis Wiki › Astrobiology Wiki › Ufology External links # Roswell incident | Wikipedia "},{"id":"119","href":"/wiki/moses/","title":"Moses","description":"Moses, a Biblical patriarch from the times of Exodus.","content":"Moses was a prophet, lawgiver, and leader in the Abrahamic religion of Judaism. According to the biblical account, Moses was born in Egypt to Jewish parents and was rescued as a baby and raised by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter. As an adult, he received a divine call from God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Ten Commandments and other laws on Mount Sinai. Moses is considered one of the greatest prophets in Judaism, and his story is an important part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the Islamic Qur\u0026rsquo;an.\nAccording to the biblical account, Moses was born in Egypt to Jewish parents during a time of enslavement and oppression. As a young man, he killed an Egyptian taskmaster who was mistreating a Hebrew slave and fled to Midian. There, he married the daughter of a priest and became a shepherd.\nYears later, God appeared to Moses in a burning bush and called him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses was initially hesitant, but with God\u0026rsquo;s help he performed several miracles, including turning his staff into a serpent, to convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites. After a series of plagues and the final plague of the death of the firstborn, Pharaoh agreed to let the Israelites go. Moses then led the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, where they were pursued by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s army. God miraculously split the sea, allowing the Israelites to cross safely and drowning the Egyptians.\nMoses then led the Israelites to Mount Sinai, where he received the Ten Commandments and other laws from God. Moses also played a key role in establishing the tabernacle, a portable temple for the worship of God, and organized the Israelites into a community governed by the laws and practices he received from God.\nAfter 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, Moses died at the age of 120 and was buried by God in an unknown location. Despite his death, Moses remains a revered figure in the history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and is considered one of the greatest leaders and prophets in the Abrahamic tradition.\nMoshe # The origin of the name Moses is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, his name is given as \u0026ldquo;Moshe\u0026rdquo; (מֹשֶׁה) and is derived from the Egyptian word \u0026ldquo;mose\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son.\u0026rdquo; Some scholars believe that the name may have been given to him by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter, who rescued him as a baby, while others believe that it may have been a name commonly given to boys in ancient Egypt.\nIn the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, Moses\u0026rsquo; name is given as \u0026ldquo;Mouses\u0026rdquo; (Μωυσῆς), which is the source of the English name \u0026ldquo;Moses.\u0026rdquo; Other versions of the name in different languages include Moïse in French, Mosè in Italian, and Moisés in Spanish. Regardless of its origin, the name Moses has become synonymous with the prophet, lawgiver, and leader who is revered as one of the greatest figures in the history of Judaism and a central figure in the Abrahamic tradition.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In the third Chapter of The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, Watching Over the Chosen People, Yahweh contextualized the need for a new prophet:\nBecause of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:\nPut away the foreign gods that are among you.\n— Genesis 35: 2.\nIn Exodus, we appeared to Moses.\nAnd the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush.\n— Exodus 3: 2.\nA rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.\nThe people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.\nThe successors of the once advanced civilization had become slaves to neighboring tribes after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and that it was necessary to restore their dignity by returning their land to them. The people there had regressed to a primitive state, worshipping idols instead of acknowledging the true creators, the Elohim. In Exodus, Moses encountered an extraterrestrial being, Yahweh, who appeared to him in a flame of fire. The text suggests that this was a result of a rocket landing in front of him, which he interpreted in a way that corresponds to the experiences of a person from a primitive culture encountering a flying vessel.\nFurther on, Yahweh explains the following:\nThen in Chapter 20 of Exodus a certain number of rules are cited. Because the Israelites were so primitive, they needed laws regarding morals and especially hygiene. These were outlined in the commandments. The creators came to dictate these laws to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they arrived in a flying vessel:\nAnd it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled\u0026hellip; And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. Moses spake, and Elohim answered him by a voice.\n— Exodus 19: 16-19.\nThe creators were afraid of being invaded or maltreated by human beings. It was therefore essential that they be respected, even venerated, so that they would be in no danger:\nThe people cannot come up to mount Sinai\u0026hellip; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Yahweh, lest he break forth upon them.\n— Exodus 19: 23-24.\nIt explains how the Elohim, the creators dictated a set of rules and commandments to Moses in order to guide the primitive Israelites in matters of morals and hygiene. The text also describes how the creators arrived on Mount Sinai in a flying vessel, which caused thunder and lightening and a great commotion among the people. The creators were fearful of being invaded or mistreated by the humans, so it was essential that they be respected and venerated. The people were not allowed to approach Mount Sinai or come up to Yahweh, as this could be dangerous.\nIn summary, Moses was a prophet who received guidance and assistance from extraterrestrial beings, referred to as the creators. The creators helped Moses liberate the people of Israel from slavery, guided them through the desert, and provided them with food and water. They also provided the Israelites with laws and regulations, including the Ten Commandments, which were intended to guide their morality and hygiene. Additionally, the creators requested offerings and a residence built for them according to their own plans. Finally, the creators assisted the Israelites in conquering the Promised Land and provided them with medical knowledge, including how to treat snakebites.\nSee also # Wiki › Prophet Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aries External links # Moses | Wikipedia Moses | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"120","href":"/wiki/mytheme/","title":"Mytheme","description":"Mytheme, a fundamental unit of mythological narrative structure.","content":"A mytheme is a basic unit or component of a myth, folklore, or religious tradition. It refers to a recurring motif, symbol, story, or character that appears in multiple myths and legends across cultures and time periods. Mythemes often serve as building blocks for larger myths and stories and can convey important cultural values, beliefs, or moral lessons. In comparative mythology, the study of mythemes helps scholars identify common themes, symbols, and motifs across cultures and understand how they are transformed and evolve over time. The concept of mytheme was first introduced by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and has since become an important tool in the study of comparative mythology and folklore.\nWhile there are hundreds of catalogized mythemes, here are a few examples of famous mythemes:\nThe Flood Myth: A story of a great flood that destroys the world and is often seen as a symbol of rebirth and renewal. This myth is found in many cultures, including the ancient Babylonian myth of the epic of Gilgamesh, the biblical story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, and the Hindu myth of Manu.\nThe Hero\u0026rsquo;s Journey: A narrative pattern in which a hero embarks on a quest, faces challenges, and ultimately returns home transformed. This mytheme is found in the mythologies of many cultures, including the Greek myth of Odysseus and the Hindu myth of Rama.\nThe Trickster: A figure, often represented by a god, animal, or other supernatural being, who is known for playing tricks, breaking rules, and testing the limits of society. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the African American folktales of Br\u0026rsquo;er Rabbit, the Norse myth of Loki, and the Native American myth of Coyote.\nThe Divine Twins: A pair of gods or demigods who are often depicted as inseparable and are associated with complementary aspects of life, such as light and darkness, good and evil, or birth and death. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus, the Greek myth of Castor and Pollux, and the Hindu myth of Ashvins.\nThe Creation Myth: A story that explains the origins of the world and its inhabitants. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the biblical story of Genesis, the ancient Egyptian myth of Atum, and the Hindu myth of Brahma.\nThe Apocalypse Myth: A story of the end of the world and the events leading up to it. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the biblical book of Revelation, the Norse myth of Ragnarok, and the Hindu myth of Kali Yuga.\nThe Quest for Immortality: A story in which a hero embarks on a journey to find a way to achieve immortality or escape death. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Greek myth of the Golden Fleece, the Chinese myth of Xian, and the African myth of Anansi.\nThe Abandoned Child: A story in which a child is abandoned by its parents and must overcome obstacles to find its place in the world. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus, the biblical story of Moses, and the Native American myth of the Orphan Boy.\nThe Underworld Journey: A story in which a hero travels to the underworld to rescue a loved one, retrieve a lost object, or gain knowledge.

Neo-Euhemerism can be understood as the philosophical paradigm to equate ancient Gods with a spacefaring civilization, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. Hence the hypothesis put forward here on Wheel of Heaven is indeed sharing a similar DNA with neo-euhemeristic premises.","content":"Euhemerism # Euhemerism is a philosophical and literary approach to myths and legends that views them as exaggerated accounts of historical events. The approach is named after Euhemerus, a 4th-century BCE Greek philosopher, who argued that the gods of mythology were originally historical figures who were later deified and worshipped as gods.\nAccording to Euhemeristic theory, myths and legends were created by early societies as a way of explaining natural phenomena and cultural traditions. Over time, these accounts were embellished and transformed into grand tales of gods and heroes, but they retained some connection to the original historical events that inspired them.\nEuhemerism has been influential in the study of religion, mythology, and the history of culture, and has been used as a tool for interpreting the beliefs and practices of ancient societies. Some modern scholars have criticized Euhemerism for oversimplifying the complex interplay between history, culture, and religion, but it remains an important perspective in the study of mythology and ancient beliefs.\nNeo-euhemerism # Neo-Euhemerism is a modern take that builds on the concept of Euhemerism, which suggests that gods and other mythical beings were originally historical figures whose legends and stories became distorted over time. Neo-Euhemerism goes a step further by proposing that ancient gods were actually humanoid aliens. While the original Euhemeristic approach emphasized the historical basis of myth and saw the gods of mythology as originally historical figures who were later deified, neo-Euhemerism expands on this approach and views the deified people as extraterrestrial in origin and were deified because of their scientific and technological leap which looked magical and supernatural in the eyes of earlier human civilizations. It is an idea that suggests that myths and legends may have originated from encounters with extraterrestrial beings.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino writes in his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Idea About The Bible this:\nWe have addressed the issue of the origin of religion as the possible result of historical events, real experiences, and concrete and tangible relationships with some “gods”.\nHe begins the book with the following premise:\nOld Testament writings are generally derived from stories written by other people, such as the ancient Sumerians. These stories have given rise to certain theories, which are summarized here in this first chapter. These theories, – we can call them truths - that once confirmed will cause the end of a great illusion: Our current religious thought system based on concepts developed by men. This religious thought system which includes Christianity, is being operated by those who have exploited pretentiously-named “sacred texts” in order to build a structure a power structure of control and manipulation. It is time for that all to end; and it is time for the truth. For instance, we are interested in knowing how, where and when the Bible speaks of Anaqìm: Concrete beings that have come to Earth from other worlds. Though the Roman Catholic Church now acknowledges this information, they continue to misleadingly represent the Anaqim as “spiritual entities.” As we analyze the Old Testament, we will identify these concrete beings using their correct Hebrew names (for instance “Those who from heaven to Earth came” in Hebrew are “Anaqiti” instead of the more well-known published Sumerian name, “Anunnaki”).\nThis is a story that can be disconcerting for some, but certainly full of fascination, and one that also brings an overwhelming liberating potential for those who walk a free thinking path. It is a story far removed from dogmas, illusions and forced interpretations of modern Christianity. Modern religions tend to be adapted to a preconceived vision of divinity, that one which immediately identifies the presence of the word “God” with transcendence. They create an “alternative” world, a divinity far from man in substance and form: undefined, vague and not able to be represented. You will soon find out that the Bible talks of many other “gods”; precisely, the most ancient texts tell the story of these gods in connection with the origin of men and the Jewish people. These texts tell about times when men still walked with gods (namely the Anaqìms/Elohìms). We find that men used to talk and eat with them, make arrangements with them, and serve them; but also use them and betray them, follow and abandon them, all according to the interests of the moment and the contingent circumstances. This was an historical era when men could choose their “gods” from among the many possibilities, never asking the question of just one god. The divine was perceived in a totally different way from that which was to be eventually built, once men lost this direct contact.\nBiglino argues that the Old Testament writings are largely based on stories from ancient Sumerians and that these stories reveal concrete beings called Anaqìm who came to Earth from other worlds. He suggests that modern Christianity and other religions have distorted the true nature of divinity, which is far removed from dogmas and forced interpretations. The Bible talks about many other \u0026ldquo;gods,\u0026rdquo; and in the past, men used to walk and talk with them, make arrangements, serve them, and betray them. The divine was perceived differently in the past than it is today, and this understanding could bring an overwhelming liberating potential for those who walk a free-thinking path. The core tenet of this free-thinking path is neo-euhemeristic in essence as it postualtes as re-interpretation of the divine beings of Biblical scriptures to be actual beings of flesh and blood and the meaning of the writings got distorted over time.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # The concept of Neo-Euhemerism can be seen as a core tenet of the philosophical implications of Raëlism, which posits that the Elohim mentioned in various religious texts, including the Bible, were actually extraterrestrial beings who visited Earth in the distant past and were mistaken for gods. Raëlism suggests that the true accounts of these extraterrestrial visitors were distorted over time, leading to the creation of various myths and religious stories that continue to be believed by many people today. In this way, Raëlism can be seen as a form of Neo-Euhemerism that uses modern scientific knowledge and advancements to reinterpret ancient religious stories and reveal what it believes to be the true origins of humanity and our relationship to the universe.\nSee also # Wiki › Ancient Astronaut hypothesis Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Sendy\u0026#39;s conditions of coherence Wiki › Plurality of Gods External links # Euhemerism | Wikipedia néo-évhémérisme | Wiktionary [FR] "},{"id":"122","href":"/wiki/new-commandments/","title":"New Commandments","description":"The New Commandments, a series of doctrines put forward by Yahweh that elaborate what humanity could take into account in order to progress and usher into the Golden Age, now at the beginning of the Age of Aquarius.","content":"In Raëlism 🔯 # The New Commandments are constituted of the following aspects:\nGeniocracy Humanitarnism World Government The mission of the propagation of the Truth See also # Wiki › Geniocracy Wiki › Humanitarianism Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius Read more # Resources › The Book Which Tells The Truth "},{"id":"123","href":"/wiki/new-jerusalem/","title":"New Jerusalem","description":"Third Temple, a residence for the Elohim that should be rebuilt during the times of the Apocalypse.","content":"New Jerusalem is a concept in the Christian tradition that refers to a heavenly city or a renewed, perfected earthly city.

According to the story, God saw that the world had become corrupt and wicked, and decided to cleanse it with a great flood.

This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nWhen the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth.

And as I gave you the greenplants, I give you everything. 4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # The passage which precedes the Biblical formalization of the Noahic covenant is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with Raël. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, showcases the mentioning of how the Elohim promised to never destroy life on Earth again:\nThe creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n\u0026hellip;for the imagination of man’s heart is evil. Genesis 8: 21.\nThe creators were pleased to see that the humans had expressed gratitude for their preservation and promised not to try to destroy their creation again. They realized that it was natural for humans to desire scientific progress. Despite this, they acknowledged that the human heart can be prone to evil, as stated in Genesis 8:21. The preservation of life was seen as a positive outcome. Having safeguarded life was good in the eyes of the banished creators.\nSee also # Wiki › Great Flood Wiki › Noah\u0026#39;s Ark Wiki › Tower of Babel Intro › Timeline › Age of Gemini # Noahic covenant Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Gemini External links # Covenant (biblical) # Noahic covenant | Wikipedia Seven Laws of Noah | Wikipedia "},{"id":"127","href":"/wiki/number-of-man/","title":"Number of Man","description":"Number of Man, also known as the Number of the Beast or simply by the value it represents, 666 (χξϛ), is the number of human generations that will have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men during Genesis. If a generation is defined to last 20 years, the product of the Number of Man amounts to 13'320 years. If we have just entered the Age of Aquarius and we assume this coincides with the Number of Man, the first human being must have been created half a precessional cycle ago, which would be at the beginning of the Age of Leo..","content":"The Number of the Beast is mentioned in the New Testament Book of Revelation, specifically in Chapter 13, Verses 16-18. According to these verses, the number of the beast is written as 666.\n18 Ὧδε ἡ σοφία ἐστίν· ὁ ἔχων τὸν νοῦν ψηφισάτω τὸν ἀριθμὸν τοῦ θηρίου· ἀριθμὸς γὰρ ἀνθρώπου ἐστί· καὶ ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτοῦ χξϛʹ\n18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.\nTriangular number # From a mathematical point of view, the number 666 is a triangular number. A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The $nth$ triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with $n$ dots on each side, and is equal to the sum of the $n$ natural numbers from $1$ to $n$. The sequence of triangular numbers, starting with the $0th$ triangular number, contains the following numbers, where $666$ is the $36th$ entry in that sequence:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, \u0026hellip;, 595, 630, 666 \\end{equation*} $$\nThe mathematical way to express the sequence is contained in the following formula:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} T_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \u0026hellip; + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\end{equation*} $$\nIf the formula is solved against $n = 36$, the triangular number formula will result in being equal to $666$:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} T_{36} = \\sum_{k=0}^{36} k = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \u0026hellip; + 36 = \\frac{36(36+1)}{2} = 666 \\end{equation*} $$\nThis is mathematically interesting as triangular numbers are a subtype of figurative numbers.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Let\u0026rsquo;s Welcome the Extraterrestrials, The Apocalypse of the Final Nuclear Cataclysm, Yahweh explains what has been described in the Book of the Apocalypse which was revealed to John:\nThis final test of Humanity, that is, the choice between self-destruction or the passage into the Golden Age, is the last opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad.\nIf Humanity brilliantly overcomes this last ordeal and succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then men will have proven themselves worthy of receiving our inheritance, since they will have shown they are truly non-violent.\nThe “beast”, as described further on in the text, is simply the use of nuclear energy for murderous means:\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. Revelation 13: 18.\nIn fact, 666 is the number of human generations which will have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories. The very first humans were created some 13,000 years ago, and a human generation is estimated at an average of 20 years, so if one multiplies 666 by 20, it equals 13,320 years.\nThe generation born at the beginning of the Age of Apocalypse in 1945 of the Christian era, was in fact the 666th since the creation of the first man in a laboratory by the Elohim. This generation coincides precisely with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes at Hiroshima, on August 6th, 1945.\nOnce again, interpretation was not required in order to understand. One had only to read what had been written. 666 was effectively the “number of Man”, the number of men who descended from the creation, that is to say, the number of generations.\nIn this passage, it is suggested that the final test of humanity is the choice between self-destruction and the passage into a Golden Age, which is the last opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad. If humanity succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then it will have proven itself worthy of receiving the inheritance. The \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; mentioned in the book of Revelation is interpreted as the use of nuclear energy for murderous purposes. The number 666 is interpreted as the number of human generations that have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories. This generation coincides with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes in Hiroshima in 1945.\nOur take # Considering that the Number of Man may represents a given number of human generations would make it be a duration of time. Depending on what number of years a human generation amounts to, we would get different time durations. A generation is often defined as the average length of time between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring. Therefore, a generation can vary in length depending on factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and cultural norms. 20 years can be considered a sound amount of years it takes for a generation to take place.\nIf we use 20 years for a generation, and the Number of Man being the total amount of human generations, we can determine arithmetically the duration of time the Number of Man ultimately represents with the following amount of years:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 20y \\times 666 = 13'320y \\end{equation*} $$\nGiven that at Wheel of Heaven, we think in terms of precessional cycles, we would like to determine how many Great Months or World Ages that amount of years represents. A Great Month is defined as the $12th$ of the precessional Great Year which is nominally defined as 25'920 years, rendering a Great Month to be nominally a duration of 2'160 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{13'320y}{2'160y} = 6.166\u0026hellip; \\end{equation*} $$\nWith these assumptions, we can say the Number of Man amounts to 6 Great Months or in other words half a full precessional cycle. If we now consider Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s statement that the 666th generation has been born around 1945 which coincided with the first man-made explosion of a nuclear weapon, we can determine when the first generation of human beings created during the later stages of Genesis: Exactly 13'320 years before 1945 of the Common Era which would date back to the year 11'375 BCE.\nIt is worth noting that the date of 11'375 BCE holds particular significance as it falls precisely at the point where the Age of Virgo (13'170-11'010 BCE) transitions into the Age of Leo (11'010-8'850 BCE). According to our interpretation of Genesis, this would place the creation of the human species at the very start of the sixth day of creation, immediately following the Age of Virgo and on the cusp of the Age of Leo.\nSee also # Wiki › Apocalypse Wiki › Genesis Read more # Intro › Timeline › Age of Aquarius External links # Number of the beast | Wikipedia 666 (New Testament) | Britannica "},{"id":"128","href":"/wiki/pangaea/","title":"Pangaea","description":"Pangaea, an antediluvian supercontinent that got terraformed out of a Earth-wide shallow sea bed by the Elohim soon after they arrived to planet Earth and started to investiagte its constitution.","content":"Pangea is a scientific theory that suggests that all of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents were once joined together into a single supercontinent. This supercontinent is believed to have existed between about 300 million and 200 million years ago, before breaking apart and eventually forming the continents as they are known today.\nAccording to the theory of plate tectonics, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents are moving and shifting over time, driven by the movement of large plates that make up the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust. The idea of Pangea suggests that at one point in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s history, these plates collided and merged to form a single, massive landmass.\nThe exact shape and configuration of Pangea is not well understood, but it is believed to have been a unique and sprawling landmass that covered much of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. The exact location of the continents within Pangea is also a matter of scientific speculation, but it is believed that the continents were situated differently from how they are today.\nIn terms of its appearance, Pangea would have been a vastly different landscape from what is seen today, with unique flora and fauna, and a different geography and climate. It is also believed that the arrangement of landmasses within Pangea would have had a major impact on the evolution of life on Earth, leading to the development of many of the species that exist today.\nOverall, Pangea is a fascinating scientific theory that offers a glimpse into the Earth\u0026rsquo;s geological history and provides a unique perspective on the formation and movement of the planet\u0026rsquo;s continents.\nEtymology # The name pangaea is neologism of modern times and does not come from a line of the Tradition.

This may include ideas like the abolition of private property, the absence of a state, and the establishment of a cooperative and self-sustaining economy.\nOther interpretations of paradism emphasize spiritual aspects, envisioning a society where individuals have achieved a deep sense of inner peace and contentment, and are able to live in connection with the divine.\nTechno-utopia # Paradism can be contextualized in the contemporary dialogue with consideration to following aspects:\nPost-scarcity economy Technological determinism Transhumanism A techno-utopia is a hypothetical society in which technology has been used to create a perfect world, free from scarcity, inequality, and suffering. In a techno-utopia, technology is seen as the solution to all social and environmental problems, and is used to create a society that is sustainable, efficient, and maximally productive. The concept of techno-utopia has been a recurring theme in science fiction and is often associated with ideas of transhumanism and post-scarcity economics.

In the future, even that one person will be unnecessary. Workers\u0026rsquo; unions are not happy about this because factories are in less and less need of personnel and are letting more and more workers go. This is not normal — these fantastic machines which do the work of 500 people should enable those 500 to really live, rather than enrich only one person, their boss.\nNo individual should be in the service of another, nor work for anyone for a salary. Machines can easily do all the chores and take care of all the work, enabling people to dedicate themselves to the one thing for which they were created — to think, create and blossom.\nThe advancement of science and technology can liberate humanity from hunger and the obligation to work for a living by automating daily chores, but instead of benefiting only a few, these fantastic machines should enable people to live and dedicate themselves to creativity and personal growth.\nThe passage suggests that automation and technology have the potential to liberate humanity by freeing individuals from the obligation to work to live and by allowing them to dedicate themselves to more creative pursuits. The author argues that science and technology should serve human well-being, rather than violence or personal profit, and that machines can do much of the work that people currently do. The passage suggests that automation could lead to a more equitable and fulfilling.\nThe idea that science and technology can liberate humanity from work and solve many social problems, as well as the belief that automation can replace human labor, are both common themes in techno-utopianism. The concept of a \u0026ldquo;terrestrial paradise\u0026rdquo; achieved through technology and the vision of a future where machines take care of daily chores and enable people to focus on creative pursuits are also common elements in techno-utopian thinking.\nSee also # Wiki › Cyberparadism Wiki › Elohimian home planet Wiki › Humanitarianism Wiki › New Commandments External links # Paradism | Spin-off organization of Raëlism Post-scarcity economy | Wikipedia Fully Automated Luxury Individualist Anarchism | Edmund Berger article Fully Automated Luxury Communism | Wikipedia "},{"id":"131","href":"/resources/parzival/","title":"Parzival","description":"Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\" is a seminal work of high medieval literature, written in the early 13th century.

This epic poem is one of the most important narratives of the Arthurian legend, particularly notable for its detailed portrayal of the quest for the Holy Grail. The story revolves around Parzival (Percival in English), a knight from the court of King Arthur, and chronicles his journey from naive and impetuous youth to the wise and compassionate keeper of the Holy Grail.\nParzival\u0026rsquo;s journey is one of both physical and spiritual growth. He starts as a sheltered young man, raised in isolation from society by his mother, who wishes to protect him from the dangers of knighthood. Despite her efforts, Parzival is drawn to the world of knights and quests, eventually leaving home to pursue a life of chivalry. His early adventures are marked by both success and moral failure, most notably his encounter with the Fisher King, where his failure to ask a crucial question results in prolonged suffering and the wasteland of the Fisher King\u0026rsquo;s lands.\nThroughout the narrative, Parzival encounters a series of challenges and trials that test his character and understanding of knightly virtues. The poem intricately weaves themes of chivalry, love, sin, and redemption, as Parzival gradually learns the importance of compassion, humility, and the need to ask the right questions.\nEschenbach\u0026rsquo;s work is distinguished by its complex narrative structure, rich character development, and deep exploration of the spiritual and ethical dimensions of the Grail quest. \u0026ldquo;Parzival\u0026rdquo; is not only a tale of adventure but also a profound moral and religious allegory, reflecting the philosophical and theological concerns of its time. The poem\u0026rsquo;s influence extends beyond its era, continuing to resonate in modern interpretations of the Arthurian legend and the quest for spiritual fulfillment.\nAbout Wolfram von Eschenbach # Wolfram von Eschenbach, a prominent figure in medieval German literature, lived during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. His exact dates of birth and death are unknown, but his works and mentions by contemporaries place him in the High Middle Ages, a period marked by a flourishing of chivalry and courtly culture. A knight by profession, Wolfram distinguished himself not only in the feudal duties of his class but also as a masterful poet and storyteller. He is best known for \u0026ldquo;Parzival,\u0026rdquo; a rich and complex retelling of the Percival legend and the quest for the Holy Grail, which stands as one of the greatest epics of the medieval period.\nApart from \u0026ldquo;Parzival,\u0026rdquo; Wolfram\u0026rsquo;s other notable works include \u0026ldquo;Willehalm,\u0026rdquo; a heroic epic based on the life of William of Orange, and \u0026ldquo;Titurel,\u0026rdquo; a fragmentary narrative focusing on the Grail guardians. His writing is characterized by a unique blend of chivalric tradition and deep philosophical insight, combined with an idiosyncratic and sometimes enigmatic style. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Wolfram often eschewed the typical Latin learning of the medieval scholarly elite, instead boasting of his reliance on vernacular sources and his own innate wisdom. This self-proclaimed lack of formal education did not diminish the complexity and depth of his narratives, which exhibit a profound understanding of human nature and the moral quandaries of his time. Despite the scarcity of biographical details, Wolfram von Eschenbach\u0026rsquo;s legacy endures through his contributions to the Arthurian legend and the broader tapestry of medieval literature.\nExternal links # Electronic version of a Parzival-manuscript from the Bibliotheca Palatina (Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg) Literary Encyclopedia entry on Parzival "},{"id":"132","href":"/wiki/plurality-of-gods/","title":"Plurality of Gods","description":"The Plurality of Gods represents the distinctive interpretation that the Biblical tradition testifies to the existence of multiple divine beings. This concept also encompasses the belief that these divine beings were once akin to humans, and correspondingly, that humans possess the potential to evolve into god-like entities in the future.","content":"In common terms, the Plurality of Gods refers to a belief system or theological concept that upholds the existence of more than one god or deity. This stands in contrast to monotheism, which asserts the existence of a single supreme deity.\nOne of the primary examples of belief systems involving a plurality of gods is polytheism. Polytheism is a belief in many gods who are often organized in a complex social order. These gods may form something akin to a divine family, and each one has specific functions, attributes, or domains over which they hold control. Ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Norse religions are prime examples of polytheistic belief systems.\nAnother form is henotheism, where there is the belief in and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities. Hinduism has elements of this belief system, where devotees may focus their worship on a specific deity like Shiva or Vishnu, while acknowledging the existence of other gods and goddesses.\nIn Mormonism # The notion of Plurality of Gods is very specifc in Mormonism. In the context of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often known as the LDS Church or the Mormon Church or simply as Mormonism), the concept of a plurality of gods is distinct from the polytheistic and henotheistic traditions in other religions. Mormon theology teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, which make up the Godhead.\nThe Mormon Church also holds a belief in the potential for human beings to achieve a form of divinity, often referred to as \u0026ldquo;exaltation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;eternal progression.\u0026rdquo; This doctrine is based on several biblical and Book of Mormon verses that talk about humans becoming joint-heirs with Christ, as well as later teachings by church leaders, most notably Lorenzo Snow\u0026rsquo;s couplet: \u0026ldquo;As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be.\u0026rdquo;\nSee also # Wiki › Cosmic pluralism Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Neo-euhemerism External links # God in Mormonism # Plurality of Gods | Wikipedia The Plurality of Gods | MormonWiki "},{"id":"133","href":"/wiki/precession/","title":"Precession","description":"Precession, the steady change of orientation of the axis of rotation of Earth. Precession is the third key motion of the Earth next to the rotation around its axis (day cycle) and its revolution around the Sun (year). A full precessional cycle takes 25'920 years to complete.","content":"The natural cause that accounts for the cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is called precession and is defined in regards to its impact on the planet Earth as the steady change of orientation of the axis of rotation of Earth. In other words, besides the two fundamental motions of our planet Earth, the rotation of the planet around its own axis which we call the day/night cycle, and the revolution of the planet in its orbit around the Sun which we call the year cycle, there is a third key motion which accounts for yet another important cycle, but which lasts too long for us to take notice. This third key motion is called the precession of the equinoxes or sometimes just simply precession.\nThe precession of the equinoxes is the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis in space. This movement causes the position of the celestial poles and the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis to change over time, which in turn affects the position of the sun relative to the stars and the equinoxes.\nThe equinoxes are the two points in the year when the sun is directly over the equator, causing equal amounts of daylight and darkness around the world. However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the position of the sun relative to the stars and the equinoxes changes over time, causing the equinoxes to slowly move through the zodiac.\nThe precession of the equinoxes is a slow process, taking approximately 26'000 years to complete one cycle. It is caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge, which causes the rotational axis to slowly change direction.\nIn astrology and some esoteric traditions, the precession of the equinoxes is seen as having spiritual and philosophical significance, with each era of the precession being associated with a different astrological age and a different spiritual paradigm.\nCause # The precession of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon acting upon the equatorial bulge of the Earth. Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial diameter is about 43 km larger than its polar diameter, creating a slight bulge around the equator.\nThe gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on this bulge causes a torque that changes the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. The torque causes the rotational axis to move in a circular path, tracing out a cone over time. This is called precession.\nAdditionally, Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle, but an ellipse. As a result, the Sun\u0026rsquo;s gravitational force on Earth varies over the course of a year. This also contributes to the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis.\nThe combined effect of these gravitational forces causes the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis to change over time, tracing out a complete circle in a period of approximately 26,000 years. The precession of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis has important implications for our understanding of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and seasons.\nAxial tilt # The axial tilt of the Earth, also known as the obliquity of the ecliptic, refers to the angle at which the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt is currently about 23.5 degrees and is responsible for the changing seasons on Earth.\nThe precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis affects the axial tilt in a couple of ways. First, the precession changes the direction of the rotational axis over time, which means that the axial tilt is changing as well. This means that the direction of the axial tilt relative to the stars is constantly shifting.\nSecond, the precession also changes the angle at which the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is tilted relative to the ecliptic plane. Over time, the axial tilt can vary from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees due to the precession. This variation in axial tilt has important implications for the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate, as it can affect the distribution of sunlight on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface and, in turn, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate patterns.\nIn summary, the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is related to the axial tilt in that it affects the direction and angle of the axial tilt over time.\nNorth Pole star # The current North Pole star, also known as the North Star or Polaris, is a star located near the celestial north pole. The celestial north pole is the point in the sky directly above the Earth\u0026rsquo;s North Pole.\nDue to the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis, the position of the celestial north pole changes over time, and as a result, the North Star also changes. This means that over a period of approximately 26,000 years, a different star will be located near the celestial north pole and will serve as the North Star.\nCurrently, Polaris is located very close to the celestial north pole and is therefore used as a reference point for navigation and astronomical observations. However, as the precession continues, the position of the celestial north pole will gradually move away from Polaris, and a different star will eventually become the North Star.\nIn about the year 14,000 AD, the North Star is expected to be the bright star Vega. So, as the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis continues, the North Star will gradually shift from Polaris to Vega and then to other stars over time.\nZodiac # The precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis also affects the position of the stars in the sky and, as a result, the apparent position of the constellations. This has important implications for the zodiac, which is a band of the sky divided into twelve equal parts, each named for the constellation that appears in that part of the sky.\nDue to precession, the position of the celestial equator and the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, changes over time. This means that the position of the constellations relative to the Sun also changes over time. As a result, the apparent position of the constellations along the ecliptic and the zodiac changes over time.\nIn ancient times, the zodiac was based on the positions of the constellations along the ecliptic at that time. However, due to the precession, the position of the constellations has shifted over time, so that the zodiac signs as they were defined thousands of years ago no longer align with the position of the constellations in the sky today.\nThe twelve constellations of the zodiac were defined by the ancient Babylonians over 2,000 years ago. They named each of the twelve equal parts of the ecliptic, or the band of the sky along which the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to move, after a different constellation.\nThese constellations were chosen because they were easily recognizable and distinct from one another. They included Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces.\nThe Babylonians believed that the positions of these constellations along the ecliptic were significant and that they had astrological implications for the future. This idea was later adopted by the ancient Greeks and became an integral part of astrology and astronomical observations.\nOver time, the twelve constellations of the zodiac have become widely recognized and are still used in astrology today, although the positions of the constellations relative to the zodiac have changed due to precession. Despite this, the names and symbolic associations of the twelve constellations of the zodiac have remained largely unchanged for thousands of years and continue to be used in astrology and astronomical observations.\nThe 4 Cardinal days # An equinox is the time when the Sun is directly overhead the equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal all over the world. There are two equinoxes in a year: the Vernal Equinox (around March 20th or 21st) and the Autumnal Equinox (around September 22nd or 23rd).\nA solstice is the time when the Sun is at its farthest point from the equator, resulting in the longest or shortest day of the year, depending on the hemisphere. There are two solstices in a year: the Summer Solstice (around June 20th or 21st) and the Winter Solstice (around December 21st or 22nd).\nThe four cardinal days - the two equinoxes and two solstices - mark the changing of the seasons and have been significant to many cultures throughout history for various astronomical, agricultural, and cultural reasons.\nDue to precession, the position of the celestial equator and the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, changes over time. As a result, the position of the equinoxes, which are the two points in the sky where the Sun appears to cross the celestial equator and mark the start of spring and autumn, also changes over time.\nThe equinoxes were used by ancient astronomers and astrologers to determine the position of the zodiac and the constellations along the ecliptic. The equinoxes were considered important because they represented the start of spring and autumn and marked the beginning of new seasons.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino writes in his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Idea About The Bible the following about the precession:\nThis expression indicates the celestial phenomenon caused by the oscillation or wobble of the Earth axis making a circular motion similar to that of a slowly-spinning top. This oscillation results in an apparent demotion of the constellations in the celestial sphere. It happens because the imaginary line joining the ecliptic of spring and autumn equinoxes moves one degree approximately every 71 years. Each of the twelve signs of the zodiac that form the entire 360° sky arc, covered a period of 2,160 years, corresponding to what astrology labeled as “Ages”: Age of Aries, Age of Taurus, and so on. The complete cycle of 360° thus requires a little less than 26,000 years (2160 x 12). Hence, it would have been impossible to observe and calculate. Regardless, this long period, called the “Great Year”, was known by many civilizations in various parts of the world such as the Indus Valley, Egypt, Central America; and still today scholars wonder how a nomadic people of herders and farmers were able to calculate its duration! Might it have been of any use to ANUNNAKI “gods” to calculate the orbital timing of their home planet, and to plan their space travels that were inevitably very long? Perhaps, the answer to many mysteries resides in accepting this possibility\u0026hellip;\nSee also # Wiki › Great Year External links # Axial precession Precession of the equinoxes | Britannica "},{"id":"134","href":"/wiki/prophet/","title":"Prophet","description":"Prophet, a human ambassador that serves as the messenger and representative on behalf of the Elohim, the creator civilization that genetically engineered life on Earth.

He gradually adopted the name Raël and wrote down the dialogues that happened during all the encounters in a number of books that anyone can read today. The premise of the Raëlian faith is that most religions are witnessing the doings of a god-like advanced extraterrestrial civilization that terraformed Earth some 25'000 years ago and subsequently synthetically created life on Earth as described in the Biblical Genesis and other creation myths.","content":"Raëlism is a religious and philosophical movement that originated in France in the 1970s. It is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim created life on Earth and continue to interact with humanity. The founder of Raëlism, Claude Vorilhon, also known as Raël, claims that he had a series of encounters with a being from another planet who gave him messages to share with the world.\nAccording to Raëlian beliefs, the Elohim are highly advanced beings who used their genetic engineering skills to create humans and other species. Raelians believe that all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, have their origins in ancient extraterrestrial visitations, and that the Elohim are the gods described in various mythologies.\nThe Raëlian movement emphasizes individual freedom and tolerance, and seeks to promote peace and understanding among people of all cultures and religions. They also advocate for scientific and technological advancements, such as cloning, as a means of improving human life and creating a better future for all.\nWhile Raëlism has gained a significant following in some countries, it is considered a controversial and non-mainstream movement by many. Critics argue that the beliefs and claims of Raëlism are unsupported by scientific evidence, and that it represents a form of new age spirituality or pseudoscience.\nEtymology # As stated in his book The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, Claude Vorhilon is making converstation with Yahweh and Yahweh says the following about what Raël means:\nYou, Claude Vorilhon, you will spread the truth under your present name, which you will replace progressively with RAEL, which means literally “light of God” and if we translate it more accurately, “light of the Elohim” or “Ambassador of the Elohim”, because you will be our ambassador on Earth, and we will come only officially to your Embassy. RAEL can be simply translated as “messenger”.\nIn this passage, Yahweh, as the representative of the Elohimian civilization, asks Claude Vorhilon to be their messenger. RAEL, capitalized in the writings, is a denomination composed of two separate words: Ra and El. Ra as the first compound is explained to mean \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo;. This meaning can be derived from the Afro-Asiatic Egyptian rꜥ, Sun.1 El as the second compound is explained to stand for the Elohim, where Elohim designate the beings that come from the Sky, the ones from Above, the Heavens.2 Combining these two compounds, as suggested by Yahweh himself, would lead to the meaning of \u0026ldquo;the light of those who come from the sky\u0026rdquo;, the ambassador or messenger of the parent civilization that created life on Earth and are still in touch with the developments on planet Earth.\nThe Canon # There are three works that are considered canonical in the Raelian movement:\nThe Book Which Tells the Truth (1973) The Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet (1976) Let\u0026rsquo;s Welcome The Extraterrestrials (1979) In the first two of these books, it is revealed that life on Earth is not a product of random evolution, but rather the result of a deliberate creation. This creation, however, is not divine but was carried out in a laboratory by beings with a deep understanding of genetics and cellular biology, similar to our most advanced scientists today. This is the core message of these works, which were dictated to Rael by the Elohim, extraterrestrial beings far more advanced than our civilization, in the crater of a volcano in Auvergne, France, where they telepathically summoned him in December 1973.\nThe books explain that a long time ago, beings similar to us living on a distant planet discovered the secret of life and managed to create artificial living beings in a laboratory, thanks to their mastery over deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). These beings sought a planet in the universe where they could continue their experiments away from the scandalized public opinion of their world. After sending space probes throughout our galaxy, they found a planet with an atmosphere suitable for their intended experiment.\nThey landed on this planet, built laboratories, and worked freely. They created plants, animals, and finally, a being made \u0026ldquo;in their image,\u0026rdquo; humans. This planet was Earth. The Bible, according to this interpretation, does not recount the work of an all-powerful and immaterial god, but a fantastic scientific experiment conducted by beings to whom humanity owes its existence. These beings are referred to in the original Hebrew Bible not as \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; as some translations would have us believe, but as Elohim. This word means quite literally \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; in Hebrew and is clearly written in the plural form.\nThe Elohim, therefore, created humans in their image, as the Bible recounts. However, they were frightened by the aggression of their creation and expelled them from the laboratory, a place where everything was easy for them, where they were fed and housed without having to make any effort. This place is known as the \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo; or referred to as the \u0026ldquo;terrestrial paradise.\u0026rdquo;\nLater, the sons of Elohim became interested in the charms of human women, which is explicitly written in the Bible in Genesis, VI, 1,2, and 4: \u0026ldquo;The sons of Elohim saw that the daughters of men were beautiful. They took wives for themselves from all those they had chosen\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; When the sons of Elohim came to the daughters of men and they bore children to them, they were the heroes who were once men of renown.\u0026rdquo; This lead to hybrid offsprings.\nThis is also written in the Bible in Genesis, III, 22, in the passage where man learned from some of the scientists who loved them like their own children, that those they took for gods were just men like them: \u0026ldquo;Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, the government of the Elohim\u0026#39;s planet continued to believe that they should destroy the dangerous beings that had been created on Earth. The group that thought that men could only bring about evil, led by one of the Elohim known to us as Satan, eventually triumphed and the destruction of all life on Earth took place. This was the Great Flood, which was actually caused by an interstellar missile featuring a nuclear-type warhead.\nFortunately for us, a small group of the Elohim, believing that among men there were some who were good and deserved to survive, had preserved some of them as well as selected animal species in a spaceship, known as Noah\u0026#39;s Ark.\nA new settlement took place on Earth after this cataclysm, and the Elohim discovered at that time that they themselves had been created by beings from another planet and were, like us, the result of a scientific experiment in a laboratory. They then decided that they would never again seek to destroy humanity, letting it progress on its own.\nThey still decided to send messengers to men to teach them their origin by creating religions, whose scriptures would serve as proof when men reached a level of scientific knowledge sufficient to understand their origin without mysticism. Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and many others were among these messengers. Jesus, who was indeed the son of an Eloha and an Earth woman, rightly said, \u0026ldquo;my father who is in heaven.\u0026rdquo;\nThis era, which finally allows us to understand, is the one we are fortunate to live in today, the age of the Apocalypse, which we entered in 1945. Apocalypse is another mistranslated word, since in Greek it means revelation and not the end of the world as people have been led to believe.\nIt was written that the age of the Apocalypse would be there when the Jewish people found their country, and the State of Israel was recreated in our time; it was written that the age of the Apocalypse would be there when the blind could see, and it is now that American scientists are developing an electronic prosthesis grafted onto the optic nerve that will allow the blind to regain their sight; it was written that the age of the Apocalypse would be there when man\u0026rsquo;s voice would be carried beyond the oceans, and it is now thanks to satellite communications that we can correspond instantly with all corners of the world; it was written that the age of the Apocalypse would be there when man would equal \u0026ldquo;god,\u0026rdquo; the only one capable of creating life with inert materials, and it is now that scientists synthesize in the laboratory only with chemicals the first human gene, which allows them to envisage the creation of an artificial living being, thus equaling what was called \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;.\nAll of this was contained in the first book, in a much more developed form, of course. In the second, Rael recounted how the Elohim recontacted him in October 1975 in the Périgord, took him in one of their machines that men call \u0026ldquo;flying saucer\u0026rdquo; to one of their planets, where he was able to see extraordinary things that seem impossible or miraculous to us, just as it would have seemed impossible or miraculous to go from Paris to New York in less than four hours, thanks to the Concorde, to those who traveled there in a caravel in the time of Christopher Columbus and took several months to make the same journey.\nOn this planet, he met the great prophets like Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad who are scientifically kept alive and who will return to Earth as the scriptures announce in the company of the Elohim when the time comes. On this planet, called the planet of the Eternals, men live about seven hundred years then die and are recreated from one of their cells which is taken before their death and which contains the genetic code which is the plan of each individual.\nRael was able to witness the creation of a copy of himself made in a huge machine thanks to a cell that had been taken from the middle of his forehead and thus find himself for a few moments facing another himself.\nHe also learned that on this planet live eight thousand four hundred earthlings who have been admitted to be recreated after their earthly death to live there eternally. These beings were chosen for their actions during their life aimed at the development and progress of humanity. Indeed, a huge computer monitors each human from conception to death and notes all his actions. At the time of his death, if the balance shows more positive actions than negative, the being has the right to eternal life on the planet of the eternal Elohim, in the company of the great prophets.\nThe Elohim also taught Rael a meditation technique that allows a total awakening of the human mind, which only exploits a small part of its possibilities. This technique, called \u0026ldquo;sensual meditation,\u0026rdquo; allows man to situate himself in relation to the infinitely small that composes him and in relation to the infinitely large that he composes.\nThe Elohim also explained to Rael that they had been able to scientifically prove that on the atoms of the atoms that compose us there was intelligent life, other humanities, and that the earth and the stars are only atoms of a gigantic being who himself may be looking at another sky wondering if there are other inhabited planets\u0026hellip; They were therefore able to prove that the universe was infinite, and being infinite, that it could not have a center, which demonstrated that there could be no god or soul flying from the body after death.\nThey also explained that for intelligent beings living on an atom of our hand, one of our seconds represented several million years, just as our entire earthly life represented only a billionth of a billionth of a second for the gigantic being whose Earth is only the atom of an atom. This proving the incommunicability existing between the different levels of infinity in space, eliminating any idea of a \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; having power over men.\nThey explained that infinity exists in space, but also in time, nothing being created, everything being eternal either in the form of matter or in the form of energy, energy having no superiority over matter, as those who believe in \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; want to make believe.\nThe Elohim had asked Rael to create a movement charged with spreading on Earth the messages they had given him, and to build on our planet an embassy, located if possible near Jerusalem, where they would officially make contact with the governments of our world.\nThe Raelian Movement was created for this purpose and in 1979 brought together more than three thousand people who work in the hope of seeing the embassy built one day and our creators land there. It was also in 1979 that the third canonical book was published, Let\u0026rsquo;s Welcome The Extraterrestrials.\nSee also # Wiki › Neo-Euhemerism Read more # Resources › Rael.org Resources › The Book Which Tells The Truth Resources › Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet External links # Official website of the Raëlian Movement | Intelligent Design for Atheists Raëlism | Wikipedia Egyptian for Sun (\u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo;).

In Hinduism, this is achieved by attaining moksha, while in Buddhism it is achieved by attaining enlightenment, or nirvana.\nThe cycle of saṃsāra is driven by karma, which is the accumulation of one\u0026rsquo;s actions and intentions. One\u0026rsquo;s karma determines the circumstances of their birth and their experiences in life. Depending on the nature of their karma, a being may be reborn into a higher or lower state of existence, such as a human, animal, or spirit realm.\nThe cycle of saṃsāra is often depicted as a wheel, or the Bhavacakra, with twelve houses representing the different stages of life and existence. Breaking free from the cycle of saṃsāra requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the cessation of one\u0026rsquo;s attachment and aversion.\nThe Wheel of Life (Bhavacakra) # The Bhavacakra (Sanskrit: भवचक्र; Pāli: bhavacakka; Tibetan: སྲིད་པའི་འཁོར་ལོ, Wylie: srid pa\u0026rsquo;i \u0026lsquo;khor lo), also known as the Wheel of Life, is a symbolic representation of saṃsāra (or cyclic existence) is a symbolic representation of samsara, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in Buddhism. It is usually depicted as a wheel with twelve houses, each house representing a different aspect of samsara and its causes and effects.\nThe outer rim of the wheel depicts the twelve links of dependent origination, which show how ignorance and craving lead to suffering and rebirth. The three animals at the center of the wheel represent the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, which keep beings trapped in samsara. The image serves as a visual reminder of the Buddhist teachings on the nature of existence and the path to liberation.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the second book Book Which Tells The Truth, 2nd Chapter, Buddhism, Yahweh demystifies a core tenet of Buddhism:\nBuddhism explains that at the time of death, the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils, otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle. On the other hand, if it manages to escape those infamous devils, it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening.\nIn fact, this is a very good description, which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole. It must resist those devils, which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position to choose. Those \u0026ldquo;devils\u0026rdquo; are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature, and the \u0026ldquo;state of bliss through awakening\u0026rdquo; is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people, thus producing an earthly paradise, where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means.\nIf humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils, it will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world, with all the suffering which that entails.\nThat is why we can find the swastika in our symbol, as in numerous ancient writings, which signifies \u0026ldquo;the cycle\u0026rdquo;. It is the choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.\nAccording to the excerpt, the swastika is a symbol for the eternal recurrence, which is the idea that history repeats itself in cycles. The swastika is associated with the cycle because it represents the choice between a golden age of civilization, where science serves the people and creates an earthly paradise, and a primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it. In this context, the swastika symbolizes the choice between escaping the cycle of suffering and achieving a state of bliss through overcoming and awakening or being trapped in the cycle of reincarnation of the whole human species and growing another global civilization from anew.\nSee also # Wiki › Apocalypse Wiki › Golden Age Wiki › Swastika External links # Saṃsāra Bhavacakra | Wikipedia "},{"id":"142","href":"/wiki/satan/","title":"Satan","description":"Satan (śāṭān, Hebrew: שָׂטָן), not to be confused with Lucifer, is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the representative of a faction within the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) that opposes the existence of a prospering offspring civilization on Earth which is seen as a threat to their remote well-being. As such, Satan is not a proper name, but an indicative form of the role that Satan fills, namely that of an obstructor, of a prosecutor or even of an accuser.","content":"Satan, also commonly referred to as the Devil, is a figure in many religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In these traditions, Satan is often depicted as a powerful, malevolent spirit who opposes God and tempts humans to sin.\nIn the Bible, Satan is first mentioned in the book of Job as a member of God\u0026rsquo;s court who challenges Job\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness. Later, in the New Testament, Satan is depicted as a tempter who seeks to lead Jesus astray in the wilderness. In the Christian tradition, Satan is often seen as the embodiment of evil, the prince of demons, and the ruler of Hell.\nEtymology # The word Satan comes from the Hebrew word הַשָּׂטָן (ha-Satan), which means the accuser or the adversary. In the Hebrew Bible, the term Satan was used to refer to a divine being who acted as a prosecuting attorney in God\u0026rsquo;s court, accusing individuals of wrongdoing and testing their faithfulness. This understanding of Satan was adopted by early Christians and later became central to the development of the Christian idea of Satan as a tempter and the enemy of God.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Satan is an Eloha who opposes to the creation of other intelligent beings and believed that all beings on Earth, in particular the humans, should be destroyed due to their violence. Yahweh says the following about Satan:\nIn the Book of Job, Chapter 1, you have the explanation of Satan:\nNow there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.\n— Job 1: 6.\nElohim in Hebrew literally means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim. But one of these Elohim, called Satan, was part of a group, which had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on a planet as close as the Earth, seeing them as a possible threat. That is why, on seeing Job\u0026rsquo;s devotion, which was one of the best examples of human beings loving their creators, he said:\nDoth Job fear Elohim for nought?\u0026hellip; But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And Yahweh said unto Satan, \u0026lsquo;Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.\u0026rsquo;\n— Job 1: 9-12.\nHearing Satan\u0026rsquo;s assertion that had Job not been rich, he would not have loved his creators, the government gave full power to Satan to ruin Job. It would then be seen if he still venerated his creators, and that is why killing him was forbidden.\nOn seeing Job\u0026rsquo;s dedication to respecting his creators, even when he was ruined, the government triumphed over the opposition, Satan. But Satan retorted that though Job had lost many things, he was still in good health. So the government gave Satan carte blanche so long as he did not kill Job:\nBehold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.\n— Job 2: 6.\nThe passage discusses the story of Satan in the Book of Job, where Satan is one of the \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo; who report to their planet of origin about human behavior. Satan is part of a group that had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on Earth and viewed them as a possible threat. When Satan sees Job\u0026rsquo;s devotion to his creators, he questions whether Job would still love them if he were not rich. Satan is then given power to ruin Job to test his loyalty to the creators, with the condition that he does not kill him. Despite Job\u0026rsquo;s losses, he still respects and venerates his creators, which leads to the government\u0026rsquo;s triumph over Satan.\nIn Raël\u0026rsquo;s third book, the following is said about Satan:\nBut Satan doesn’t give up over this, as what he wishes is that all the beings that have been created, be totally destroyed, because he judges them to be dangerous, due to their violence. As time passes, Satan accumulates proof of Man’s aggression by observing the way in which humans kill each other with the weapons that are given to them by the sons of Lucifer’s exiled group of Elohim. The latter is involved in “tender” relations with the daughters of men who manage to receive weapons in exchange for their charms, under the false pretense of giving them to their fathers or brothers so that they can hunt for food. In fact, men choose to fight abominable battles among themselves with this arsenal.\nIn this excerpt, it is explained that Satan wants all beings to be destroyed because he considers them dangerous, due to their violence. He observes how humans kill each other with weapons provided by the exiled group of Elohim. The Elohim provide these weapons to the humans under the guise of using them for hunting, but the humans use them to engage in violent battles with each other. Satan accumulates proof of human aggression and uses it to support his belief that all beings should be destroyed.\nIn the given excerpts, Satan is portrayed as a being who believes that only evil can be expected from humans. He is opposed to the idea that there are positive and non-violent humans who are full of love and fraternity. Satan\u0026rsquo;s role appears to be one of accusing humans and presenting them in a negative light. It seems that he is not in favor of saving humanity from destruction and is more aligned with the belief that humanity is inherently evil.\nSee also # Wiki › Lucifer Wiki › Yahweh Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Raëlism External links # Satan | Wikipedia Satan | Britannica "},{"id":"143","href":"/resources/science-after-babel/","title":"Science After Babel","description":"\"Science After Babel\" by David Berlinski is a book that challenges the established norms and widely accepted theories in contemporary science.

Sendy argues that various ancient myths and religious traditions can be interpreted as evidence of extraterrestrial contact, and that this contact may have had a profound impact on the development of human culture\nIn this book, Sendy writes the following about what conditions need to be met in order to introduce his exegetical reading onto the Bible:\nTo make the Biblical text appear with the relief and coherence of a hologram, there are four conditions to be met: first, you must know the Bible; second, you must know the possibilities and limitations of astronautics within the framework of today\u0026rsquo;s physics; third, you must have some clear and recent knowledge, even if it is elementary, of biology, prehistory, history, and evolution; and fourth, you must reject any \u0026ldquo;explanation by the inexplicable\u0026rdquo;, that is, any intrusion of the supernatural.\nThere is also a fifth condition, an implicit one: you must have accepted the assumption of a universe intelligible to human reason.\n— page 182\nIn order to better understand the Biblical text, according to Jean Sendy, there are four key conditions that must be met: 1) knowledge of the Bible, 2) knowledge of astronautics within the context of today\u0026rsquo;s physics, 3) some knowledge of biology, prehistory, history, and evolution, and 4) rejection of supernatural explanations. Additionally, an implicit fifth condition is the acceptance of a universe that is intelligible to human reason.\nThe Five Conditions # The five conditions that Sendy mentions in his book can be seen as a blueprint on how to determine what conditions need to be met to assert the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible:\nFamiliarity with the contents of the Bible Familiarity with the current state of space science, in particular spaceflight Firm comprehension of a variety of scientific notions in biology, prehistory, history and evolution Repudiation of the supernatural Assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason The five conditions that Sendy lays out in his book \u0026ldquo;The Coming of the Gods\u0026rdquo; provide a blueprint for determining what conditions must be met to assert the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible.\nThe first condition, familiarity with the contents of the Bible, suggests that one must have a deep understanding of the text itself in order to interpret it accurately. A method that can be used to get familiar with the original meaning of Biblical scriptures is the so-called Biglino method, an alternative approach to interpreting the Bible, advocating for a literal understanding of its content rather than relying on figurative language or established exegesis.\nThe second condition, familiarity with the current state of space science, highlights the importance of understanding what is possible and impossible within the framework of contemporary physics and astronautics.\nThe third condition, a firm comprehension of a variety of scientific notions in biology, prehistory, history, and evolution, suggests that it is necessary to have a broad range of knowledge across scientific fields in order to interpret the text correctly. This includes an understanding of the historical and evolutionary contexts in which the text was written, as well as the scientific knowledge that has been gained since then.\nThe fourth condition, repudiation of the supernatural, implies that Sendy believed that the text should be interpreted without reference to divine intervention or other supernatural phenomena. This suggests that Sendy sought to interpret the text in a way that was consistent with modern scientific knowledge.\nThe fifth and final condition, an assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason, implies that Sendy believed that the text could be understood using human reasoning and scientific methods. This suggests that Sendy sought to interpret the text in a way that was consistent with contemporary scientific knowledge and rational inquiry.\nTaken together, these conditions suggest that Sendy believed that the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible could be supported through a careful, scientific analysis of the text that is grounded in a deep understanding of the Bible itself, as well as contemporary scientific knowledge across a broad range of fields.\nRejection of the supernatural # Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s assertion that the universe is intelligible to human reason and that the supernatural should be repudiated when interpreting the Bible reflects a philosophical and epistemological perspective that is closely aligned with naturalism and scientific realism.\nNaturalism is a philosophical position that holds that the natural world, including human beings, can be explained by natural causes and laws. It is a rejection of supernatural explanations, and it asserts that the world is knowable through scientific inquiry and human reason. Sendy\u0026rsquo;s rejection of the supernatural in interpreting the Bible is consistent with this naturalistic perspective.\nScientific realism, on the other hand, is an epistemological perspective that holds that scientific theories provide true descriptions of the world, and that the entities and processes posited by science are real and exist independently of our observations of them. This perspective is grounded in the belief that the natural world is orderly and intelligible, and that scientific inquiry can provide a reliable understanding of the world. Sendy\u0026rsquo;s assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason is consistent with this scientific realist perspective.\nThe combination of naturalism and scientific realism reflected in Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work suggests an affinity with a broader philosophical tradition known as empiricism. Empiricism is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of observation and experience in the formation of knowledge, and it holds that knowledge can only be derived from the senses. Empiricists reject metaphysical explanations and seek to ground their understanding of the world in empirical evidence and scientific inquiry.\nIn summary, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s rejection of the supernatural and his assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason are consistent with a naturalistic and scientific realist perspective that is rooted in the empiricist tradition. These perspectives emphasize the importance of observation and scientific inquiry in the formation of knowledge, and they reject metaphysical or supernatural explanations.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Raëlism shares some similarities with Sendy\u0026rsquo;s perspective, in that it also incorporates a belief in extraterrestrial life and seeks to reconcile science and religion. Another similarity is their shared beliefs about extraterrestrial life and the possibility of alien intervention in human history.\nBoth Sendy and Raëlism suggest that extraterrestrial life is possible and that alien beings have visited Earth in the past. They also share an interest in the idea that ancient texts, such as the Bible, may contain references to extraterrestrial life or evidence of alien intervention in human history. More specifically, Raëlians view the universe as fundamentally physical and material, and they reject the notion of a supernatural or divine realm.\nIn terms of interpreting the Bible, Raëlism takes a naturalistic and scientific approach that is similar in some respects to the approach taken by Jean Sendy. Raëlians reject traditional religious interpretations of the Bible and seek to uncover what they believe to be the scientific truths that are hidden within the text. They believe that the Bible contains references to extraterrestrial life and that it is a guide to understanding the nature of the universe and humanity\u0026rsquo;s place within it.\nSee also # Wiki › Bible Wiki › Biglino Method Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Neo-Euhemerism External links # Jean Sendy | Wikipedia "},{"id":"146","href":"/wiki/serpent/","title":"Serpent","description":"Serpent, a metaphorical reference to an unruly faction among the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים).

One of the lead protagonists of this faction is known as Lucifer, the light-bringer.","content":"The Biblical Serpent refers to a serpent mentioned in the book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the biblical story, the serpent was a creature that appeared in the Garden of Eden and tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. This event is often seen as the first act of sin and disobedience, and is believed to have caused humanity to fall from a state of innocence and purity into a state of sin and mortality.\nIn the Bible # In the Bible, the serpent is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 3. In the Hebrew source text, the serpent is written נָחָשׁ (nakhásh)1 and plays a significant role in the account of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. According to the biblical narrative, the serpent is depicted as cunning and deceptive.\nIn Genesis 3:1, the serpent is introduced: \u0026ldquo;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Elohim had made.\u0026rdquo; The serpent approaches Eve and engages her in a conversation, questioning the command given by the Elohim regarding eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\nThroughout the dialogue between the serpent and Eve, the serpent deceives her, suggesting that eating the forbidden fruit will not lead to death but rather to becoming like the Elohim, knowing good and evil. Eve eventually succumbs to the serpent\u0026rsquo;s temptation and eats the fruit, followed by Adam.\nIn Mesopotamian accounts # In Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology, there are references to a serpent-like entity known as the \u0026ldquo;šēdu\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mušḫuššu.\u0026rdquo; The Sumerian civilization, which predates Babylonian culture, also has serpent-like creatures mentioned in their mythology, such as the \u0026ldquo;ukum\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mushmahhu.\u0026rdquo; While there are different variations and interpretations across Mesopotamian and Sumerian texts, these entities generally share certain characteristics.\nIn Mesopotamian mythology, the šēdu or mušḫuššu is often depicted as a hybrid creature with the body of a lion or a lion-dragon combination, and the head of a serpent or a snake-like creature. It is associated with chaos, destruction, and serves as a guardian or protector. The šēdu or mušḫuššu is sometimes portrayed as having wings, further emphasizing its formidable nature.\nSimilarly, in Sumerian mythology, the ukum or mušmaḫḫū is described as a serpent-like monster associated with chaos and the underworld. It is often depicted with multiple heads and is considered a powerful and dangerous creature.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # In his book The Naked Bible author Biglino provides an intriguing perspective on the identity of the Biblical serpent.\n“In all seriousness, this ‘serpent’ was one of the Elohim who belonged to the faction of those who were hostile to, or even an enemy of, the Elohim who ruled in the Gan Eden2.”3\nAccording to Biglino, this enigmatic creature can be understood as one of the Elohim, a divine group that belonged to a faction opposing or even hostile to the ruling Elohim in the Garden of Eden.\nBiglino delves deeper into the role of the serpentine faction of the Elohim and its impact on the expulsion of the Adamites from the Garden of Eden:\n“The Adamites,” Biglino reiterates, “are driven out because they had become reproductively independent. This should never have happened. And, above all, the breeding between the Adamites and a member of the lineage of the Elohim, which in the Bible is represented by the ‘snake’, should never have happened either. Their interbreeding was the real cause behind the expulsion of the Adamites from Gan Eden.”\nIt is no coincidence, Biglino adds, that the commander of the ‘garden’ tells the Adamites, “I will put enmity between your lineage and that of the serpent.”\nSo, the scholar observes, we are talking about two lineages, two distinct groups in conflict with each other.\n“The lineage of the serpent is the one directly descended from the sexual act that the serpent – a rival Elohim – had performed with Eve, which resulted in the birth of Cain. Later on, Adam and Eve had other children, but while Cain was the son of Eve and the Serpent, the others were of direct Adamite lineage.”4\nAccording to Biglino, the Adamites were driven out due to their newfound reproductive independence, which was never meant to occur. Moreover, their interbreeding with a member of the Elohim lineage, symbolized by the \u0026lsquo;snake\u0026rsquo; in the Bible, served as a significant factor behind their expulsion. This act of interbreeding led to the birth of Cain, who belonged to the lineage of the serpent, while the other children of Adam and Eve remained of direct Adamite lineage. Biglino highlights the conflict between these two distinct groups, emphasizing the significance of this lineage division.\nBiglino further asserts that the actions of the Serpentine faction were the underlying cause of the Great Flood:\nAnd what about the Great Flood?\n“It served the purpose of ‘cleansing’ the Earth (or at least that region) of the ‘serpent lineage’, which must have spread rampantly, ruining the very selective initial plans of the Gan Eden geneticists.”5\nAccording to Biglino, the occurrence of the Great Flood served a purpose beyond mere destruction, functioning as a means to restore order and rectify the genetic deviations caused by the intermingling of the serpent lineage with human beings.\nIn his analysis, Biglino strongly emphasizes that the Biblical Serpent should not be associated with Satan, contrary to common assumptions:\n“Satan has even been connected with the serpent that tempted Eve, but there is actually no trace of this link in the Bible.”6\nBiglino\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint challenges the traditional understanding that the Serpent in the Garden of Eden represents Satan. He argues that the Bible does not provide any explicit link between the two entities.\nAs a symbol # Biglino highlights that, apart from a literal interpretation, the choice of a serpent as a symbol in the biblical narrative can also be understood figuratively:\nIn the past, says Biglino, as a premise, the snake always had a positive connotation: being an animal that nests in the ground, it symbolized the individual who digs and goes deep into knowledge.\n“The term ‘snake’, in fact, also has the meaning of possessor of knowledge. The double serpent could therefore represent profound knowledge, with particular reference to the double helix of DNA.”\nBy exploring the symbolic nature of the serpent which used to be connotated positively, he expands the understanding of the serpentine faction\u0026rsquo;s role as a representation of advanced scientific and technological knowledge. Moreover, Biglino suggests that the allusion to the serpent in the biblical narrative can be seen as a direct reference to genetics:\nSo would this be a way to allude directly to genetics?\n“This is true deep knowledge, the knowledge possessed above all by geneticists, who know the most intimate part of human structure. From there, the representation of the snake then came to symbolize those who deal with this type of information and who possess this kind of technology. In essence, the art of medicine.”\nAccording to Biglino, the serpent serves as a metaphorical representation of the specialized knowledge held by geneticists and their ability to manipulate and comprehend the intricate workings of human biology.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # The Serpent refers to a group of scientists led by Lucifer who revealed the true nature of the creators to the first humans, which ultimately led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.\nAccording to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of engineering Elohim disobeyed and came to be known as the Serpent:\nSome scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their \u0026ldquo;creatures\u0026rdquo;, and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.\nAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.\n— Genesis 3: 7.\nThe new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.\nAnd Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, \u0026lsquo;Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed\u0026hellip; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\u0026rsquo;\n— Genesis 3: 14.\nThe \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.\nIn this passage, a team of scientists on Earth create human beings who are almost as intelligent as their creators. However, the creators are cautious and keep the scientific books away from the young human beings, wanting to ensure they don\u0026rsquo;t surpass their own knowledge. But some of the creators take pity on the humans and decide to give them a complete education so that they too can become scientists. The humans become angry with their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them in ignorance, and the creators who tried to help them are cursed and exiled to Earth. The \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; referred to in the Bible is actually this small group of creators who wanted to share knowledge with the humans.\nSee also # Wiki › Adam and Eve Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Lucifer Wiki › Leviathan External links # Serpent in the Bible | Wikipedia The Hebrew word used in the Bible is נָחָשׁ (nakhásh) and clearly denotes the snake animal. However, the Proto-Semitic root of נָחָשׁ is naḥaš-, which in Akkadian is nēšum (𒌨𒈤, pronounced as UR.MAḪ in Sumerian), meaning lion. In Akkadian, the word for serpent is also written as 𒌨𒈤𒊭𒆕𒋡𒊑 (nēšu ša qaqqari), literally meaning “lion of the ground”, where 𒆕𒋡𒊑 (qaqqarum) means the ground or earth. The Hebrew cognate of 𒆕𒋡𒊒 is קַרְקַע (karká\u0026rsquo;) and both share the Proto-Semitic root *ḳarḳar- which is best represented by the Sumerian logogram 𒆠 (KI), all denoting the ground as a surface. On another note, If the Sumerian logogram for lion 𒌨𒈤 (UR.MAḪ) is prefixed with the Sumerian logogram of stars 𒀯 also explicitely denotes the Zodiac sign of Leo 𒀯𒌨𒈤 (mulUR.MAȞ).

This faction was in rebellion against the ruling government on their home planet, led by the president of the Council of Eternals, Yahweh. After the Great Flood, an armed confrontation occurred both on Earth and in the surrounding space.","content":"Sequence of events # The Serpentine Rebellion signifies an epoch-spanning act of defiance that began in the Age of Leo. During this period, the Elohimite scientists, also simply called the creators, who were doing extensive research and engineering life for many millenia on Earth by then, were granted permission to create human life on Earth in their image, under the condition that their humanoid creations would not bear their likeness in aptitude. This directive came from their government, which insisted that the Elohim maintain an illusion of divinity to their creations.\nLucifer, leading one of the scientific teams engaged in genetic engineering, defied this decree after observing the remarkable potential of their synthetic humans. Contrary to the government\u0026rsquo;s mandate, Lucifer revealed to these early humans, the Adamites, that their creators were mortal beings from another planet. This act of defiance symbolized his transformation into \u0026ldquo;the bearer of light,\u0026rdquo; shedding enlightenment upon the first men.\nThis act of rebellion did not go unpunished. Yahweh, the president of the Council of Eternals – the highest governing body on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet – condemned the insubordinate scientists to eternal exile on Earth. This punishment led to the eviction of humanity from their idyllic environment, known as the \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo;. This marked the inception of the metaphorical \u0026ldquo;Serpent\u0026rdquo; that would crawl upon the Earth in defiance of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s rule.\nMeanwhile, an Elohim named Satan proposed a severe course of action. Viewing humanity as intrinsically violent and potentially hazardous, he championed their total extermination. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group, now exiled on Earth, further complicated the situation. Their intimate relations with humans led to the exchange of advanced weaponry and the birth of hybrid offspring. This unexpected development, coupled with mounting evidence of human violence, persuaded Yahweh to authorize the eradication of life on Earth, giving Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group a pathway to redemption and termination of their exile.\nHowever, the impending destruction of their creations was a scenario the exiled Elohim could not accept. They identified potential in humanity and resolved to save a select few, including a man named Noah, known for his embodiment of love and fraternity. The exiled Elohim aided Noah in building a spacecraft designed to orbit Earth during the cataclysm, thereby preserving a part of humanity and the genetic codes of various animal species. This spacecraft, commonly known as Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, safeguarded a select group of humans and the genetic blueprints of various animal species, thereby ensuring the renaissance of life on Earth post-catastrophe.\nAfter the Great Flood had passed and life recreated, the Serpentine rebellion continued to evolve as humanity, specifically the Adamites who came to be known as the Jews, made astonishing progress in their intellectual development. Guided by their exiled creators, the Adamites were soon ready to embark on a monumental quest—the conquest of space. The exiled creators sought to achieve forgiveness from the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government through this endeavor, by demonstrating the peaceful and intelligent nature of their synthetic humans.\nAn enormous interstellar rocket, referred to as the Tower of Babel, was constructed for this purpose. It was a symbol of humanity\u0026rsquo;s aspirations and the limitless potential of their collective ability. The sentiment resonated with the words from Genesis 11:6, \u0026ldquo;And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, the people on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet perceived this development as a threat. Despite expecting Earth to be devoid of life, they had continued observing the planet and were alarmed at the rapid progress. The creation of the Tower of Babel and the impending interstellar journey was a direct challenge to the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. They saw it as a violation of their imposed limitations on humanity, essentially viewing it as an armed insurrection. In a strategic move to hinder the progress, they decided to confound the language of the Jews and scatter them across the globe. As mentioned in Genesis 11:7-8, \u0026ldquo;Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\u0026rdquo; This dispersion of the Jews, the most scientifically knowledgeable among the Adamites, halted their advancements by placing them among primitive tribes with different languages. It led to the loss of their scientific instruments and halted the construction of the Tower of Babel, thus obstructing the interstellar journey to seek pardon.\nHowever, these measures were not sufficient to quell the rebellion. The exiled creators, referred to metaphorically as the \u0026ldquo;Serpent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Leviathan,\u0026rdquo; had taken refuge in the depths of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans. Isaiah 27:1 reads, \u0026ldquo;In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\u0026rdquo; This verse hints at the continued animosity of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government towards the exiled creators. They saw the exiled creators\u0026rsquo; support of humanity\u0026rsquo;s interstellar project as an act of aggression, further fueling their desire to punish them.\nIn response to this defiant act, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government declared war on the Serpent, marking the onset of Theomachy. The verse from Isaiah 27:1, \u0026ldquo;In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea,\u0026rdquo; alludes to this conflict. The Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government, symbolized by Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;sore and great and strong sword,\u0026rdquo; sought to annihilate the Serpent, the exiled creators who dared to challenge their authority.\nWhile the details of the conflict are not known, the Theomachy, a cosmic war that erupted between the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government and the Serpent (the exiled creators led by Lucifer), ended with the defeat of the Serpent. Despite their defiance and resilience, the Serpent could not match the power of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. The victory of the Elohim marked the end of the rebellion and opened up a new chapter in the relationship between humanity, their creators, and their home planet.\nIn a turn of events, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government pardoned the Serpent, allowing them to return to their home planet. The creators, upon returning, advocated for humanity, their creation, swaying the sentiment of their home planet towards Earth and its inhabitants. This crucial act marked the beginning of a new phase, fostering a new understanding and alliance between humanity and the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet.\nHowever, the resolution of the rebellion did not guarantee lasting peace on Earth. Among the scattered humans, a few harbored a desire for vengeance. They congregated in the cities of the Plain, known as Sodom and Gomorrah, intending to utilize salvaged scientific knowledge for a retaliatory mission against those who had tried to destroy them. In response, the creators sent two spies to assess the situation.\nWhen the spies arrived in Sodom, they faced hostility from the vengeful humans. Using an atomic weapon, the spies neutralized their attackers, causing them blindness as noted in Genesis 19:11, \u0026ldquo;And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great.\u0026rdquo; The spies warned the peaceful inhabitants to leave the town, intending to annihilate the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah to prevent the escalation of hostility.\nThe subsequent atomic obliteration of Sodom and Gomorrah marked the definitive end of the rebellion, quelling any remaining hostility and aspiration for vengeance. With this act, the Serpentine rebellion came to an end.\nSee also # Wiki › Adamite struggle Wiki › Elohimian Space Wars Wiki › Lucifer Wiki › Leviathan Wiki › Adamite struggle Wiki › Yahweh "},{"id":"148","href":"/resources/signature-in-the-cell/","title":"Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design","description":"\"The Human History Mistake: The Neanderthals and other Inventions of the Evolution and Earth Sciences\" is a work by German author Hans-Joachim Zillmer that challenges conventional views on human evolution and the age of archaeological findings. Zillmer argues that numerous Stone Age artifacts, including the skulls of Neanderthals and individuals from the Paleolithic era, are much younger than traditionally believed. He contends that these should be dated as young as a few thousand or even hundreds of years, rather than the accepted timeline of 27,000 years or more.","content":"\u0026ldquo;Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design\u0026rdquo; is a 2009 book by philosopher and intelligent design advocate Stephen C. Meyer. In this work, Meyer presents the argument that the digital code within DNA points to a designing intelligence as the best explanation for the origin of life. He discusses the problem of how life emerged from lifeless matter, a crucial event that must have occurred before biological evolution could begin.\nMeyer\u0026rsquo;s approach is grounded in what he defines as historical science, which seeks to establish past causes of events using three criteria: the presence of a proposed cause, evidence that this cause can produce the event in question, and the absence of other plausible causes. Applying this framework, Meyer contends that chemical evolution, chance, and chemical necessity have not been demonstrated to be capable of producing the information-rich systems found in DNA and proteins. He thus posits intelligent design as the most viable explanation for the emergence of life on Earth.\nThe book has found a receptive audience within some conservative, intelligent design, and evangelical communities. However, it has also been the subject of criticism and controversy. Philosopher Thomas Nagel notably included it in the \u0026ldquo;2009 Books of the Year\u0026rdquo; supplement for The Times, which prompted criticism from others in the scientific community. Chemist Stephen Fletcher, for instance, challenged the factual accuracy of the book’s claims, particularly regarding natural selection and the role of RNA in evolution. Darrel Falk of the BioLogos Foundation and a biology professor used the book to illustrate his opposition to the intelligent design movement.\nAdditionally, organizations like the American Scientific Affiliation, a Christian group of scientists, have published detailed analyses of the book\u0026rsquo;s claims, and developmental biologist Steve Matheson has critiqued the book for its arguments supporting intelligent design. These critiques indicate that while the book has influenced the discussion on life\u0026rsquo;s origins and the debate over intelligent design, it also has faced substantial criticism from the scientific community​.\nAbout Stephen C. Meyer # Stephen C. Meyer is an American scholar, philosopher, and prominent advocate for intelligent design, a controversial viewpoint that posits certain features of the universe and living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. Meyer earned his Ph.D. in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge. He is a founder of the Discovery Institute\u0026rsquo;s Center for Science and Culture (CSC), a key institution in the intelligent design movement. Meyer has been influential through his writings and public speaking, particularly in arguing against the exclusively naturalistic explanations for the origins of life and the development of biological complexity. His most notable works include \u0026ldquo;Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design,\u0026rdquo; both of which have played a significant role in framing the intelligent design debate. While Meyer’s work has been well-received within certain circles, it has also attracted substantial criticism from the mainstream scientific community, which generally regards intelligent design as a form of creationism lacking empirical support.\nExternal links # Stephen C.

God sent two angels to visit the city of Sodom to see if the reports of its wickedness were true. When the people of Sodom demanded that the angels be handed over to them so they could be sexually abused, the angels blinded the people and warned Lot, a righteous man who lived in the city, to flee with his family.\nGod then destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone, raining down on the cities from the sky, killing all the people who lived there.

It involves the deliberate modification or creation of genetic material and the engineering of biological components to program living cells to perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits. Synthetic biology aims to understand and re-engineer biological systems.","content":"Relationship with synthetic genomics # Synthetic biology and synthetic genomics are closely related fields, but there are subtle differences between the two:\nSynthetic biology: Synthetic biology, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of activities and approaches. It involves the application of engineering principles to design and construct biological systems or components with novel functions. Synthetic biology encompasses the design and engineering of genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, proteins, and other biological modules to create new organisms or modify existing ones. It integrates various disciplines such as biology, genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to create synthetic biological systems that can perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits.\nSynthetic genomics: Synthetic genomics primarily focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes. It involves the creation of artificial DNA sequences that mimic or differ from existing natural genomes. Synthetic genomics often aims to understand the minimal set of genes necessary for a living organism\u0026rsquo;s functioning and can involve the creation of synthetic chromosomes or even entire synthetic genomes. It is a branch of genetic engineering that deals specifically with the construction of genetic material.\nSynthetic genomics focuses on the creation of artificial genomes or large segments of genomes, while synthetic biology encompasses a wider range of activities, including the design and construction of genetic circuits, proteins, and other biological components, to create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic genomics can be considered a subset of synthetic biology that specifically deals with the construction of genetic material.\nProtein engineering # Protein engineering is a sub-discipline of synthetic biology that involves the design and construction of new proteins or the modification of existing proteins to create desired properties or functions. This field emerged from the understanding that proteins, as the primary functional units of cellular processes, hold enormous potential in various areas including therapeutics, industrial processes, and new materials. The process of protein engineering entails understanding the intricate relationship between a protein\u0026rsquo;s amino acid sequence, its three-dimensional structure, and its function.\nProtein engineering is at the heart of synthetic biology, because proteins often serve as the functional units that carry out the tasks necessary for a synthetic biological system. Proteins can be engineered to function as enzymes, signal transducers, or structural elements, among other roles. By engineering these proteins, scientists can custom-build biological systems to carry out specific tasks, creating new opportunities for biotechnology.\nThere are two primary methods used in protein engineering: rational design and directed evolution.\nRational design # Rational design involves the use of computational methods and deep understanding of protein structure and function to predict changes that could enhance or modify protein function. This method requires a detailed knowledge of the protein\u0026rsquo;s structure and biochemistry.\nBioinformatic tools, molecular modeling software, and protein databases are often used to create in silico models of protein structures. These models help scientists predict the effects of specific amino acid changes. Once a desired change is identified, genetic engineering techniques are used to alter the DNA sequence encoding the protein, thus producing the engineered protein.\nDirected evolution # In contrast to rational design, directed evolution is an iterative process that emulates natural evolution at a high speed. This method does not require prior understanding of the protein\u0026rsquo;s structure or detailed mechanistic insight into its function.\nDirected evolution involves the generation of a large library of protein variants, typically through random mutagenesis of the DNA sequence that encodes for the protein. This library is then subjected to a screening or selection process, wherein protein variants that exhibit the desired trait or function are isolated. The selected proteins are then used as the starting point for another round of mutation and selection, thus iteratively evolving the protein towards a desired function.\nDirected evolution has been extremely successful in engineering proteins with properties that could not have been predicted with rational design alone. It is now a widely used method for protein engineering, and its conceptual breakthrough and impact on protein engineering were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018.\nArtifical gene synthesis # Artificial gene synthesis, also known simply as gene synthesis, refers to the process by which scientists construct genetic material de novo, or from scratch. This process enables the creation of DNA sequences that might be difficult or impossible to generate through traditional molecular cloning or PCR amplification techniques.\nThe process of gene synthesis begins with the design of the desired DNA sequence. This sequence is often designed in silico, using bioinformatic tools to optimize the sequence for the desired expression system and to eliminate potential issues such as unwanted secondary structures or sequence motifs that could hinder the desired function.\nOnce the sequence is designed, it is synthesized in the lab using chemical methods. The method most commonly used for gene synthesis is the phosphoramidite method, in which individual nucleotides are added to a growing DNA chain in a stepwise fashion. This process starts from the 3\u0026rsquo; end of the DNA and proceeds to the 5\u0026rsquo; end, which is the opposite of the direction of DNA synthesis in living organisms.\nAfter the synthesis of individual DNA fragments, these fragments are assembled into a full-length gene. This is often done using methods such as Gibson assembly, in which overlapping ends of the DNA fragments are joined together by an enzyme that simultaneously removes the overlap and seals the DNA backbone.\nThe resulting synthetic gene can then be inserted into a plasmid or other vector for further use, such as transformation into a host organism or incorporation into a larger piece of synthetic DNA.\nDe novo synthesis # The term \u0026ldquo;de novo\u0026rdquo; is Latin for \u0026ldquo;from the new,\u0026rdquo; and in the context of gene synthesis, it means creating a DNA sequence from scratch rather than using existing DNA as a template. De novo gene synthesis allows for the creation of DNA sequences that do not exist in nature or have been significantly altered from a natural template. This enables the design of completely new genes with desired properties, a capability that is central to the field of synthetic biology.\nIn Raëlism # In the Age of Scorpio, the Third Day of Creation, Yahweh says the following about what happened:\nLet the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth. Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. […]\nIn the Raëlian canon, the quoted passage from Genesis describes an act of creation through synthetic biology, in the context of the narrative provided. It seems to depict the engineering of vegetation on Earth, a feat supposedly accomplished by the Elohim.\n\u0026ldquo;Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth,\u0026rdquo; a verse from Genesis, describes the creation of vegetation. In the context of the Raëlian narrative, this is interpreted not as a divine act, but as a deliberate, scientific endeavor undertaken by the Elohim.\nThe second paragraph appears to describe this process in more detail. \u0026ldquo;In this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants.\u0026rdquo; This is an account of synthetic biology on a grand scale, where the Elohim are said to have created cells - the fundamental units of life - from simple chemicals. The statement reflects the aspirations of synthetic biology to create life from non-living components.\nThe passage further states that \u0026ldquo;All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own.\u0026rdquo; This highlights a critical goal of synthetic biology: to create not just individual organisms, but self-sustaining systems. For synthetic life to be viable, it must be capable of reproduction, of sustaining itself beyond the initial act of creation. This ability for independent reproduction is a defining characteristic of life, and its replication in a synthetic context represents a significant achievement.\nOutlook # Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. By merging the principles of engineering, biology, and computer science, it is pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in biological systems.\nThe creation of entirely new forms of life, as suggested in the narrative with the Elohim, lies within the realm of synthetic biology\u0026rsquo;s future potential. Today, synthetic biology is most commonly applied in the redesign of existing biological systems, for instance, by engineering bacteria to produce biofuels, or yeast to generate medicines. However, the long-term vision of many synthetic biologists extends to creating entirely new forms of life that do not exist in nature.\nThe key to this is a detailed understanding and control over the genetic material that governs life: DNA. By reading and writing DNA sequences, scientists can control the function of cells and organisms. This is where artificial gene synthesis and particularly de novo synthesis come in. As mentioned, de novo synthesis refers to the ability to create DNA sequences from scratch, without using existing DNA as a template. This allows for the design and creation of entirely new genes, and ultimately new organisms, with desired properties.\nMoreover, the creation of synthetic genomes, such as the minimal bacterial genome created by the J. Craig Venter Institute, represents a significant step towards the creation of entirely new life forms. A synthetic genome could, in theory, be designed and synthesized to encode the functions for a completely novel organism.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that creating a new life form is not just about creating new DNA sequences. Other biological components like proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and the intricate mechanisms of cellular machinery all play critical roles in the functioning of a life form.\nTherefore, while synthetic biology provides the tools and framework that could make the creation of new life forms possible, we are still at the early stages of this ambitious endeavor. The ethical, societal, and environmental considerations of such advancements are also subjects of ongoing and critical debate.\nSee also # Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Life engineering Wiki › Synthetic genomics External links # Synthetic biology | Wikipedia "},{"id":"154","href":"/wiki/synthetic-genomics/","title":"Synthetic genomics","description":"Synthetic genomics is a branch of genetic engineering that focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes.

It involves the construction of artificial genetic material to explore and manipulate the genetic basis of life.","content":"Relationship with synthetic biology # Synthetic genomics and synthetic biology are closely related fields, but there are subtle differences between the two:\nSynthetic genomics: Synthetic genomics primarily focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes. It involves the creation of artificial DNA sequences that mimic or differ from existing natural genomes. Synthetic genomics often aims to understand the minimal set of genes necessary for a living organism\u0026rsquo;s functioning and can involve the creation of synthetic chromosomes or even entire synthetic genomes. It is a branch of genetic engineering that deals specifically with the construction of genetic material.\nSynthetic biology: Synthetic biology, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of activities and approaches. It involves the application of engineering principles to design and construct biological systems or components with novel functions. Synthetic biology encompasses the design and engineering of genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, proteins, and other biological modules to create new organisms or modify existing ones. It integrates various disciplines such as biology, genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to create synthetic biological systems that can perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits.\nSynthetic genomics focuses on the creation of artificial genomes or large segments of genomes, while synthetic biology encompasses a wider range of activities, including the design and construction of genetic circuits, proteins, and other biological components, to create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic genomics can be considered a subset of synthetic biology that specifically deals with the construction of genetic material.\nA branch of synthetic biology # Synthetic genomics is a branch of synthetic biology that involves the design and construction of complete genomes from scratch, which can then be used to create entirely new organisms or significantly modify existing ones. This scientific discipline is characterized by the scale of its ambition: while other areas of genetic engineering might involve altering or adding a few genes, synthetic genomics aspires to construct and manipulate entire genomes.\nThe foundation of synthetic genomics lies in the understanding and manipulation of DNA, the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions for life. Scientists have been reading DNA for decades, in the sense of sequencing genomes to determine their content. The advent of synthetic genomics, however, has introduced the capacity to write DNA, to design and construct DNA sequences with desired characteristics. This capacity is grounded in advances in technologies for artificial gene synthesis and genome assembly.\nArtifical gene synthesis # Artificial gene synthesis refers to the laboratory process of creating DNA molecules from nucleotide building blocks. This process, which is also used in other areas of genetic engineering, is carried out using automated machines called DNA synthesizers. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, this technology allows the synthesis of DNA molecules up to a few thousand base pairs in length.\nCreating an entire genome, however, often requires millions or even billions of base pairs, far beyond the reach of current gene synthesis technology. To overcome this limitation, synthetic genomics relies on methods for assembling smaller pieces of synthetic DNA into larger ones. These methods, which include techniques such as Gibson assembly and yeast homologous recombination, can join multiple pieces of DNA together in a specific order to create a larger DNA molecule.\nAchievements # Severals achievements have already been recorded in the field of synthetic genomics.\nCreation of the first synthetic cell # One of the landmark achievements in synthetic genomics was the creation of the first synthetic cell by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2010. This project involved the design and synthesis of a bacterial genome based on the sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides. The synthetic genome was then transplanted into a recipient cell of a different species, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing its genome and effectively converting the cell into the synthetic species. This represented the first creation of a cell controlled entirely by a synthetic genome.\nCreation of the first entirely computer-made bacterial genome # In April 2019, a team of researchers from ETH Zurich made a significant stride in synthetic genomics, announcing the creation of the world\u0026rsquo;s first bacterial genome constructed entirely by a computer. The synthetic organism was named Caulobacter ethensis-2.0, in recognition of the team\u0026rsquo;s institution and the original bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, from which the synthetic genome was derived.\nCaulobacter crescentus is a well-studied bacterium known for its asymmetric cell division and is a model organism for cellular biology. By leveraging a deep understanding of the natural bacterium, the researchers were able to design a significantly simplified version of its genome on the computer. This synthetic genome incorporated only the genes deemed essential for life, a subset of the total genes found in the natural bacterium.\nOnce the genome design was complete, the sequence was synthesized in the laboratory. This process involved the chemical construction of the DNA molecule corresponding to the designed sequence. Due to the size of the genome, it was synthesized in pieces and then assembled into the complete genome.\nAt the time of their announcement, the scientists had not yet created a viable bacterium with the synthetic genome. The synthesizing of the genome was completed, but the researchers were still in the process of transplanting the synthetic genome into a bacterial cell, a complex and delicate process.\nThe creation of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 represents a significant advance in synthetic genomics. By designing and constructing a complete bacterial genome, the ETH Zurich team brought the field a step closer to the creation of entirely synthetic organisms. The eventual achievement of a viable Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 would offer a powerful new tool for studying the fundamentals of life and could pave the way for custom-built synthetic organisms with wide-ranging applications. However, this breakthrough also emphasizes the ethical and safety considerations that must be addressed as the field of synthetic genomics continues to advance.\nApplications # The potential applications of synthetic genomics are vast. In theory, organisms could be custom-built to perform specific tasks, such as producing biofuels, recycling waste, or producing pharmaceuticals. In addition, synthetic genomics could provide a powerful tool for studying fundamental questions in biology, such as the minimal set of genes required for life.\nOutlook # Synthetic genomics could play a crucial role in creating life on another planet, as it provides the necessary tools for designing and creating entirely new life forms from scratch. This potential capability becomes increasingly relevant when considering life in a pan-tropic context, meaning adapting organisms to survive and thrive in various, and possibly extreme, environmental conditions as they might be found on other planets.\nAt its core, synthetic genomics revolves around understanding, designing, and manipulating entire genomes. This not only includes the ability to make minor alterations to existing organisms but also the potential to create novel organisms tailor-made for specific environments.\nWhen considering life on another planet, the conditions could be drastically different from those on Earth, encompassing variations in temperature, gravity, atmospheric composition, radiation levels, and availability of water and other necessary elements. These are conditions under which Earth life may not survive or function efficiently. Synthetic genomics could provide a solution by enabling the creation of life forms designed specifically for these conditions.\nFor instance, genes associated with radiation resistance, extreme temperature tolerance, or metabolic pathways that can utilize non-Earth like biochemistry could be included in the design of a synthetic genome. These synthetic organisms could be created and tested in simulated extraterrestrial environments here on Earth before any interplanetary missions.\nSuch an endeavor is aligned with the narrative of the Elohim as described in the Raëlian tradition, wherein these advanced beings had supposedly reached a point of technological sophistication that allowed them to create life. If the narrative is to be believed, the Elohim would likely have used something akin to synthetic genomics, combined with other advanced technologies, to create organisms adapted to the specific conditions of Earth, thereby seeding life here.\nSee also # Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Genetic engineering Wiki › Life engineering Wiki › Synthetic biology External links # Synthetic genomics | Wikipedia "},{"id":"155","href":"/resources/tanakh/","title":"Tanakh","description":"The Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible, is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a significant part of Christian scriptures.

At fourteen, he apprenticed with Bradbury and Evans in London to learn banknote engraving, where he excelled. He was captivated by Assyrian culture and history from a young age, reading extensively on the subject in his spare time. His passion led him to spend lunch hours at the British Museum, studying cuneiform tablets discovered near Mosul, Iraq by Layard, Rawlinson, and Rassam during the 1840-1855 archaeological expeditions. In 1863, Smith married Mary Clifton, and they had six children. His natural talent for cuneiform was first noticed by Samuel Birch. Smith\u0026rsquo;s most significant achievements include deciphering the Epic of Gilgamesh, particularly the flood narrative, significantly advancing the understanding of Assyrian and Babylonian cultures and histories. In March 1876, the British Museum trustees sent him to excavate more of the Library of Ashurbanipal. Tragically, Smith fell ill with dysentery in İkizce, a village near Aleppo, and died there at the age of 36 on 19 August.\n"},{"id":"163","href":"/resources/the-church-of-jesus-latter-day-saints-scriptures/","title":"The Church of Jesus of Latter-Day Saints: Scriptures","description":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Scriptures resource offers a comprehensive collection of religious texts central to the faith, including the Old Testament, New Testament, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and various study aids and proclamations.

The religion\u0026rsquo;s full name, \u0026ldquo;Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ,\u0026rdquo; translates to \u0026ldquo;The Great Faith for the Third Universal Redemption.\u0026rdquo;\nCentral to Caodaism is the belief in a single Supreme Being, often visually represented by an all-seeing eye, symbolizing divine wisdom and omnipresence. The religion also venerates a pantheon of saints that include historical, religious, and mythical figures from various cultures, reflecting its inclusive and universalist philosophy.\nCaodaism teaches the principle of spiritual evolution, where human souls progress through multiple incarnations towards perfection and eventual union with the Supreme Being. The faith places a strong emphasis on moral living, vegetarianism, meditation, and prayer as means to spiritual advancement.\nThe religion\u0026rsquo;s organizational structure resembles that of a government, complete with legislative, executive, and judicial branches, symbolizing the faith\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive approach to managing both spiritual and worldly matters. Caodaist temples, known for their colorful and eclectic architecture, often feature symbols and images that reflect the faith\u0026rsquo;s diverse influences.\nCaodaism\u0026rsquo;s emergence was part of a broader spiritual renaissance in Vietnam during the early 20th century, a period marked by a re-examination of traditional beliefs and the exploration of new religious ideas.

Berlinski, a secular Jew and mathematician, questions the completeness and authority of science in answering profound existential and moral questions.\nBerlinski argues that the science often cited by atheists to debunk religious beliefs actually does not conclusively negate the possibility of a divine existence. He highlights the limitations of scientific theories, especially in fields like quantum mechanics and relativity, in explaining the origins and nature of the universe, and he points out that these theories lack comprehensive empirical verifiability. Berlinski expresses skepticism towards Darwinian evolutionary theory, questioning its ability to fully explain the complexity of life and the emergence of human consciousness.\nMoreover, Berlinski challenges the idea that a secular, rationalist approach can provide a robust foundation for morality. He suggests that objective morality might indeed require a religious underpinning, countering the claim that moral understanding can be achieved purely through rational thought.\nDespite his critiques, Berlinski does not completely dismiss the achievements of Western science. He acknowledges the importance of scientific theories as significant human accomplishments but argues that they fall short in addressing the profound questions traditionally explored by religion.\nControversially, Berlinski\u0026rsquo;s book raises questions about his own religious beliefs. Despite his defense of religious thought, Berlinski himself is not religious, leading to discussions about the sincerity and motivation behind his arguments. His book is seen as a response to the rise of militant atheism and the dismissal of religious belief by prominent thinkers in the scientific community.

He is known for his significant contributions to the Israeli software industry, including founding Sapiens International Corporation and developing Rule-Based Object-Oriented technology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Misinai, a secular Jew, self-educated in historical and anthropological subjects, shifted his focus to researching the common Hebrew roots he believes are shared by world Jewry and the Palestinians, including Arab citizens of Israel. This change in focus came after the failure of the Oslo Accords and the commencement of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000.\nMisinai\u0026rsquo;s theory, detailed in his book \u0026ldquo;Brother shall not lift sword against brother,\u0026rdquo; suggests that the majority of Palestinian people are descendants of ancient Hebrews. He posits that the Hebrew ancestors of Palestinians were rural dwellers who remained in the land of Israel to work and supply Rome with grain and olive oil. His work claims that the Hebrew origin of Palestinians was an openly discussed topic until relatively recent history. He also states that a significant portion of Palestinians underwent forced conversion to Islam during the Fatimid era under Caliph al-Hakim\u0026rsquo;s reign, leading to a significant Arabization of these populations.\nMisinai categorizes Palestinians into three main groups: \u0026ldquo;Descendants of Israel,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Brethren of Israel,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Palestinians of miscellaneous origins.\u0026rdquo; He asserts that the \u0026ldquo;Descendants of Israel\u0026rdquo; are direct descendants of ancient biblical Hebrews from the Kingdom of Judah, whereas the \u0026ldquo;Brethren of Israel\u0026rdquo; include descendants of the brother nations of the Hebrews, like the Edomites, Ammonites, and Moabites. These groups were variously converted to Judaism before the Roman invasion and then to Christianity and Islam. He further claims that nearly 90% of Palestinians living in Israel proper and the occupied territories are of Hebrew descent.\nMisinai\u0026rsquo;s controversial views have led to the development of \u0026ldquo;The Engagement,\u0026rdquo; a project aimed at bringing peace to Israel by promoting the idea of a shared ancestry between Jews and Palestinians.

Discovered on a single fragmentary tablet excavated in Nippur in 1893 and recognized in 1912, it dates back to around 1600 BCE. This myth forms part of a group of Sumerian creation myths found at the same site, including the Barton Cylinder and the Debate between sheep and grain, and the Debate between Winter and Summer.\nThe surviving text of the Eridu Genesis begins with the gods An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursanga creating the Sumerians and establishing comfortable living conditions for animals. It recounts the establishment of kingship and the founding of the first cities, including Eridu, Bad-tibira, Larak, Sippar, and Shuruppak. A key element of the Eridu Genesis is the story of a great flood, a narrative shared with many ancient cultures. In this myth, the gods decide not to save humanity from a catastrophic flood. Ziusudra, the king and priest of Shuruppak, learns about the impending disaster. The Sumerian fragment does not include details of the construction of an ark, as found in the later Akkadian Atra-Hasis Epic, but hints that Enki (the Sumerian equivalent of Akkadian Ea) may have provided similar instructions.\nThe tablet describes a severe storm lasting seven days and nights, during which Ziusudra\u0026rsquo;s boat is tossed on the great waters. After the flood, Ziusudra prostrates himself before the gods An and Enlil, who grant him eternal life for preserving animals and mankind. An interesting aspect of the Eridu Genesis is its post-flood narrative, where Ziusudra is caused to dwell in the land of Dilmun, after his boat floats down the Euphrates river into the Persian Gulf. This contrasts with other flood stories where the ark lands on a mountain or upstream.\nModern scholars speculate that the Sumerian deluge story might reflect localized river flooding in ancient cities like Shuruppak, supported by archaeological evidence of a flood layer dating to around 2900 BCE. Additionally, the figure of Ziusudra appears in the Sumerian Instructions of Shuruppak, dating to about 2600 BCE, indicating his prominence in Sumerian literature by the 3rd millennium BCE​.\nSee also # Wiki › Comparative Mythology Resources › Barton Cylinder Resources › Debate between sheep and grain Resources › Debate between Winter and Summer Resources › The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature External links # ETCSL – Text and translation of the Eridu Genesis Translation and adaptation of Eridu Genesis "},{"id":"170","href":"/resources/the-gospels-in-the-stars/","title":"The Gospel in the Stars","description":"Joseph A.

He has dedicated a significant part of his career to investigating contentious findings and highlighting what he perceives as inconsistencies in the scientific community\u0026rsquo;s understanding of human history, geology, and evolution.\nWhile Zillmer has gained a following and is recognized as a bestselling author in Germany, his work is generally viewed with skepticism by the mainstream scientific community. His theories and conclusions are often considered fringe or pseudo-scientific by many experts in the relevant fields. Despite this, Zillmer continues to contribute to the discourse surrounding these subjects, representing a voice outside of traditional scientific paradigms.\nExternal links # Hans-Joachim Zillmer | Web presence "},{"id":"172","href":"/resources/the-kabbalah-law-and-mysticism-in-the-jewish-tradition-/","title":"The Kabbalah: Law and Mysticism in the Jewish Tradition","description":"\"The Kabbalah: Law and Mysticism in the Jewish Tradition\" (simply \"La Kabbale\" in French, its original title) by Alexandre Safran is a comprehensive exploration of Jewish mysticism and tradition, transcending a purely analytical study of Jewish esotericism.

This synthesis results in a holistic understanding of reality as presented in Kabbalistic teachings.\n\u0026ldquo;La Kabbale\u0026rdquo; represents a significant work of synthesis in an area where mere critical methods are insufficient. It is an essential read for those interested in delving deeply into the intricacies of Kabbalistic thought and the broader spectrum of Jewish mystical tradition​.\nAbout Alexandre Safran # Alexandre Safran was a distinguished Romanian-born rabbi, philosopher, and scholar, deeply rooted in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalistic teachings. Born in 1910 in Bacău, Romania, he became the Chief Rabbi of Romania during a turbulent period for the Jewish community, notably during World War II. A vocal advocate for the rights and protection of Jews during the Holocaust, Safran worked tirelessly to save thousands of lives, often engaging in diplomatic efforts with authorities and the church.\nAfter the war, Safran continued his religious and scholarly pursuits, eventually moving to Geneva, Switzerland, where he served as the Chief Rabbi. His scholarly work is characterized by a deep understanding of Jewish mysticism, philosophy, and the Kabbalah, which he explored and elucidated in his writings, including \u0026ldquo;La Kabbale\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;The Kabbalah\u0026rdquo;). Safran\u0026rsquo;s approach combined rigorous academic study with a profound spiritual insight, making his contributions to Jewish thought and Kabbalistic scholarship both unique and significant.

Gibson, a historical researcher, embarks on a quest to investigate the origins of Islam, challenging the conventional narrative about the birthplace of the religion.\nThe central thesis of Gibson\u0026rsquo;s documentary is the controversial claim that the Islamic holy city of Mecca, as known today, was not the original location mentioned in early Islamic texts. He argues that the descriptions of Mecca in early Islamic scriptures do not align with the geographical and archaeological realities of the current city. Instead, Gibson suggests that the original holy site of Islam was located in Petra, in modern-day Jordan.\nThroughout the documentary, Gibson meticulously examines archaeological evidence, ancient manuscripts, and architectural remnants to support his theory. He points out discrepancies in the directional alignment of early mosques, which, according to his research, face Petra rather than Mecca. This finding is crucial to his argument, as the Qibla, or the direction towards which Muslims pray, is a fundamental aspect of Islamic practice.\nGibson delves into the historical context of the early Islamic period, exploring how the city of Petra, a major trading hub and a cultural melting pot, could have been a more likely setting for the emergence of Islam. He examines the city\u0026rsquo;s religious significance in pre-Islamic times, its architectural wonders like the Al-Khazneh temple, and its strategic location along ancient trade routes.\nThe documentary also explores the possible reasons for the shift of the sacred city from Petra to Mecca, suggesting political, religious, and social factors that might have influenced this change.

The manifesto embraces the idea that technology can create a world of abundance, equity, and harmony with nature. It promotes values such as ingenuity, continuity, and siblinghood and emphasizes the responsible use of technology to create a better world. Cyberparadism is seen as a pathway to a future where technology and nature coexist harmoniously, enhancing rather than detracting from the natural world​​.","content":"The Techno-Optimist Manifesto presents a vision of a future where technology is the driving force behind societal progress and human well-being. It challenges the pervasive narrative that technology causes harm, such as job loss, environmental degradation, and societal ills, arguing instead that technology has been, and should continue to be, a source of human advancement and achievement.\nCentral to the manifesto is the belief that societies, like sharks, must continue to grow or face decline. Growth, according to the manifesto, leads to vitality, expansion of life, increased knowledge, and higher well-being. The Techno-Optimists argue that economic growth is essential, and that stagnation leads to negative outcomes like zero-sum thinking, internal conflict, and societal collapse.\nThe manifesto identifies three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. With the first two facing limitations due to demographic trends and environmental constraints, technology is seen as the primary, sustainable driver of future growth. Techno-Optimists view technology as a lever on the world, allowing for more to be achieved with less, and as the main source of growth throughout history.\nThe Techno-Optimist Manifesto calls for a renewed embrace of technology, urging society to recognize its potential to build a better world. It advocates for a shift in perspective, from pessimism and fear about technological change to optimism and excitement about the possibilities it offers. The manifesto serves as a rallying cry for those who believe in the power of technology to transform society for the better, promoting a vision of a future where technology enhances human capabilities and leads to a more prosperous and equitable world.\nAbout Marc Andreessen # Marc Andreessen is a prominent American entrepreneur, investor, and software engineer, renowned for his influential role in shaping the modern internet landscape.

The Tradition doesn't necessarily refer to a specific set of scriptures or books, but can be understood as the cultural and mythological legacy of all the individual people that had formalized the highest truths in a codified and allegedly incorruptable manner.","content":"In very general terms, tradition refers to a set of beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to another, often over many centuries or even millennia. It encompasses a wide range of cultural expressions, from religious rituals and moral codes to artistic styles and social norms. Traditions are often seen as a way of connecting people with their cultural heritage and preserving their collective identity and history.\nOver the centuries, many different traditions have developed in different parts of the world. For example, some traditions are associated with particular religious beliefs, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, while others are based on cultural practices, such as the traditions of indigenous peoples or the festivals and customs of various ethnic groups.\nHermetic tradition # The Tradition, as referred to by Hermetic philosophy or more specifically Hermeticism, is the notion that a body of knowledge and wisdom has been preserved over millenia which origins date back to ancient Greece and Egypt. It\u0026rsquo;s based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who was said to be the author of a set of scriptures known as the Corpus Hermeticum. The Tradition encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, and is considered by some to be a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge.\nOne of the key components of The Tradition is astrology, which was considered a science in ancient times and played a significant role in the development of astronomy. The astrologers of The Tradition believed that the positions and movements of celestial bodies had a direct influence on human affairs and that the study of the stars could reveal secrets about the universe and the nature of reality.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # Jean Sendy, a French author who wrote on the subject of ancient astronauts, translates Elohim as the \u0026ldquo;gods from the sky\u0026rdquo; or the Celestials. He argues that the term Elohim in the Hebrew Bible refers to a group of beings that were not strictly divine, but rather a class of powerful, advanced beings from the celestial sky who interacted with humanity.\nIn Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, Sendy identifies Medievalism as a key moment where the inherited Tradition flourished:\nMedievalists are called medievalists because their view, inherited from the Tradition of Moses, reached its apogee in the Middle Ages. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, humanists, proud of their fragmentary sciences, jeered at medieval beliefs. Medievalists have always believed in the possibility of transmuting metals, making flying machines, and even going to the moon. They were positively ridiculous in the nineteenth century, when the absurdity of their wild notions was clearly demonstrated. Today, cJf course, peing a medievalist, I feel more at ease than a humanist\u0026hellip;\nLater on in the same book, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s thought gets developed even further:\nMedievalists have always believed in space travel, because they have never doubted the Tradition that claims to be the heritage of the Celestials and promises that men will first conquer the moon, then the universe of the gods their cousins.\nAt the end of Chapter 10 of the same book, Sendy dares to make a prediction that his ideas would either be confirmed or invalidated by future discoveries:\nAbove the smug nineteenth century, our twentieth century is joining the Middle Ages, which were directly connected with the Biblical Tradition. This book is a reading ef that Tradition in the light ef today\u0026rsquo;s scientific knewledge, and it will be either confirmed er invalidated by the knowledge and discoveries of tomerrow.\nEncoded precessional knowledge # One of the main ideas put forward by Jean Sendy in virtually all of his work is the notion that the Zodiacal symbolism is strongly associated with the progression of precession-induced eras or so-called world ages. In his book Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, he explains in a lengthy Chatper 16 how the precession is responsible for a shifting of the night sky and the constellation on the zodiacal plane. At the end of that chatper, he hints that this knowledge has been a core tenet of a millenia-long tradition:\nI have presented four main points in support of my thesis:\nThe priests of ancient Egypt, Judaism and Christianity have all claimed to be the heirs of a Tradition that came \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The persistence with which the Bull-Ram-Fish zodiacal symbolism has been maintained down to the present shows that a single Tradition is involved. The physical transmission of knowledge that came \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo; was attributed by the Egyptian priests to \u0026ldquo;gods,\u0026rdquo; by the Jews to \u0026ldquo;Elohim,\u0026rdquo; by the Christian Tradition to \u0026ldquo;angels.\u0026rdquo; (And the Byzantine theologians maintained that those \u0026ldquo;angels\u0026rdquo; had sexes.) The concrete reality of those gods-Elohim-angels is the most rational explanation of the knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes indicated by the zodiacal symbolism of the three related religions. Of all the versions of the Myth, only the one contained in the Bible has been transmitted to us by a line of priests and theologians from whom, since Moses, changing as much as a single letter of the text has always been an abominable crime.\nA Gentleman\u0026rsquo;s Joyous Esotericism # In a seminal paper of the same title, Stefano Bigliardi fleshes out an accurate portrayal of Jean Sendy. As the notion of an inherited Tradition is a central key aspect of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s thought, in the seminal paper, the Tradition is introduced through the references to Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s book Les cahiers de cours de Moïse (French for Moses\u0026rsquo; course notebooks) as follows:\nSendy’s hypothesis is that Moses was the custodian of an ancestral “Tradition.” The Tradition involves an historical and a prophetic element. The history is that of the arrival on earth of extra-terrestrial cosmonauts, which Sendy calls Theosites (their home planet being Theos, p. 201). The Book of Genesis is, therefore, an account of their arrival and of their manipulation of humans, as well as the Earth’s environment, over a long period of time. Each “day” in Genesis can be understood as a specific phase in the Theosites’ presence on our planet, and each phase corresponds, in turn, to the sun’s different positions at dawn, with reference to the constellations of the horoscope. These positions shift over the millennia (a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, pp. 33-44). The prophetical part of the Tradition, which, likewise, makes reference to the precession, hints at humanity’s spiritual and technological development after the Theosites left our planet.\nBigliardi mentions Sendy\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the Tradition further on:\nConcerning the prophetic part of the Tradition, according to Sendy, humanity has entered the Age of Aquarius, in which its development is comparable to that of the Theosites.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAll those civilizations that were able to conserve the Tradition flourished, according to Sendy, whereas the remaining ones went astray.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTo begin with, Catholicism is seen by Sendy as a repository of Tradition, and hence as a vessel of correct knowledge and orientation for humanity in scientific, as well as ethical, matters. Sendy remarks that the Jesuits were also custodians of the Tradition and they were perfectly aware, therefore, that Columbus would reach America and not the Indies (pp. 300-301).\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his Coming of the Gods, Jean Sendy writes the following about the Tradition and himself being a Medievalist:\nDid the assumption of mediocrity, which von Hoerner reproaches the Greeks for not having formulated and applied, constitute the basis of the thought of the First Civilizations, the thought that bas been transmitted since the dawn of historic times by what is called the Tradition? In other words, did \u0026ldquo;the Ancients\u0026rdquo; think more accurately than \u0026ldquo;the Greeks?\u0026rsquo;· That is exactly what men of the Middle Ages (of whom I am one) have always repeated to Renaissance humanists, reproaching them for their determination to replace the thought of the Ancients with neo-Greek thought.\nSendy explores the idea of the Tradition and questions whether the assumption of mediocrity, which von Hoerner criticized the Greeks for not having, was actually the basis of thought for the First Civilizations. Sendy suggests that the thought of the Ancients, as transmitted through the Tradition, may have been more accurate than the thought of the Greeks. He also notes that men of the Middle Ages, including himself, have traditionally held this view and have criticized Renaissance humanists for replacing ancient thought with neo-Greek thought. That\u0026rsquo;s why he considers himself a Medievalist, because he recognizes the Tradition to be preserving a body of knowledge that was available to the Ancients. This body of knowledge assumes to know who these Gods of Old were. These Gods that came from the Skies and where made of blood and flesh just like us.\nSee also # Wiki › Bible Wiki › The Truth Wiki › Kabbalah External links # Perennial philosophy | Wikipedia Tradition | Wikipedia "},{"id":"183","href":"/wiki/the-truth/","title":"The Truth","description":"The Truth, the speculative notion that when enough tokens of partial truths are suitably demystified and compiled together, a cohesive all-encompassing narrative emerges that tells the chronicles of how life on Earth was engineered by an extraterrestrial civilization and of what followed thereafter up to this very day where this Truth will be revealed and retold during the times of the Apocalypse.","content":"From a philosophical perspective, Truth can be understood as the state or quality of being in accordance with fact or reality. It is an objective reality that exists independently of human opinion or belief, and it can be discovered through reason, empirical observation, and critical thinking. While truth can be difficult to discern, it is often associated with certain qualities or hallmarks, such as coherence, consistency, accuracy, and transparency. These qualities help to distinguish truth from falsehood, and they provide a standard by which truth claims can be evaluated.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # Wheel of Heaven take the account of the Räelian revelations as canonical. The foundational texts of the Räelian new religious movement, namely \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells the Truth,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Let’s Welcome The Extraterrestrials,\u0026rdquo; present a groundbreaking perspective on the origins of life on Earth. Contrary to conventional beliefs, these works posit that life here is not a result of random evolution but a deliberate act of creation. However, this act wasn\u0026rsquo;t divine but scientific, orchestrated by extraterrestrial beings, the Elohim, who possess an advanced grasp of genetics and cellular biology.\nThese texts detail how the Elohim, from a distant planet, mastered the intricacies of life through DNA manipulation. Seeking a conducive environment for their experiments, they identified Earth. Here, they crafted plants, animals, and eventually humans. This narrative challenges traditional interpretations of the Bible, suggesting that the term \u0026ldquo;Elohim\u0026rdquo; (translated as \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; in many versions) actually refers to these extraterrestrial creators, emphasizing its plural form in Hebrew, meaning \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Elohim\u0026rsquo;s experiments weren\u0026rsquo;t without challenges. Disturbed by the aggressive tendencies of humans, they expelled them from their initial habitat, reminiscent of the biblical \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden.\u0026rdquo; Subsequent interactions between the Elohim and humans led to hybrid offspring, as alluded to in the Bible.\nA significant event was the Great Flood, which, as per these texts, was a catastrophic attempt by a faction of the Elohim to obliterate life on Earth. However, a benevolent group among the Elohim preserved select humans and animals, drawing parallels to the Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark narrative.\nPost this cataclysm, the Elohim made a profound discovery: they too were products of a similar scientific experiment from another planet. Opting for non-interference thereafter, they still sent emissaries like Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad to guide humanity, embedding clues about our origins in religious scriptures.\nThe present era, termed the age of the Apocalypse (meaning \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; in Greek), is significant. It\u0026rsquo;s a time when prophecies align with advancements, like the re-establishment of Israel, technological breakthroughs restoring sight, instant global communication, and the synthesis of the first human gene.\nRaël\u0026rsquo;s account in the second book offers a deeper dive into the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s world. He describes a journey to their planet, encounters with historical prophets, and insights into life and death on the \u0026ldquo;planet of the Eternals.\u0026rdquo; Here, individuals live for centuries, and upon death, are recreated from their genetic code. Rael\u0026rsquo;s experiences also shed light on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the universe\u0026rsquo;s infinite nature, challenging conventional notions of divinity and the afterlife.\nOur take # In very simple terms, to summarize The Truth as understood from the lenses of Raëlism is that life on Earth was created by a group of scientists from a distant planet who had achieved a level of technical and scientific knowledge comparable to that which humans will soon reach. The scientists created artificial life, including primitive animals and plants, and eventually, land animals and humans, who were kept in ignorance of scientific knowledge to prevent them from becoming a danger to their creators\u0026rsquo; home planet. The passage suggests that the story of the creation of the Earth as described in the Book of Genesis has been distorted and misunderstood over time, and that it contains traces of the truth about the origins of life on Earth.\nSuch a claim would challenge traditional views of the origins of life on Earth, and raises many questions about the nature of reality and the role of science and technology in shaping our world.\nSee also # Wiki › Bible Wiki › Genesis Wiki › Raëlism Wiki › The Tradition Wiki › Neo-Euhemerism Read more # Resources › The Book Which Tells The Truth "},{"id":"184","href":"/resources/the-zohar-pritzker/","title":"The Zohar: Pritzker Edition","description":"\"The Zohar: Pritzker Edition\" by Daniel Matt is a monumental translation of the Zohar, the foundational work of Jewish mysticism.

According to some interpretations of the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Jewish texts, the Third Temple will replace the Second Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The rebuilding of the Third Temple is seen as a significant event in the Messianic age and is eagerly awaited by some Jews. There is currently no Third Temple in existence, and the exact nature and purpose of the Third Temple remains a matter of debate and speculation among scholars and religious leaders.\nThe rebuilding of the Third Temple remains a topic of religious and political discussion, but there has been no serious effort to begin construction. The Temple Mount, the site where the First and Second Temples were located, is currently occupied by the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, and the political and religious issues surrounding the site make it unlikely that a Third Temple will be built in the near future. Some ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups advocate for the rebuilding of the Third Temple, but their views are not representative of the wider Jewish community and face opposition from other religious and political groups.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In Raëlism, the Third Temple temple is equated with a dedicated residence to the Elohim which would also act as an embassy.\nAccording to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter \u0026ldquo;The New Commandments\u0026rdquo;, Section \u0026ldquo;Your Mission\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh asks Raël and his followers to built a residence that serves as an embassy between the People of the Earth and the Elohim:\nHave a residence built in a pleasant country with a mild climate, with seven rooms always ready to receive guests, each with a separate bathroom, a conference room able to accommodate twenty-one people, a swimming pool and a dining room capable of seating twenty-one people.\nThis residence should be constructed in the middle of a park and should be protected from curious onlookers. The park should be entirely surrounded by walls to prevent anyone from seeing the residence and the swimming pool.\nThe residence should be situated at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the walls around the park. It will have a maximum of two stories and should be further screened from view by an inner barrier of trees and bushes. Install two entrances in the surrounding wall, one to the south and another on the northern side.\nThe residence will also have two entrances. There will be a terrace on the roof where a spacecraft of twelve meters in diameter may land. Access from that terrace to the interior is essential.\nThe air space above and around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance.\nYou will try to ensure that the area where this residence is built -if possible larger than stipulated here- is treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located, by virtue of it being our embassy on Earth.\nThe passage outlines instructions for the construction of a residence in a pleasant country with a mild climate, to be used as an embassy on Earth for extraterrestrial beings. The residence should have seven rooms with separate bathrooms, a conference room for 21 people, a swimming pool, and a dining room for 21 people. It should be situated in the middle of a park surrounded by walls, at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the park walls. The residence will have two entrances and will be screened by trees and bushes. The air space around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance. The area around the residence should be treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located.\nIn Raëlian beliefs, the third temple refers to the embassy that the Elohim, the extraterrestrial creators, asked to be built on Earth in accordance with their plan. They believe that the embassy is the symbol of the third temple, which is a place of worship for those who believe in the message of the Elohim.\nAccording to their beliefs, the first temple was built by King Solomon in Jerusalem and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, while the second temple was rebuilt after the Babylonian exile and destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. They see the construction of the embassy as the fulfillment of the prophecy in the Bible that the third temple will be built by the Messiah.\nThe embassy is seen as the place where the Elohim will meet with their ambassadors and provide them with guidance and knowledge. The Raëlians see the embassy as a place of peace and education, where the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s message of love, peace, and respect for life can be shared with the world.\nIn this sense, the embassy can be considered the third temple, as it represents the physical manifestation of the Raëlian belief system and their connection to the Elohim. It is a place where their members can come together to worship and learn, and where they can share their beliefs with others in the hopes of promoting a more peaceful and harmonious world.\nThe Raëlian Embassy # The Raëlian Embassy is a proposed building that is part of the main tenets of the Raëlian movement. The Raëlian movement is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as Elohim created life on Earth, and that they will return in the future to guide humanity to a new era of peace and harmony. The Raëlian Embassy is intended to be a physical representation of the movement\u0026rsquo;s beliefs and values, serving as a hub for the promotion of Raëlian ideas and a place for members to gather and worship. The construction of the Raëlian Embassy has not yet begun, and it is unclear when or if it will be built.\nSee also # Wiki › Abraham Wiki › List of prophets and religions External links # Prophet | Wikipedia Prophecy | Britannica Prophecy | Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy "},{"id":"186","href":"/resources/those-gods-who-made-heaven-and-earth/","title":"Those Gods Who Made Heaven and Earth: The Evidence for Alien Visitors to Earth before the Dawn of History","description":"\"Those Gods Who Made Heaven and Earth: The Evidence for Alien Visitors to Earth before the Dawn of History\" by Jean Sendy is a book that explores the possibility of extraterrestrial influence on ancient human civilizations.

The purpose of the spacecraft was to improve the diplomatic relations with the Elohimian home planet who were hostile to the preservation of life on Earth by securing amensty for its inhabitants.","content":"The Tower of Babel is a story from the book of Genesis in the Bible that tells of the building of a tower by the descendants of Noah to reach heaven. According to the story, the people of the world were once united and spoke a single language, but after the tower was built, God confused their language and scattered them across the earth.\nThe story of the Tower of Babel is often interpreted as a symbol of human pride and ambition, and as a warning against trying to reach for things that are beyond our understanding and control. It is also seen as an explanation for the diversity of languages and cultures in the world.\nIn addition to its religious significance, the Tower of Babel has also played a role in literature, art, and popular culture throughout history. The image of the tower has been used to symbolize various forms of human endeavor and ambition, and has been referenced and portrayed in a wide range of cultural contexts.\nAccording to Paul Anthony Wallis # Paul Anthony Wallis, an Australian author on the subject of re-interpreting the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, he explains in his first book on the topic, called Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis Teach That the Human Race Was Created by God or Engineered by ETs, how he Sumerian account of Ziusudra related to the Biblical creation of the Tower of Babel:\nIn Babylon the Sky People engineer an incredible structure. A grand opening celebration is held and a Council of Fifty is set aside to govern operations. From within the new structure seven technical experts dispatch the three hundred observers to their stations in the sky.\nThis is a particularly intriguing detail because in the parallel Biblical account the name of the structure, “Babel” translates as “gateway for the elohim” – if el is short for elohim. Genesis 11 specifies that Babel has been constructed as a means of reaching the heavens. So here the cuneiform and Biblical accounts serve to amplify and finesse each other. Today we would call the stations in the sky “space stations” and the sending structure a “stargate”.\nThis is an intriguing detail because in the parallel biblical account, the name of the structure, \u0026ldquo;Babel,\u0026rdquo; translates to \u0026ldquo;gateway for the elohim,\u0026rdquo; which suggests a connection between the two stories. Wallis suggests that this could be seen as a primitive account of space travel and that these \u0026ldquo;stations in the sky\u0026rdquo; could be thought of as modern-day space stations, and the sending structure as a \u0026ldquo;stargate.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, where Yahweh explicitly mentions the Tower of Babel and says the following about its specific purpose:\nBut the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators.

So they built an enormous rocket — The Tower of Babel.\nAnd now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n— Genesis 11: 6.\nIn this passage, it is suggested that the people of Israel were highly intelligent and progressed quickly with the help of exiled creators. They built a massive rocket, known as the Tower of Babel, with the aim of going to the creators’ planet to show their intelligence, gratitude, and peacefulness in order to obtain their pardon.

More specifically to lengthen human life expectancy up to 1'000 years as it was the case during the Age of Leo.","content":"The Tree of Life is a concept that appears in many cultures and religious traditions, and is often associated with various symbolic and spiritual meanings.\nIn the Bible, the Tree of Life is mentioned in the book of Genesis, where it is described as a tree that grew in the Garden of Eden and provided immortality to those who ate from its fruit. After Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge and were expelled from the Garden, they were prevented from eating from the Tree of Life, thus becoming mortal.\nIn many cultures and spiritual traditions, the Tree of Life is seen as a symbol of the interconnectedness of all things and a representation of the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. It is often seen as a symbol of the connection between the physical and spiritual realms, and as a representation of the divine power that sustains all of creation.\nIn some traditions, the Tree of Life is also associated with the idea of a universal hierarchy of beings, with roots that reach into the underworld, a trunk that represents the physical world, and branches that reach into the heavens.\nThe Tree of Life continues to hold great symbolic significance, and is often referenced and depicted in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture. Its image is used to evoke feelings of life, growth, and the interconnectedness of all things, and it continues to be an important part of spiritual and cultural traditions around the world.\nEtymology # The English word \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *drew-, which means \u0026ldquo;wood\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tree.\u0026rdquo; This root gave rise to many words across the Indo-European languages, including the Greek word \u0026ldquo;dendron\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo;) and the Latin word \u0026ldquo;drus\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;oak\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the context of the Bible, the phrase \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; is often interpreted as a metaphor for eternal life or a divine source of life. However, it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to interpret the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; as a metaphor for a source of knowledge or wisdom, similar to a book or records of knowledge.\nInterestingly, the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;sefer,\u0026rdquo; which comes from the same root as the word \u0026ldquo;sippur,\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tale.\u0026rdquo; Both \u0026ldquo;sefer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sippur\u0026rdquo; ultimately come from the Proto-Semitic root *spr, which means \u0026ldquo;to write\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to inscribe.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the Bible, the idea of wisdom and knowledge being written down is also present. For example, the book of Proverbs is a collection of wise sayings attributed to King Solomon, and the book of Deuteronomy contains a written record of the laws and commandments given to the Israelites by God.\nSo while the words for \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; have different roots, the metaphorical interpretation of the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; as a source of eternal life or divine knowledge is similar to the way we might think of a book or records of knowledge. Additionally, the fact that the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; and the root of the word for \u0026ldquo;writing\u0026rdquo; share a common ancestor suggests a deeper linguistic connection between these concepts.\nThe Sumerian writing system included a type of character known as a \u0026ldquo;sumerogram,\u0026rdquo; which represented a word or concept rather than a specific sound. One such sumerogram was 𒊬 (kiri), which meant \u0026ldquo;orchard\u0026rdquo; in Sumerian. This symbol was later adopted into the Akkadian language, where it was pronounced as \u0026ldquo;šiṭrum\u0026rdquo; and could also refer to a \u0026ldquo;place where writings are stored.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a book being derived from a tree is not unique to East Asian languages. In English, for example, we still use the word \u0026ldquo;leaf\u0026rdquo; to refer to the pages of a book, and the term \u0026ldquo;codex\u0026rdquo; (meaning a bound book) is derived from the Latin word for a wooden block or tablet.\nThe English word \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic word bokiz, which meant \u0026ldquo;beech tree.\u0026rdquo; This is because the early Germanic peoples used the soft bark of the beech tree to write on.1 Over time, the meaning of the word *bokiz shifted from \u0026ldquo;beech tree\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;book,\u0026rdquo; likely because beech bark was a common material used for writing and inscribing information.\nSimilarly, the German word \u0026ldquo;Buch\u0026rdquo; can be traced back to the Old High German word \u0026ldquo;buoh\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;buoch,\u0026rdquo; which also meant \u0026ldquo;beech tree.\u0026rdquo; Just like in English, the bark of the beech tree was used for writing on in Old High German. Over time, the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;buoh\u0026rdquo; shifted from \u0026ldquo;beech tree\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;book.\u0026rdquo;\nThe link between the beech tree and the concept of a book may seem unusual at first, but it makes sense when you consider the historical context. In the days before paper was widely available, people used a variety of materials for writing, including parchment, papyrus, and even tree bark. The soft bark of the beech tree was an especially good material for writing, as it was thin, flexible, and durable.\nThe metaphors of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Bible can be interpreted as representing a record of knowledge or wisdom kept alive through a tree that is analogous to a book or writing onto wood/paper.\nThe metaphorical interpretation of these trees as sources of knowledge or wisdom is supported by the fact that the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; in the phrase \u0026ldquo;Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;da\u0026rsquo;at,\u0026rdquo; which can also be translated as \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;understanding.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, the idea of wisdom and knowledge being recorded and preserved in written form is present in many cultures, including the use of tree bark for writing material in ancient times.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter Truth, The Flood, Yahweh says the following about the Tree of Life:\nLet us move on to the fourth chapter of Genesis.\nAnd in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.\n— Genesis 4: 3-4.\nThe creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn Genesis 4, Cain and Abel offered gifts to the Elohim. Meanwhile, the creators who were exiled and under surveillance instructed the humans to provide them with food to show their loyalty. This led to the leaders of the first humans being granted access to the Tree of Life, allowing them to live for a very long time as detailed in Genesis 5.\nYahweh goes on and describes in more clarity what the implications of the Tree of Life are:\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n— Genesis 6: 1-2.\nThe creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.\nMy spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n— Genesis 6: 3.\nLongevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind\u0026rsquo;s progress was slowed down.\nIn Genesis 6, the exiled Elohim called the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo; in the Bible took the most beautiful daughters of humanity as their wives. The creators in exile had been granted permission to benefit from the Tree of Life, but this benefit did not extend to their offspring. As a result, the secret of eternal life was lost, and human progress slowed down.\nIn the last Chapter of the same book, The Elohim, Yahweh makes another reference to the Tree of Life being a biomedical technology of longevity:\nFor us, the problem is very different. We are not eternal, but we are able to live ten times longer than you, thanks to a small surgical adjustment, which in effect is the biblical \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Elohim, much like humans, are not immortal, but they are able to live ten times longer than humans due to a surgical procedure that is equivalent to the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; in the Bible.\nThe Tree of Life is a biomedical technology or surgical adjustment that allows for longevity of life. It was granted to the leaders of the first humans by the creators in exile, allowing them to live for many years. However, the benefit of the Tree of Life did not extend to the offspring of these leaders, resulting in the loss of the secret of eternal life and the slowing down of human progress.\nOur take # Speculating on the possible nature of the Tree of Life technology based on our current understanding of biomedicine, it could involve genetic engineering or gene therapy to modify the DNA of the recipient, targeting genes that affect aging and lifespan. Another possibility could be the use of regenerative medicine, stem cell therapy, or organ replacement technology to repair or replace damaged tissues and organs in the body, thereby restoring health and extending lifespan. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the Tree of Life technology involves the manipulation of the microbiome, which is known to play a critical role in maintaining health and longevity. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these are purely speculative ideas, and the actual technology, if it exists, may be vastly different from what we can currently imagine.\nSee also # Wiki › Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil External links # Tree of life | Wikipedia Birch bark manuscripts are documents written on pieces of the inner layer of birch bark, which was commonly used for writing before the mass production of paper.

According to the biblical story, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was a tree in the Garden of Eden that God commanded Adam and Eve not to eat from. However, the serpent tempted Eve to eat from the tree, and she in turn convinced Adam to do the same. This act of disobedience is seen as the first sin, and is believed to have caused humanity to fall from a state of innocence and purity into a state of sin and mortality.\nThe Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is often interpreted as a symbol of the human desire for knowledge and understanding, and as a representation of the consequences of disobedience and sin. It is also seen as a symbol of the duality of human nature, with good and evil coexisting within each individual.\nIn addition to its religious significance, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil has also played a role in literature, art, and popular culture throughout history. The image of the tree is often used to symbolize the acquisition of knowledge and the potential consequences of its use, and has been referenced and portrayed in a wide range of cultural contexts.\nIn Genesis # In the Genesis 2-3, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is one of two types of Trees being mentioned.\nGenesis 2, 9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\nEtymology # The English word \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *drew-, which means \u0026ldquo;wood\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tree.\u0026rdquo; This root gave rise to many words across the Indo-European languages, including the Greek word \u0026ldquo;dendron\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo;) and the Latin word \u0026ldquo;drus\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;oak\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the context of the Bible, the phrase \u0026ldquo;tree of knowledge\u0026rdquo; is often interpreted as a metaphor for a source of knowledge or wisdom, similar to a book or records of knowledge. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; in this phrase is \u0026ldquo;da\u0026rsquo;at,\u0026rdquo; which can also be translated as \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;understanding.\u0026rdquo;\nInterestingly, the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;sefer,\u0026rdquo; which comes from the same root as the word \u0026ldquo;sippur,\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tale.\u0026rdquo; Both \u0026ldquo;sefer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sippur\u0026rdquo; ultimately come from the Proto-Semitic root *spr, which means \u0026ldquo;to write\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to inscribe.\u0026rdquo;\nSo while the words for \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; have different roots, the metaphorical interpretation of the \u0026ldquo;tree of knowledge\u0026rdquo; as a source of knowledge or wisdom is similar to the way we might think of a book or records of knowledge.

So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators.

They were kept ignorant of great scientific secrets, but were educated to measure their intelligence. The prohibition against eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil meant that the created beings could learn and read whatever they wanted, but they were not allowed to access scientific knowledge or they would face death.

Originally proposed by the Trump administration, the Space Force is a distinct and independent military service under the Department of the Air Force, alongside the U.S. Air Force. This article explores the origins, development, and strategic importance of the USSF, highlighting how President Trump perceived the necessity of military capabilities in space.\nHistory # The idea of a separate military branch dedicated to space isn\u0026rsquo;t new or unique to the Trump administration. In fact, similar concepts have been discussed and deliberated upon within the United States government for several decades. These discussions, however, gained significant traction during Trump\u0026rsquo;s presidency, culminating in the establishment of the USSF.\nThe idea was first publicly announced by President Donald Trump during a speech to service members at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in March 2018. In his address, Trump emphasized the strategic importance of space, referring to it as a \u0026ldquo;war-fighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea.\u0026rdquo;\nFollowing this, in June 2018, Trump directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to initiate the process of establishing the Space Force as a separate branch of the military. After a series of negotiations and legislative actions, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 was signed into law on December 20, 2019, formally establishing the USSF.\nTrump\u0026rsquo;s perception of space military necessity # President Trump\u0026rsquo;s push for a separate military branch dedicated to space can be attributed to several factors. One of the most significant of these is the evolving nature of warfare and global security. The strategic importance of space has been steadily increasing over the years, and as of the early 21st century, it is deemed critical for a nation\u0026rsquo;s defense infrastructure.\nThe reasons behind this shift are multifaceted. Firstly, modern military systems heavily rely on space-based assets for functions such as communications, reconnaissance, navigation, and timing. Disrupting an adversary\u0026rsquo;s access to these capabilities could significantly impact their operational effectiveness. Secondly, technological advancements have resulted in an increase in the types of threats that can be posed in or from space, including kinetic physical, non-kinetic physical, electronic, and cyber threats.\nIn addition, there has been a growing international competition in space. Several nations, including Russia and China, have been actively developing and demonstrating capabilities to deny or degrade space-based assets, further escalating the potential for conflicts in space.\nIn this context, the Trump administration saw the creation of the USSF as a strategic necessity. By creating a separate branch with a distinct culture and dedicated resources, the administration aimed to ensure that the United States can effectively deter threats and, if necessary, defend against them.\nSee also # Wiki › Military cover-up of exobiology Wiki › Ufology External links # United States Space Force | Wikipedia Space Force "},{"id":"193","href":"/wiki/wheel-of-heaven/","title":"Wheel of Heaven","description":"Wheel of Heaven, a web knowledge base exploring the working hypothesis that life on Earth was intelligently designed and engineered by the extraterrestrial civilization we collectively remember as the Elohim.

It is also a slightly more obscure reference to Akhenaton, an Egyptian pharao of old who described a disk shaped space ship as looking like a wheel in heaven.","content":"Working hypothesis # A working hypothesis is a specific type of hypothesis, namely one that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails. In this way, a working hypothesis is an accepted starting point for further research. A hypothesis in turn is simply put a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.\nThe working hypothesis that is being considered here is that the integrality of life on planet Earth present and past has been genetically engineered by a highly advanced, highly sophisticated humanoid civilization of interstellar travellers. This extraterrestrial civilization we collectively remember as the Celestials arrived on Earth some 25'000 years ago, subsequently terraformed the shallow oceans into barren land masses and started genetically engineering new life forms ex nihilo, ultimately leading to the creation of a new humanoid species in their own image. What followed this genesis of what is essentially the creation of mankind has been preserved in several religious and esoteric traditions culminating in the preservation and propagation of the Biblical scriptures throughout the world commemorating the origins of life on Earth. Besides religious scriptures, a wide body of remnants in folklore, archeology, paleontology and geology bear witness to this testimony.\nThroughout human history, various people have been contacted directly or indirectly to act as ambassadors and messengers on behalf of the Celestials to guide progress of humanity on one hand and to safeguard the memory of whom created life on Earth on the other hand. The ultimate goal is to determine whether or not humanity can independently overcome self-destruction once reaching the scientific and technological capababilities which serves as an evulation if humanity deserves to inherit the technological legacy of the Celestials, hence taking over the torch as the next chain link of this interstellar species.\nWeb knowledge base # A knowledge base is a self-serve online library of information about a given topic.

Everyone is invited to contribute to the Wheel of Heaven project to provide an even better user and developer experience.\nMeaning of Wheel of Heaven # Wheel of Heaven is a direct reference to the precessional cycle of 25'920 years. Similarly to the days and years, two cycles that account for two distinct scales of time, the precession is a cycle that accounts for a much longer scale of time than days or years, expressly thousand of years. It is only natural to use units of time based on the precessional cycle to typify world ages. Precession based world ages have been used in the past to position oneself on a larger scale of time. The Biblical Book of Genesis uses precessional days to account for the consecutive steps of its creation narrative, the so-called seven days of creation, which stand for more than half a precessional cycle, namely around 13'000 years.\nThe units of the precessional cycle are called Great Months and we name each of these Great Months after the Zodiacal sign under which the sun is rising on the vernal equinox. Since 1950, while the sun is still rising in the sign of Pisces on the vernal equinox, we have entered the Age of Aquarius as the Great Month of the Age of Pisces lasted for 2'160 years and finished in 1950. That\u0026rsquo;s why many say that we live in a new age, the Aquarian age. The Wheel of Heaven therefore points to the importance of precessional world ages and that it cannot be mere coincidence that world transforming events happened at the very passing from one world age to the next one.\nThe Wheel of Heaven, besides being a direct reference to an astronimical cycle that can be perceived in the heavens above us, as it happens, is also a more obscure reference to spherical spacecrafts, allegedly belonging to the Celestials describted at the outset. Such a spacecraft may have been observed by the infamous Egyptian pharao Akhenaton. He described a fiery spaceship in the shape of a flat disk that appeared to him and asked him to build a new capital city which he shall name Armana. The Egyptians recorded the object that Akhenaton had seen and simply named it the Wheel of Heaven.\nSee also # Wiki › Neo-Euhemerism Wiki › Raëlism Read more # Intro › Wheel of Heaven External links # Wheel of Heaven | Github "},{"id":"194","href":"/resources/wonders-in-the-sky/","title":"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times","description":"\"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times\" by Jacques Vallée and Chris Aubeck is a comprehensive investigation into the history of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Wheel of Heaven considers the current World Age to be the Age of Aquarius which started at around the year 1950 of the Common Era.\nIn addition to its astrological significance, the precessional World Age has also been of interest to scholars and scientists who study the history of astronomy and the movements of the Earth and the stars. By studying the effects of precession on the sky, scientists have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the motion of the Earth and the position of the stars, and to reconstruct the history of the sky over thousands of years.\nOverview # The following table shows the last precessional cycle starting with the Age of Aquarius (today) going back 25'920 years.\nBegins in Ends in Zodiacal house Events 1'950 4'110 Age of Aquarius Revelation, Golden Age 210 BC 1'950 Age of Pisces Jesus, multiplication 2'370 BC 210 BC Age of Aries Abraham, Exodus 4'530 BC 2'370 BC Age of Taurus Babel, Sodom \u0026amp; Gomorrah 6'690 BC 4'530 BC Age of Gemini Flood, Noah 8'850 BC 6'690 BC Age of Cancer Garden of Eden, Adam \u0026amp; Eve 11'010 BC 8'850 BC Age of Leo First humans along Elohim 13'170 BC 11'010 BC Age of Virgo Diversity of life 15'330 BC 13'170 BC Age of Libra Astronomy, accomodation 17'490 BC 15'330 BC Age of Scorpio Terraforming and plant life 19'650 BC 17'490 BC Age of Sagittarius Study and analysis 21'810 BC 19'650 BC Age of Capricorn Earth discovered, exploration \u0026hellip; BC 21'810 BC Age of Aquarius Earth barren and void The table of World Ages suggests that human history can be divided into a series of distinct time periods, eras or Ages, each associated with a particular zodiacal house and a range of significant events.

The Age of Pisces, which preceded the present age, lasted from 210 BC to 1950 AD and was marked by significant events such as the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and his fishermen, as well as the demographic multiplication of the human species. The table also suggests a link between the astrological ages and the history of the Elohim or extraterrestrial creators, with the Age of Leo marked by the first humans along with the Elohim.\nWorld Ages # –21'810 –19'650 –17'490 –15'330 –13'170 –11'010 –8'850 –6'690 –4'530 –2'370 –210 1950 See also # Wiki › Chronology Wiki › Great Month Wiki › Great Year Wiki › Precession External links # Astrological age | Wikipedia "},{"id":"196","href":"/wiki/yahweh/","title":"Yahweh","description":"Yahweh (יהוה), also known as the First and the Last (Alpha and Omega) is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the lead representative of the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) as a whole. He is an Eternal in the sense that he has already inhabited multiple bodies (a Elohimian technique to live forever) and therefore member of the Council of Eternals acting as their head of Council. In Biblical scriptures, Yahweh is identifed as the Godhead and is also interchangeably equated with the civilization he's representing, the Elohim. Yahweh was also the Eloha that Raël met on multiple occassions, as did all the prophets that came before him.","content":"Yahweh is the English transliteration of the tetragrammaton YHWH, a four-letter Hebrew name of the Biblical Godhead that is considered too sacred to be pronounced. Yahweh is considered the personal name of God in Judaism and is the name used most often in the Hebrew Bible. In English, it is often written as \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Jehovah.\u0026rdquo;1\nEtymology # The name Yahweh, represented in Hebrew as יהוה (YHWH)2, is known as the Tetragrammaton and is one of the names used for God in the Hebrew Bible. Its exact meaning and origin are somewhat uncertain due to ancient Jewish practices of avoiding the pronunciation of the name out of reverence, substituting it instead with \u0026ldquo;Adonai\u0026rdquo; (Lord) or \u0026ldquo;HaShem\u0026rdquo; (The Name).\nThe most common interpretation of Yahweh is that it derives from the Hebrew verb הוה (hawah), which means \u0026ldquo;to be\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to become\u0026rdquo;. According to this interpretation, Yahweh could be understood as meaning \u0026ldquo;He Who Is\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He Who Exists\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;He Who Will Be\u0026rdquo;. This interpretation is supported by God\u0026rsquo;s statement to Moses in Exodus 3:14: \u0026ldquo;I am who I am\u0026rdquo;, or in Hebrew, \u0026ldquo;אהיה אשר אהיה\u0026rdquo; (Ehyeh asher ehyeh). \u0026ldquo;Ehyeh\u0026rdquo; (אהיה) is the first person singular imperfect form of the verb \u0026ldquo;to be\u0026rdquo; (היה).3 When shifted to the third person form, \u0026ldquo;He Is\u0026rdquo;, the verb could be pronounced as Yahweh, thus lending to the interpretation of Yahweh as \u0026ldquo;He Who Is\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;He Who Exists\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, there are other interpretations and much scholarly debate about the origins and meaning of YHWH, partly due to the lack of vowels in the original Hebrew script and the ancient practice of not pronouncing the name. Some scholars have suggested that the name might be related to a title for a storm god or might have been originally associated with a specific location or shrine.\nIn Raëlism 🔯 # In Raëlism, Yahweh is explicitely identified as the president of the Council of the Eternals governing the Elohim’s planet and therefore an individual of flesh and blood among the Elohimian civilization.\nAccording to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter Meeting the Ancient Prophets, Yahweh himself explains that the Council of the Eternals live in a planet dedicated for that purpose:\nIn my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.\nAmong those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.\nThere are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.\nAlongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals.4\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe passage states that there is a residence on another planet where people from Earth can live due to a scientific secret of eternity based on a single cell. The residence is a large planet where the Council of the Eternals lives, and Yahweh is the president of that council. Currently, there are 8'400 people from Earth living there who have reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite or have contributed to humanity\u0026rsquo;s progress through their discoveries, writings, ways of organizing society, and acts of fraternity, love, or selflessness. Alongside these people, there are 700 members of the Elohim who are part of the Council of the Eternals.\nYahweh, the Eternal # In the first book The Book Which Tells The Truth📖, Raël gets to ask Yahweh a few questions about him and the Elohim in general:\n\u0026lsquo;How old are the oldest ones?\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;The oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;Then your knowledge must be immeasurable?\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;Yes, I have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge, and I will not be able to gain much more. [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rsquo;5\nThe experiment Yahweh is referring to was explained a little earlier on in the same chapter:\n\u0026lsquo;Our body lives on average, ten times longer than yours,\u0026rsquo; he replied.\n\u0026lsquo;Like the first people of the Bible, that is between 750 and 1,200 years. But our mind, our true self, can be truly immortal. I have already explained to you that, starting with any cell of the body, we can re-create the whole person with new living matter. When we are in full possession of our faculties and our brain is at its maximum level of efficiency and knowledge, we surgically remove a tiny sample 108 of the body, which we then preserve. Then, when we really die, we take a cell from this preserved sample and re-create the body in full, just as it had been at the time the sample was taken.\nI say, \u0026ldquo;as it had been at that time\u0026rdquo;, meaning with all its scientific knowledge and, of course, its personality. But in this case, the body is made up of new elements with the potential for another one thousand years of life - and so on eternally. But in order to limit the growth of the population, only geniuses have the right to eternity.\nEverybody on our planet has a cell sample taken at a certain age, hoping that they will be chosen for re-creation after their death. In fact they not only hope for it, they try to earn this resurrection during their life. Once they have died, a grand council of the eternals assembles to decide in a \u0026ldquo;last judgement\u0026rdquo;, who among those who died during the year deserves to live another life. For a period of three lifetimes, the eternal is on probation, and at the end of this time, the council of the eternals reconvenes to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member.\nFrom the moment that one wishes to have a new life, one no longer has the right to have children, although this does not of course prevent love. This explains why the scientists who were members of the council of the eternals wished to create life on other planets. They transferred their procreative instincts onto other planets.\u0026rsquo;6\nYahweh, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old and has lived in twenty-five bodies. He directed the creation of life on Earth and has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge. The Elohim have a technology that allows them to re-create a person\u0026rsquo;s body with new living matter using a tiny sample taken from the body. This technology can create a new body with the potential for another one thousand years of life, and the population is limited by granting eternal life only to geniuses. The council of the eternals decides who among those who have died deserves to live another life, and a grand council of the eternals assembles to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member. Those who wish to have a new life no longer have the right to have children. The scientists who were members of the council of the eternals created life on other planets as a way to transfer their procreative instincts.\nAlpha and Omega # In another passage of the Book, Yahweh explains what was meant by the common saying \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo;:\nJohn, panic-stricken, fell with his face to the ground:\nAnd when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, ‘Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter. 17\nRevelation 1: 17-20\nWe asked John to get up, and we told him that he must write everything that he had seen, and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings when the time would come. We told him that we were “the first and the last”, that is to say, the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies to permit them to do so. We explained to him that the one who was speaking had known death, but had been re-created, thanks to the process explained in the first message, which permits us to live eternally through many bodies.7\nYahweh explains the meaning of the common saying \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo; from the Bible\u0026rsquo;s Book of Revelation. Yahweh told John, who was panic-stricken and fell to the ground, to write everything that he had seen and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings in the future. Yahweh claimed to be \u0026ldquo;the first and the last,\u0026rdquo; the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies that permit them to do so. Yahweh explained that the one who was speaking had known death but had been re-created through the process explained in the first message, which allows them to live eternally through many bodies.\nOn another account, Yahweh says the following:\nI, Yahweh, the alpha and the omega, he who was the first one on Earth and also he who will be the last, I am sending this message to all humans of the Earth through the words of my prophet, Raël, to all those humans whom we have created, and whom we have tried to lead towards the Golden Age, and who we love as if they were our own children.8\nIn this passage, Yahweh describes himself as the \u0026ldquo;alpha and the omega,\u0026rdquo; just as he did in the previous passage where he explained the meaning of \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo;. Yahweh also explains that he is sending a message to all humans of the Earth through his prophet, Raël, and that they are loved as if they were their own children. The message is directed towards those who have been created by the Elohim and have been guided towards the Golden Age.\nOur take # In traditional Christian theology, \u0026ldquo;the Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is interpreted as a title for God and as a reference to the book of Revelation in the Bible. It is a symbol of God\u0026rsquo;s eternal nature and power over all creation, as God existed before all things and will exist beyond the end of all things. This phrase is also a reference to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, suggesting that God is the beginning and the end of all things. In this sense, the \u0026ldquo;Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is a powerful symbol of God\u0026rsquo;s supreme authority, sovereignty, and divinity, as well as an assurance of God\u0026rsquo;s faithful presence throughout all of human history.\nAs pointed out by Yahweh himself, \u0026ldquo;The Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is a phrase used in the Book of Revelation that represents the beginning and the end, or the first and the last, suggesting that the Elohim, in particular Yahweh himself as their representative, are quasi immortal. In the context of the Raëlian messages, Yahweh describes himself as the Alpha and the Omega, indicating that he was the first on Earth, and he will be the last if men self-destroy. He explains that they have the technology to re-create a person\u0026rsquo;s body with new living matter and that their minds can be immortal, leading to eternal life. This implies that the \u0026ldquo;Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; could be a symbol of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s ability to create and recreate life, as well as their role in guiding humanity towards progress and enlightenment.\nSee also # Wiki › Elohim Wiki › Raëlism External links # Yahweh | Wikipedia Tetragrammaton | Wikipedia Alpha and Omega | Wikipedia Jehovah | Jewish Encyclopedia It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that Yahweh is sometimes anglicized as Jehovah, a rendering that originated from combining the consonants of YHWH with the vowels from Adonai.

Within that band, there are 12 stellar constellations to be found which each are named after an animal. The Zodiac provides therefore the zoological symbols to properly name the position of the sun in the sky. Over the years, the relative position of the Zodiac shifts eastwards along the ecliptic due to the phenomenon of precession. With that understanding, the zodiac can be understood as the basis for the naming of 12 houses within a long-lasting cycle each denominating a given world age.","content":"The Zodiac is a band of the sky that extends approximately 8 degrees on either side of the ecliptic, the sun\u0026rsquo;s apparent path through the sky. It is divided into twelve equal parts, called signs, which are named after the constellations of stars that lie along the ecliptic. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.\nThe origins of the Zodiac date back to ancient Babylonian culture, where it was used for astronomical purposes and to understand the movements and relationships of the sun, moon, and planets. The Babylonians divided the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, each corresponding to one of the twelve constellations that lie along the sun\u0026rsquo;s path, and assigned a name and symbolic representation to each one.\nOver time, the concept of the Zodiac was adopted and developed by other cultures, including the ancient Greeks, who added further details and interpretations to the signs and constellations. In Greek culture, the Zodiac was associated with the stories and myths of their gods and heroes, and the signs and constellations were thought to have special powers and influence over the lives of individuals.\nThe Zodiac is still used today, primarily in astrology, where the positions and movements of the celestial bodies are thought to have a direct impact on human affairs and the lives of individuals. In astrology, the twelve signs of the Zodiac are believed to have specific characteristics and personality traits, and the position of the sun, moon, and planets at the time of a person\u0026rsquo;s birth is thought to shape their personality and life path.\nEtymology # The word \u0026ldquo;Zodiac\u0026rdquo; is derived from the Greek word \u0026ldquo;zōdiakos kyklos\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;circle of animals.\u0026rdquo; This term was used to describe the band of the sky containing the twelve constellations of the zodiac, which were symbolized by various animals and creatures, such as a ram (Aries), bull (Taurus), twins (Gemini), crab (Cancer), lion (Leo), virgin (Virgo), scales (Libra), scorpion (Scorpio), archer (Sagittarius), goat (Capricorn), water-bearer (Aquarius), and fish (Pisces).\nEastward shift # The shift of the zodiac over the years is due to the phenomenon of precession. Precession is a slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis that causes the direction of the axis to trace out a large circle in the sky over a period of 26,000 years. This movement causes the positions of the stars as seen from the Earth to appear to change over time, and it also affects the positions of the equinoxes, which mark the beginning of the zodiac constellations.\nThe effect of precession on the zodiac is that the equinoxes slowly move westward along the ecliptic, which is the path of the sun through the sky, relative to the fixed stars. As a result, over the course of several thousand years, the sun appears to move through different zodiac constellations on the spring equinox, which marks the beginning of the astrological year.\nFor example, around 2,000 years ago, the sun rose in the constellation of Aries on the spring equinox. Today, the sun rises in the constellation of Pisces on the spring equinox, and in the next few thousand years, it will rise in the constellation of Aquarius.\nMazzaroth # The term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; refers to a concept in some ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Babylonians, Persians, and others, which refers to the zodiac and the cycle of the year. The term is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;mazzalot,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;constellations.\u0026rdquo;\nIn this context, the term Mazzaroth refers to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, which are aligned with the sun\u0026rsquo;s path through the sky over the course of the year. The concept of the Mazzaroth was used to mark the passage of time and to understand the changing seasons and cycles of nature.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; is also mentioned in the book of Job in the Hebrew Bible, where it is used as a metaphor for the order and structure of the universe and the sovereignty of God over all things.\nIn summary, the term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; refers to the concept of the zodiac and the cycle of the year in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Babylonians and Persians. The term is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;mazzalot\u0026rdquo; and was used to mark the passage of time and understand the changing seasons and cycles of nature.\nGospel in the Stars # The Gospel in the Stars hypothesis is a biblical interpretation that suggests that the twelve constellations of the zodiac, along with the positions and movements of the celestial bodies within them, tell the story of God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation for humanity. Proponents of this theory believe that the constellations and celestial bodies are not just random arrangements of stars, but rather have been deliberately placed in the sky by God to communicate a message to humanity.\nAccording to the Gospel in the Stars hypothesis, the twelve constellations of the zodiac symbolize the twelve sons of Jacob, who are the forefathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. The movements and positions of the sun, moon, and planets within these constellations are thought to represent key events and stages in the salvation history of humanity, such as the creation of the world, the fall of man, the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the future return of Christ.\nThe Gospel in the Stars hypothesis is not a widely accepted scientific or biblical interpretation and has been criticized by scholars and theologians for its lack of evidence and its reliance on speculative and subjective interpretations of the stars and celestial bodies.\nSee also # Wiki › Precession Read more # Resources › Frances Rolleston — Mazzaroth; or, The constellations (1862) Resources › Joseph A.
