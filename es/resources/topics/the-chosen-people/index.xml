It is divided into three sections: the Torah (Teaching or Law), the Nevi&amp;rsquo;im (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). The word &amp;ldquo;Tanakh&amp;rdquo; is an acronym derived from these three divisions.
The Torah (Law or Teaching): Also known as the Pentateuch, the Torah comprises the first five books of the Bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</description></item><item><title>The Engagement</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/es/resources/the-engagement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/es/resources/the-engagement/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The Engagement&amp;rdquo; is a proposal addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It suggests that the conflict in the Holy Land, primarily between Jewish and Palestinian communities, represents a clash of civilizations rooted in a deep and intensive encounter between Western (Judeo-Christian) and Middle Eastern (Arab-Muslim) cultures. The proposal argues that about 80-90% of Palestinians are descendants of the People of Israel, who remained in the country after the destruction of the Second Jewish Temple and were forced to convert to Islam.</description></item></channel></rss>
