Proponents of the theory suggest that evidence of these interactions can be seen in ancient art, legends, and architecture, which they claim cannot be fully explained by conventional historical and scientific explanations. They also argue that certain technological and cultural advancements in human history, such as the building of the pyramids in Egypt or the creation of the Nazca lines in Peru, could not have been achieved without outside influence.</description></item><item><title>Ancient Builders</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/wiki/ancient-builders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/wiki/ancient-builders/</guid><description>Ancient Builders typically refers to the architects, engineers, and skilled workers who created structures, such as buildings, temples, pyramids, and other monumental structures, in ancient civilizations.

It combines knowledge from astronomy, biology, geology, and other sciences to understand the conditions necessary for life to exist, both on Earth and elsewhere. To research the possibility of extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists use various techniques and tools such as searching for evidence of past or present life on other planets, moons, or asteroids in our solar system, looking for signs of life on exoplanets around other stars, and studying the chemical and physical conditions necessary for life to form and survive.</description></item></channel></rss>
