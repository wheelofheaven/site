The Leviathan is a mythical sea monster mentioned in the Bible, specifically in the book of Job and in the book of Psalms. In the Bible, the Leviathan is described as a powerful and fearsome creature that lives in the sea and is difficult to control.

The Leviathan has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. In some interpretations, it is seen as a symbol of chaos and evil, while in others it is viewed as a symbol of the power of God and the natural order of the universe. In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, the Leviathan is often associated with the idea of a great, apocalyptic battle between good and evil, in which God will defeat the monster and restore order to the world.

In popular culture, the Leviathan has been depicted in many different ways, often as a giant sea serpent or dragon. It has also been used as a metaphor for various forms of evil, oppression, and tyranny throughout history. The image of the Leviathan continues to hold great cultural and symbolic significance, and it is often referenced in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture.

## Sea serpent in mythology

The depiction of multi-headed creatures, while unusual in biological terms, often finds representation in mythology and heraldry. Dragons with multiple heads, such as the 8-headed Orochi (大蛇) and 3-headed Trisiras, emerge frequently across various cultures. Greek mythology also tells of Heracles' battles against the 9-headed Lernaean Hydra and the 100-headed Ladon.

The number eight in such folklore tends to imply a sense of multiplicity or variation. Furthermore, narratives often feature gods or kings using dragons, particularly multi-headed ones, as their mode of transportation. These tales share common threads with legends across Cambodia, India, Persia, Western Asia, East Africa, and the Mediterranean region.

There is a recurring theme across mythologies involving a storm god battling a sea serpent—a possible motif originating from the Proto-Indo-European religion. This concept, termed chaoskampf (German for "struggle against chaos"), symbolizes the ongoing conflict between order and chaos. As these myths develop, the role of the storm god (often the leader of a pantheon) is frequently assumed by culture heroes or figures emblematic of royalty.

This motif appears in the battles between Thor and Jörmungandr in Norse mythology, Perun and Veles in Slavic mythology, Zeus and Typhon in Greek mythology, and others. A common variant of this theme involves a hero (often of extraordinary birth) confronting a dragon that demands the sacrifice of maidens or princesses. This type of narrative is ubiquitous and classified under the Aarne–Thompson–Uther index as ATU 300, "The Dragonslayer".

## Chaoskampf

The term Chaoskampf is derived from the German words "chaos" and "kampf", meaning struggle or battle. Chaos on the other hand originates from the Greek word χάος (kháos), which referred not so much to disorder or entropy as it does in the contemporary understanding, but rather to the vast, empty space that existed before the creation of the universe.[^chaos]

In ancient Greek cosmogony, Khaos was the primeval state of existence from which the first gods emerged. It represented the gap between heaven and earth, or more accurately, the gap that existed before heaven and earth were separated. This chasm, void, or limitless space is what was embodied by the term "Khaos".

When referring to "chaoskampf" in mythological terms, it is then a reference to the struggle that takes place within this primordial space or void. While it has come to symbolize the battle between order (represented by gods or heroes) and chaos (often embodied by multi-headed serpents or dragons), it could indeed be seen metaphorically as conflict amongst gods in the vast expanse of space.

This interpretation provides a different perspective on the concept, especially considering ancient astronaut theories and narratives that describe gods as extraterrestrial beings. In such contexts, the "chaoskampf" could very well represent real or metaphorical conflicts taking place in the cosmos, amongst beings who traverse or inhabit different worlds.

[^chaos]: The Greek term "kháos" (χάος) denotes concepts such as 'emptiness,' 'a vast void,' 'chasm,' or 'abyss.' It is connected to the Greek verbs "kháskō" (χάσκω) and "khaínō" (χαίνω), which mean 'to gape' or 'be wide open.' These words trace back to the Proto-Indo-European root "*ǵʰeh₂n-." This root is also a cognate to the Old English term "geanian," which means 'to gape.' The English term "yawn" has evolved from this Old English word.

## In Raëlism 🔯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim came to hide in the oceans:

> The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.
>
>> In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
>>
>> — Isaiah 27: 1.
>
> At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.

The Leviathan is the group of scientists led by Lucifer, also known as the Serpent, who had been banished at the outset and had hidden themselves in the oceans, and according to Isaiah 27:1, the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.
