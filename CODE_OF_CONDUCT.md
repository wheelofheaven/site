# Code of Conduct

Simple Code of Conduct. Without bloat. Basically, show dignity and integrity and don't trample around, and you're going to be fine.

## Principles

- Respect: Treat others as you'd like to be treated. No insults or personal attacks.
- Collaboration: Work together to build something great. Share knowledge and help others.
- Constructive feedback: Offer and accept feedback graciously. It's about content, not the person.
- Keep it professional: Stay focused on the project and its goals.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- No trolling, flaming, or spamming.
- Don't share others' personal information.
- Keep discussions on-topic and related to the project.

## Enforcement

Violations of this code may result in action from the project maintainers, including but not limited to removing content or banning from the project.
