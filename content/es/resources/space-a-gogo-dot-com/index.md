title: "Space a Go Go (archived website)"
description: "\"Space a Go Go\" is a website that presents the theory that humans were created by extraterrestrials, drawing on archaeological evidence and interpretations of ancient texts. It suggests that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrials who have been trying to make their existence known to humanity. The site references the work of Zecharia Sitchin, who claimed that ancient clay tablets from Iraq recorded the creation of humans by extraterrestrials. It also mentions geneticists questioning the natural evolution theory, suggesting that human genetic code indicates an extraterrestrial author. The site discusses the Elohim, who are said to have created all life on Earth, and their messages to Claude Vorilhon Rael. It challenges traditional religious beliefs and posits that atheism will be the norm in the 21st century. The site covers various topics including human gene design, ancient civilizations, commonalities in world myths, and the interpretation of biblical terms, asserting a connection between ancient scriptures and extraterrestrial influence."

### Our take

While the web site isn't well documented in terms explicitly stating sources and references, it just oozes with that nostalgic flair of the early days of the Internet.
