### Contents

The book is structured into three distinct sections, each focusing on different aspects of Rael's teachings and the beliefs of the Raelian Movement: "Frequently Asked Questions," "The New Revelations," and "An Atheist Religion."

1. **Frequently Asked Questions:** This chapter addresses various queries about Rael's experiences and the Raelian Movement's teachings. It clarifies apparent contradictions between Rael's earlier messages, explaining them in the context of psychological preparation and the evolving nature of human understanding​​. It also discusses the Elohim's role in creating life on Earth and their scientific advancements, as well as the significance of certain practices within the Raelian Movement, such as the transmission of the cellular plan and the preservation of the forehead bone after death​.

2. **The New Revelations:** This chapter discusses various topics, including his personal experiences with the Elohim, the nature of his mission as a messenger, and interpretations of religious texts and events in the context of the Raelian understanding. For instance, Rael reflects on the reasons why he was chosen as a messenger by the Elohim, elaborating on the significance of this role and the implications for humanity. He also reinterprets biblical texts, such as the Book of Revelation.

3. **An Atheist Religion:** This chapter delves into the paradox of the Raelian Movement being an atheist religion. It emphasizes the distinction between traditional religious beliefs in a deity and the Raelian understanding of the Elohim as advanced extraterrestrial creators. The chapter also reinterprets religious concepts and stories​.

The book addresses complex theological and philosophical questions, such as the origins of life on Earth, the nature of human evolution, and the potential for humans to achieve similar technological advancements as the Elohim. Rael's responses and teachings in this book aim to clarify and deepen the understanding of the Raelian philosophy, providing insights into how the Movement views humanity's place in the universe and our relationship with our purported creators, the Elohim.

### About Claude Vorhilon

Claude Vorilhon, who goes by the name Raël, is a French spiritual leader and founder of the Raelian movement. Born in 1946, Raël worked as a race car driver, journalist, and singer before claiming to have a spiritual encounter with extraterrestrial beings in 1973.

According to Raël, these beings instructed him to spread their message of peace and love to humanity and to establish an embassy for them on Earth. He founded the Raelian movement in 1974, and it has since grown to become a global organization with thousands of members around the world.

The Raëlian movement's teachings draw on a mix of science, religion, and philosophy, and emphasize the idea that humans are descended from extraterrestrial beings
