## The Twelve Houses

With the understanding of the [three key motions of the Earth](#the-great-year), we recognize that these celestial rhythms provide an intricate frame of reference that enables us to conceptualize and measure time. These cyclical motions share several intriguing characteristics:

+ **Definitive periodicity**: These motions, untouched by human intervention, depict a recurrent cosmic choreography, repeating the same patterns in a rhythmic cycle that is bound to start again once completed.
+ **Consistency of time elapse**: Because of this inherent periodicity, we can expect the exact same amount of time to elapse for a given cycle. This offers a degree of predictability and reliability unmatched by human-made systems.
+ **Granularity**: The natural segmentation of a full cycle provides smaller, discrete units of time, enabling us to perceive time in digestible bites, rather than overwhelming, continuous stretches.

These harmonious cosmic rhythms hold a profound sense of mystery and grandeur that exceeds our typical human scale of perception. Thus, using these celestial motions as a time-keeping framework becomes intuitively appealing, particularly because all three motions exhibit intervals that complement each other extraordinarily well.

The day, a product of the Earth's rotation, becomes a manageable unit to count a year, which in turn, stemming from the Earth's revolution, offers a feasible measure to gauge the enormity of the Great Year, a result of precession.

This interlocking of time scales gives rise to an intriguing pattern: the division of the rotation and revolution cycles into **12 units** each. This division, while seemingly arbitrary, has far-reaching implications when applied to the precession cycle or the **Great Year**.

Dividing the **Great Year** by twelve gives birth to a new time unit: the Great Month, each spanning a staggering `2,160 years`. This unit embodies a vast stretch of time, dwarfing our conventional year and providing a measure for time spans that cross the threshold of millennia.

The concept of the [Great Month]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/great-month.md" >}}) offers a larger temporal framework that encompasses the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of cultures and ideas, and the progress of scientific understanding. It gives us a perspective on time that goes beyond our personal or even historical experience, reaching into a scale that we usually reserve for geological or astronomical events.

Just as the daily and annual cycles are integral to our understanding of time, the Great Month could prove to be an essential tool for understanding longer-term trends and cycles. As our knowledge of our own (ancient) history, the constitution of planet Earth, and astronomical patterns continues to grow, we may find that the concept of the Great Month helps us make sense of patterns and events that span thousands of years, providing a broader context for understanding our place in the cosmos.

This broader framework of time, provided by the twelve houses of the Great Year, each a Great Month, enables us to comprehend vast stretches of time that would otherwise seem incomprehensible. It is a cosmic calendar that places our transient existence into a grand chronicle of the universe.

## Mapping the heavens into constellations

As we continue our cosmic voyage, let's pause to consider the age-old human practice of Earthly stargazing and the crucial role it has played in our understanding of the universe. As highlighted in the introduction, humans across cultures and epochs have turned their gaze upwards to the celestial theater, seeking to comprehend their position amidst the glittering array of heavenly bodies. This shared fascination transcends cultures, continents, and millennia, connecting us with our ancestors in a shared quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Early humans not only marveled at the stars but came up with an ingenious solution to navigate this overwhelming cosmic map: grouping the multitude of visible stars into meaningful clusters known as **constellations**. This form of early science was not only practical but ingeniously symbolic, layering each cluster with a mythological tale. Through these storied shapes, abstract cosmic data took on a narrative quality, anchoring spatial patterns in the memorable tales of gods, monsters, and heroes. The storytelling aspect is arguably as crucial as the spatial one; it facilitated knowledge transmission across generations, allowing the wisdom of the past to enlighten the present.

Armed with the ability to recognize these celestial patterns, humans could discern practical, actionable information, such as the timing of agricultural activities or navigation for long sea voyages. The constellations became our cosmic compass, guiding our way through the seasons and across vast bodies of water.

Yet, the stellar canvas is not static. As we just learned a few paragraphs earlier, the gradual progression of axial precession, despite its subtle nature, inexorably reshapes the constellations' arrangement in the night sky. This slow celestial dance, overlooked by casual observers, becomes apparent to those invested in careful, long-term celestial tracking. With axial precession taking approximately `25'920 years` for a full cycle, a shift of `1¬∞` on the celestial sphere equates to a time span of `72 years`, roughly aligning with an average human lifetime. Remarkably, this `1¬∞` shift is also closely proportional to the combined apparent diameter of the Sun and the Moon in our sky.

Such findings underscore the sheer complexity of observing and comprehending axial precession. Without efficient means for inter-generational persistence of empirical knowledge, the task becomes even more daunting. Yet, humanity's enduring curiosity and capacity for pattern recognition have allowed us to pierce this cosmic mystery, using nothing more than our naked eyes and the night sky as a canvas for our stories and mathematical explorations.

## Marking Time: The Importance of Cardinal Days in a Year

Before we continue our cosmic journey, it's crucial to focus on another distinctive aspect of Earth's annual journey around the Sun, influenced by the planet's [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt) of `23.44¬∞` in relation to its orbital plane. This tilt not only gives our planet its characteristic seasonal rhythm but also impacts how we perceive the Sun's light throughout the year.

Let's delve a bit deeper into these astronomical concepts. The **celestial equator** is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the sky, while the **ecliptic** is the apparent path the Sun traces in this celestial sphere due to Earth's revolution. The celestial equator and ecliptic intersect twice a year at two specific points, marking the **spring and autumnal equinoxes**. These equinoxes signify the moment when the duration of day and night is equal across the globe. The **spring equinox** (also known as the **vernal equinox**) typically occurs on the 20<sup>th</sup> of March, and the **autumnal equinox** around the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September.

Conversely, the **summer and winter solstices** denote the moments when one hemisphere of the Earth experiences the longest day or longest night of the year, respectively. The **summer solstice** generally falls on the 21<sup>st</sup> of June, while the **winter solstice** occurs around the 21<sup>st</sup> of December.

These equinoxes and solstices - the **cardinal days** - are considered pivotal astronomical milestones in our calendar, marking the start of each season.

| Cardinality         | Day in a year                  | Perceptibility                           |
| -                   | -                              | -                                        |
| **Vernal equinox**  | ~ 20<sup>th</sup> of March     | Day and night of equal length            |
| **Summer solstice** | ~ 21<sup>st</sup> of June      | Longest day in the Northern Hemisphere    |
| **Autumn equinox**  | ~ 22<sup>nd</sup> of September | Day and night of equal length            |
| **Winter solstice** | ~ 21<sup>st</sup> of December  | Longest night in the Northern Hemisphere  |

Bear in mind that an equinox or solstice represents a specific moment in time when the **celestial equator** aligns with the **ecliptic**, not an entire day. Another way to define an equinox is the moment when the visible Sun's center is directly over the Earth's equator.

Viewing Earth as a grand celestial clockwork, the cardinal days can be seen as markers for the **four quadrants** on a clock face. In essence, if we were to pick a moment to compare celestial measurements, the cardinal days, particularly the **equinoxes**, would be the most desirable due to their globally observable characteristics.

## Astronomical watchmaking

Navigating the intricate choreography of Earth's three key motions - two of which present a rapid periodicity - is a demanding task, particularly when trying to discern the glacial pace of the third motion, the **precession**. Its slow, stately progression requires the observer to select a specific moment each year for stellar observation, akin to the interplay of distinct mechanisms within a mechanical wristwatch that work in harmony to accurately portray time. Just as a wristwatch employs a time reference, typically `0` or `12 o'clock`, the Great Year also calls for a defining point of reference.

To construct our model of an astronomical timepiece, we need to consider specific reference points, namely:

+ **First motion [rotation]**: Sunrise, which heralds the start of a new day
+ **Second motion [revolution]**: Spring Equinox, marking the arrival of a new cycle of seasons
+ **Geographical point of reference**: Due East, the direction from which the Sun makes its daily ascent

By leveraging these sensible parameters to establish our 'zero' point, we can now observe the celestial tapestry ‚Äì the stars or constellations ‚Äì unfolding against the backdrop of the **Great Year**.

One might then wonder, what constellation graces the pre-dawn sky on the spring equinox, rising in unison with the Sun due east, **in our current era**?

{{< figure src="images/20202003_vernal_equinox_stellarium.jpg" caption="Fig. 2 - Vernal equinox on the 20<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 due east, taken with Stellarium" >}}

As we look to the heavens, we find ourselves at the threshold of a cosmic shift, where the constellation of Pisces is giving way to the upcoming constellation of Aquarius. This celestial transition silently marks the passage of millennia, a grand celestial clock advancing into a new age. This is the precise moment where the ancient and the current converge, providing us with an invaluable glimpse into the cosmic shift into a new age. A new age that could have been easily predicted for millenia if the awareness and knowledge about axial precession were given.

## The Cycle of Zodiacal Ages

Our prior assumptions about celestial observations and their correlation with the slow progression of the precession of the equinoxes were not arbitrary. This understanding is deeply rooted in antiquity. This exploration propounds that the _Zodiac's genesis is intrinsically linked to precession_. The term [Zodiac]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/zodiac.md" >}}) refers to a group of 12 constellations, whose mention transcends written history and cultural boundaries. Undeniably, the Zodiac and its derivative study, now known as astrology, have been of significance for thousands of years.

The oldest known civilization, the Sumerians, had profound respect and knowledge of the Zodiac. Linking the precession to the Zodiac is controversial, as it implies comprehensive understanding of the former, requiring considerable scientific knowledge including the concept of Earth as a globe. To attribute such cosmological insights to the earliest known civilization would challenge the contemporary consensus on known history, casting doubt on the linear and gradual narrative of human progress. Such a perspective could provide a basis for alternative narratives.

Returning to the Zodiac, the term originates from Ancient Greek z≈çidiak√≤s k√Ωklos (Œ∂·ø≥Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ) meaning _'cycle or circle of carved animals'[^zodiac]. However, in non-Indo-European languages, the Zodiac has different names. In Biblical Hebrew, the Zodiac is called **Mazzaroth** (◊û÷∑◊ñ÷∏÷º◊®◊ï÷π◊™), translating to *'garland of crowns'*[‚Ü©Ô∏é](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4626-constellations). The phrase *'mazel tov'* (◊û◊ñ◊ú ◊ò◊ï◊ë‚Äé), wishing *good luck* or more accurately *good fortune*, derives from *mazzaroth*. In Chinese logograms, the Zodiac is referred to as Áç£Â∏Ø, meaning *'animal belt'*.

The Zodiac comprises `12 constellations`, twelve signs. These twelve constellations are part of the ecliptic. This is no mere coincidence, as it is precisely the ecliptic which aligns with the celestial equator on the equinoxes (refer [Cardinal days in a year and their importance](#cardinal-days-in-a-year-and-their-importance)).

If following the ecliptic on the equinoxes is indeed the correct method to track the precession's progression, the Great Year, then the twelve constellations positioned along the ecliptic indeed represent the twelve houses or the twelve **Great Months** for a given **Great Year**. As we've established [earlier](#the-twelve-houses), dividing the Great Year into twelve houses makes each house last `2'160 years`.

One might wonder whether we have already transitioned into the [Age of Aquarius]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-aquarius.md" >}}) or are still in the [Age of Pisces]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-aquarius.md" >}}). To answer this, one must first understand when the precessional cycle initially began, or more specifically, when a given house precisely begins or ends. Unfortunately, this isn't easy to determine without significant assumptions. However, it is clear that as we progress through the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, the possibility of being in the new **Age of Aquarius** increases.

>  Aquarius is both a constellation and the twelfth of a circle known as a sign. Entering Aquarius means entering the period during which astronomers will see the sun rise in Aquarius on the day of the vernal equinox. The phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes is involved in this fact. The equinoctial sun has been rising in the sign of Aquarius since 1950. In this interpretation, we are in the 'Golden Age' of prophecies. The equinoctial sun will not begin rising in the constellation of Aquarius until about the year 2700. In this interpretation, neither you nor I will see the prophesied 'Golden Age'.
>
> -- Jean Sendy: Coming Of The Gods (1970), p. 69

The duration of a house could also be determined by the size of a given constellation in the sky. However, this would be a poorly defined assumption as the shapes of Zodiacal constellations vary greatly. Pisces, for instance, has a considerably large constellation, particularly in ecliptic length, whereas Aquarius is comparably short. There is a significant gap between these two constellations. It's important to note that the duration of a Great Month is 2'160 years, mimicking the twelfth section of its parent year cycle. For reasons that may be highlighted in future discussions, the year `1'950 AD` as the beginning of the Age of Aquarius appears to be our best assumption for now.

Based on these assumptions, calculating the **Zodiacal Ages** backward by decrements of `2'160 years`, we arrive at the following table:

| Zodiacal age              | Time span```
| -                         | -                    | -                           |
| :capricorn: Capricorn     | 21'810 -- 19'650 BC  | Sea goat, Mountain Goat     |
| :sagittarius: Sagittarius | 19'650 -- 17'490 BC  | Archer, Centaur             |
| :scorpius: Scorpio        | 17'490 -- 15'330 BC  | Eagle, Phoenix              |
| :libra: Libra             | 15'330 -- 13'170 BC  | Scales, Balance             |
| :virgo: Virgo             | 13'170 -- 11'010 BC  | Virgin, Grain Goddess       |
| :leo: Leo                 | 11'010 -- 8'850 BC   | Lion, Nemean Lion           |
| :cancer: Cancer           | 8'850 -- 6'690 BC    | Crab, Scarab, Turtle        |
| :gemini: Gemini           | 6'690 -- 4'530 BC    | Twins, Dioscuri             |
| :taurus: Taurus           | 4'530 -- 2'370 BC    | Bull, Calf, Bison           |
| :aries: Aries             | 2'370 -- 210 BC      | Ram, Golden Fleece          |
| :pisces: Pisces           | 210 BC -- 1'950 AD   | Fishes, Twin Fish           |
| :aquarius: Aquarius       | 1'950 AD -- 4'110 AD | Water Bearer, Fountain      |

These denote the [World Ages]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/world-age.md" >}}) of the past. Looking into the future, after Aquarius comes Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, and so on. The relevance of these ages extends beyond simply knowing the hour of a day, the day of a year, or the age of ages. Understanding precession and tracking it through ecliptic constellations allows us to position ourselves within larger timescales. It is a conventional way of referring to vast time spans surpassing mere years. If there's anything worthy of measuring **World Ages**, employing the Earth's third key motion, enabling millennia-long time references, is surely the most intelligent approach.

If our Earth's inhabitants employed this understanding in the past, could we now comprehend what they might have meant when referring to *world ages* or *aeons* of time?

[^zodiac]: According to Merriam-Webster, the term zodiac has the following definitions: a) Zodiac refers to an imaginary band in the celestial sphere that is centered on the ecliptic, encompassing the apparent paths of all the planets. It is divided into 12 constellations or signs, with each sign considered to extend 30 degrees of longitude, and is commonly used in astrology. b) Zodiac can also refer to a figure that represents the signs of the zodiac and their corresponding symbols, often used in astrological charts or illustrations. See here for more: [zodiac | Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zodiac)

## Encoding

Past civilizations have not only known about the **precession of the equinox**, but they have also endeavored to preserve this sacred knowledge. This preservation occurred in two notable forms: **language** and **constructions**. Both these forms served as mechanisms of encoding that have carried this ancient wisdom through ages, allowing it to transcend the ravages of time and cultural shifts.

### Hamlet's Mill

In 1969, a groundbreaking work was published that would provide an intricate insight into the encoded understanding of the precession of the equinoxes. This knowledge, the authors proposed, had its roots in an ancestral civilization characterized by a highly sophisticated understanding of the cosmos. This civilization, they claimed, had transmitted this knowledge through subsequent world civilizations, encoded within the rich tapestry of mythical images and narratives.

This remarkable study was conducted by Giorgio de Santillana (1902‚Äì1974), a professor of history of science at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hertha von Dechend (1915‚Äì2001), a professor of history of science, philosophy, and ethnology at the University of Frankfurt. Together they co-authored *Hamlet‚Äôs Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth*.

Their book offers a revolutionary perspective, emphasizing the holistic and interconnected nature of archaic thought, and the profound role the celestial dynamics played in shaping their worldview. Let's allow their words to elucidate:

> "To begin with, there is no system that can be presented in modern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are no principles from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes from a time when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, and it would be unfair to search for one. There could hardly have been one among people who committed all their ideas to memory. It can be considered a pure structure of numbers. From the beginning, we considered calling this essay 'Art of the Fugue.' And that excludes any 'world-picture,' a point that cannot be stressed strongly enough. Any effort to use a diagram is bound to lead into contradiction. It is a matter of times and rhythm."
>
> "The subject has the nature of a hologram, something that has to be present as a whole to the mind. Archaic thought is cosmological first and last; it faces the gravest implications of a cosmos in ways which reverberate in later classic philosophy. The chief implication is a profound awareness that the fabric of the cosmos is not only determined, but overdetermined and in a way that does not permit the simple location of any of its agents, whether simple magic or astrology, forces, gods, numbers, planetary powers, Platonic Forms, Aristotelian Essences or Stoic Substances. Physical reality here cannot be analytical in the Cartesian sense; it cannot be reduced to concreteness even if misplaced. Being is change, motion, and rhythm, the irresistible circle of time, the incidence of the 'right moment', as determined by the skies."
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet‚Äôs Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.56

Santillana and von Dechend challenge the modern perception of precession as a trivial celestial motion and invoke the grand vision our ancestors had towards this cycle. They argue that the precession, for our forebears, represented a majestic secular motion ‚Äî a peg on which they hung their profound thoughts about cosmic time:

> "We today are aware of the Precession as the gentle tilting of our globe, an irrelevant one at that. As the GI said, lost in the depth of jungle misery, when his friends took refuge in their daydreams: 'When I close my eyes, I see only a mule's behind. Also when I don't.' This is, as it were, today's vision of reality. Today, the Precession is a well-established fact. The space-time continuum does not affect it. It is by now only a boring complication. It has lost relevance for our affairs, whereas once it was the only majestic secular motion that our ancestors could keep in mind when they looked for a great cycle which could affect humanity as a whole. But then our ancestors were astronomers and astrologers. They believed that the sliding of the sun along the equinoctial point affected the frame of the cosmos and determined a succession of world-ages under different zodiacal signs. They had found a large peg on which to hang their thoughts about cosmic time, which brought all things in fateful order. Today, that order has lapsed, like the idea of the cosmos itself. There is only history, which has been felicitously defined as 'one damn thing after another.'"
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet‚Äôs Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.67-68

The authors take a step further to explore the fundamental divide between archaic and modern ways of interpreting the cosmos. They argue that the key to understanding archaic thought is through astrology, a cosmic language that encapsulated their profound sense of correspondences and deterministic principles:

> "The greatest gap between archaic thinking and modern thinking is in the use of astrology. By this is not meant the common or judicial astrology which has become once again a fad and a fashion among the ignorant public, an escape from official science, and for the vulgar another kind of black art of vast prestige but with principles equally uncomprehended. It is necessary to go back to archaic times, to a universe totally unsuspecting of our science and of the experimental method on which it is founded, unaware of the awful art of separation which distinguishes the verifiable from the unverifiable. This was a time, rich in another knowledge which was later lost, that searched for other principles. It gave the lingua franca of the past. Its knowledge was of cosmic correspondences, which found their proof and seal of truth in a specific determinism, nay overdeterminism, subject to forces completely without locality."
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet‚Äôs Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.74

### The Language of Mythology

The authors posited that mythology, often overlooked as mere fanciful stories, served as a complex and subtle medium for encoding this ancient wisdom. These tales, spun with cryptic symbolism, were carefully woven tapestries hiding a coded language that mirrored the cosmos' movements and cycles. This language, unlike our contemporary scientific language, expressed relationships, patterns, and correspondences rather than explicit cause-and-effect relationships.

The second form of preservation, constructions, refers to the architectural marvels of the past, whose sophistication and precision in alignment with celestial bodies still bewilder modern researchers. These constructions - from the Pyramids of Giza to Stonehenge, and from the Mayan temples to the complex layout of Angkor Wat - all reflect an acute understanding of celestial mechanics and a desire to embody these cosmic rhythms in earthly form. They stand as colossal markers of a civilization's understanding of the cosmos, aligning earthly and heavenly cycles into a harmonious, integrated whole.

The legacy of these ancient civilizations and their profound cosmic understanding continues to whisper its wisdom to us, hidden in the language of myth and the stones of ancient constructions. As we decode these messages and comprehend their significance, we might re-discover a worldview that paints a more connected, harmonious, and rhythmically flowing cosmos, echoing the complex symphony of the precession of the equinox. This understanding may invite us to reconsider our place in the cosmos, not as detached observers, but as participants in a grand, cyclic dance of celestial bodies and cosmic time.

#### Zodiacal Constructions as Time Markers

[Archaeoastronomy]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/archaeoastronomy.md" >}}), the study of how past civilizations understood phenomena in the sky and how they utilized this knowledge in their cultures, is a captivating blend of anthropology, astronomy, history, and archaeology. This discipline's foundation can be traced back to key figures like Joseph Norman Lockyer (1836‚Äì1920), who is renowned for his discovery of helium. As the founder and first editor of the influential journal *Nature*, he took an avid interest in astronomical alignments in ancient buildings, even penning *The Dawn of Astronomy - A Study of the Temple Worship and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians (1894)*[^1^], one of the earliest archaeoastronomical works.

When discussing archaeoastronomy, it is impossible to overlook the *Giza pyramid complex*‚Äîan iconic example of ancient constructions that reflect a deep understanding of celestial bodies. The pyramids mirror a non-zodiacal star constellation, and there's a statue known as the *Sphinx*, bearing a striking resemblance to Leo‚Äîthe fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac, possibly denoting the [Age of Leo]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-leo.md" >}}). The *Pyramid of Khufu* is of particular interest because of its ability to mark the day of an equinox. This feature is a testament to the extraordinary craftsmanship and scientific sophistication of the civilization that built it.

The *Pyramid of Khufu*, also known as the *Great Pyramid*, has a unique eight-sided structure, rather than the four sides typically associated with pyramids. This design enables the sun's light to *mark* the construction when the light comes from a direct, perpendicular direction towards a given side of the pyramid. Considering the *Pyramid of Khufu*'s precise alignment with the North, there are only two days in a year‚Äîthe equinoctial days‚Äîwhen the pyramid can be *marked* as seemingly intended.

A fascinating insight into the unusual design of the Great Pyramid comes from J.P. Lepre's comprehensive work, *The Egyptian Pyramids: A Comprehensive, Illustrated Reference (1990)*[^2^]:

> One very unusual feature of the Great Pyramid is a concavity of the core that makes the  monument  an  eight-sided  figure,  rather  than  four-sided  like  every  other Egyptian pyramid. That is to say, that its four  sides are hollowed in or indented along  their  central  lines, from  base  to  peak.  This  concavity  divides  each of  the apparent four sides in half, creating a very special and unusual eight-sided pyramid; and it is executed to such an extraordinary degree of precision as to enter the realm of the uncanny...

The *Great Pyramid* was clearly designed and built with astronomical knowledge in mind, indicating equinoctial sunrises and sunsets and marking the progression of the precession[^3^]. Furthermore, there is evidence of Zodiac symbolism within the *Giza pyramid complex*. The Sphinx, a lion-like figure, faces due East, directly towards the rising Sun on equinoctial days. This position implies the Sphinx looks at the Zodiacal constellation hiding behind the Sun at these precise moments‚Äîdoes this mean it is a nod to the Zodiac sign Leo?

While this interpretation may seem conjectural, the more we learn about these ancient civilizations and their understanding of the cosmos, the more plausible it becomes. The law of *Occam's razor*‚Äîthat entities should not be multiplied without necessity‚Äîsuggests that the more congruent factors we find in the construction of these monumental buildings, the more likely it is that this highly sophisticated astronomical knowledge has been applied universally.

## Summing It Up

The Great Year and its Twelve Houses have intriguing aspects that tie in closely with the Earth's three key motions, particularly the precession. This slow westward shift of the equinoxes along the plane of the ecliptic, resulting from the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation, causes the equinoxes to occur earlier each sidereal year. A complete precession cycle takes around `25,920 years`, marking the Great Year.

This Great Year can be divided into twelve distinct months or World Ages, each lasting `2,160 years` and corresponding to one of the constellations on the ecliptic, specifically a Zodiac sign. From `1950 AD`, Earth and its inhabitants entered the Age of Aquarius, also referred to as the Aquarian Age or the [New Age]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/golden-age.md" >}}). This understanding of World Ages seems to have persisted throughout history, encoded into folklore and monumental construction, which continues to inspire awe today.

This understanding of the cosmos that's embedded in ancient structures such as the Giza pyramids implies a civilization far advanced for its time. This notion may not conform to the traditional narrative of human progress, but it increasingly aligns with the body of knowledge unearthed through archaeoastronomy. The advanced knowledge, as demonstrated by the construction techniques, and the remarkable understanding of celestial bodies, suggest the existence of a pre-flood civilization that had mastered the art of astronomical timekeeping.

Astrological ages, as depicted in the Great Year and the Twelve Houses, provide a comprehensive chronology that has been utilized for millennia. These World Ages are not merely relics of the past, but they hold predictive power, serving as a celestial calendar of what's to come. The progression from one astrological age to the next signifies both an astronomical shift and a sociocultural transition. Each age carries its unique character, influencing the zeitgeist and the course of human development.

It's fascinating to consider that these civilizations, thousands of years in our past, possessed an understanding of time that we are only beginning to fully appreciate. They saw time not as linear but cyclical, marked by the celestial dance of stars and planets. It seems that they understood the inherent rhythms of the cosmos and our planet's place within it, a wisdom that they encoded into their greatest monuments.

This glimpse into the past serves not only as a testament to the accomplishments of these ancient civilizations, but it also invites us to see the future in a new light. As we move further into the Age of Aquarius, we might find that the knowledge held by our ancestors can guide us in navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. After all, the ancients viewed the cosmos not as a vast, empty space, but as a grand celestial clock, a timeless guide inscribed with the wisdom of ages past, present, and future.

The narrative presented here has been simplified for ease of understanding, but each topic warrants deeper exploration. Future write-ups will delve more deeply into each aspect, shedding more light on our ancestors' relationship with the cosmos.
