"Kosmographia — The Official Randall Carlson Podcast" is a thought-provoking and in-depth podcast series hosted by Randall Carlson, a renowned geological and architectural theorist, teacher, and scholar. The podcast delves into a wide array of subjects that intersect science, mythology, geology, and ancient history, reflecting Carlson's multifaceted interests and expertise.

Carlson, known for his meticulous research and comprehensive knowledge, explores theories and evidence related to Earth's geological history, catastrophic events, and the mysteries of ancient civilizations. He often discusses the impact of cosmic events, such as comet impacts and ice age cycles, on the shaping of our planet and human history. His discussions are backed by scientific data, yet they are presented in a way that is accessible and engaging to a broad audience.

A significant focus of the podcast is on the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which suggests that a comet impact around 12,800 years ago led to significant climate changes and affected early human civilizations. Carlson elaborates on how this event could explain various geological formations, myths, and legends from different cultures around the world.

Carlson also delves into sacred geometry and ancient architecture, examining how ancient builders possibly encoded advanced mathematical and astronomical knowledge into their structures. This leads to broader discussions about the capabilities and knowledge of ancient civilizations, challenging conventional historical narratives.

The podcast often features interviews and discussions with other experts, bringing in diverse perspectives and fostering a multidisciplinary dialogue. These conversations delve into topics like climate change, archaeological discoveries, and the potential for future cataclysmic events, always linking back to the larger themes of cosmic cycles and the interconnectedness of the universe.

"Kosmographia" is more than just a scientific or historical podcast; it is a platform that encourages listeners to think critically about the world, question mainstream narratives, and consider the possibilities of what might have been and what might be. It appeals to those who are curious about the mysteries of the past, the intricacies of our planet, and the potential future courses of human civilization.
