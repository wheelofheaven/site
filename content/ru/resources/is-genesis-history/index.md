Is Genesis History?" is a 2017 American film directed by Thomas Purifoy Jr., which presents the perspective of Young Earth creationism. This form of creation science challenges established scientific facts regarding the origins of the universe, Earth, solar system, and life itself, advocating for a literal interpretation of the biblical narratives. The film posits that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days and supports the Genesis accounts of Adam and Eve, the fall, a global flood, and the Tower of Babel.

Del Tackett, the creator of "The Truth Project," narrates the film, which features interviews with thirteen creationists who argue that the Genesis account represents real historical events. Other notable speakers in the film include George Grant, Paul Nelson, Marcus R. Ross, Andrew A. Snelling, Kurt Wise, and Larry Vardiman in the bonus features. The inspiration for the film came after Purifoy's daughter watched the Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate in 2014, which spurred questions about the creation-evolution controversy​.

The film was released in American theaters on February 23, 2017, and it was shown in 704 theaters. This debut made it the highest-grossing film in the United States that night. A special anniversary screening took place on February 22, 2018, in approximately 850 theaters, featuring a bonus scene with Wheaton College students touring the Ark Encounter, a creationist attraction. This event sparked controversy among the faculty of Wheaton College, most of whom reject the historical creationism narrative presented in the film​.

The documentary features over a dozen scientists and scholars explaining how the world intersects with the history recorded in Genesis. It covers a range of topics, including paradigms, created kinds, the fossil record, DNA, transitional forms, historical views on evolution, ecosystems, the global flood, starlight, the Tower of Babel, the Big Bang theory, rock layers, genealogies, isotope dating, and beauty. The film aims to address the question of whether the biblical account of creation and the flood should be understood as historical events, and whether the world provides evidence of recent creation and a catastrophic flood​​.

Many of the scientists and scholars featured in the film view Genesis as key to understanding the world around us, having spent decades in their respective fields exploring its relationship to the history recorded in the Bible​.

### Synopsis

"Is Genesis History?" is a documentary film that delves into the debate between traditional scientific theories about the origins of the universe, Earth, and life, and the Young Earth creationism perspective, which interprets the Genesis account of creation as literal historical fact. The film is structured around a series of interviews and explorations conducted by Dr. Del Tackett, the creator of "The Truth Project." Tackett travels to various locations, including landscapes like canyons, mountains, and underwater environments, to investigate and present evidence that supports the Young Earth creationist viewpoint.

The film features over a dozen scientists and scholars from various fields who argue in favor of the creationist interpretation. These experts discuss a wide range of topics to support their views:

- Paradigms: The film examines different frameworks of understanding the world, contrasting the mainstream scientific paradigm with the creationist view.
- Created Kinds: It discusses the concept of "kinds" as described in Genesis, in opposition to the theory of evolution.
- Fossil Record: The documentary explores the fossil record, arguing that it supports the idea of a global flood rather than gradual geological processes.
- DNA and Transitional Forms: It examines genetic evidence and the absence (as claimed in the film) of transitional forms in the fossil record.
- Historic Views on Evolution and Ecosystems: The film addresses historical perspectives on evolution and the complexity of ecosystems.
- Global Flood and Starlight: It presents arguments for a global flood and discusses astronomical evidence.
- Tower of Babel and Big Bang: The film covers biblical events like the Tower of Babel and contrasts the Big Bang theory with creationist beliefs.
- Rock Layers and Genealogies: It examines geological formations and biblical genealogies to argue for a young Earth.
- Isotope Dating: The film critiques isotope dating methods used in establishing the age of the Earth.
- Beauty: The documentary also delves into the concept of beauty in the natural world as evidence of intelligent design.

The overarching goal of "Is Genesis History?" is to make a compelling case for the creationist view of the Earth's and universe's origins, challenging established scientific theories and interpretations. The film asks whether the biblical account of creation and the flood can be understood as real history and whether the evidence in the natural world supports this view​.
