The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian poem, regarded as one of the earliest great works of literature. It narrates the adventures of Gilgamesh, the historical king of Uruk, and his quest for immortality, exploring themes of friendship, the human condition, and the fear of death. The epic, written in cuneiform on clay tablets, dates back to the early 3rd millennium BCE.

The story begins with the introduction of Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third human, who is a tyrannical king of Uruk. The gods create Enkidu, a wild man, to challenge Gilgamesh and divert his destructive behavior. After a fierce battle, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become close friends. They undertake a series of adventures, including the slaying of the monstrous guardian, Humbaba, in the Cedar Forest, and killing the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.

Enkidu's death, a punishment from the gods for these actions, deeply affects Gilgamesh, leading him to embark on a quest for immortality. He seeks Utnapishtim, the only human granted immortality by the gods, hoping to learn his secret. Utnapishtim recounts the Great Flood, a story remarkably similar to the biblical account of Noah's Ark, revealing that the gods decided to bestow immortality upon him as a reward for preserving life on a boat he built.

Gilgamesh's quest ultimately fails when he secures, then loses, a plant that bestows youth. The epic concludes with Gilgamesh accepting his mortality and returning to Uruk, where he finds wisdom in his achievements and the enduring legacy of his rule.

The discovery of the Epic of Gilgamesh, among other texts, in the ruins of the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh in the 19th century, was a major event in the field of Assyriology and ancient Near Eastern studies. It has since been translated into numerous languages and continues to be studied and admired for its profound insight into early human civilization and its enduring universal themes.
