### About Jean Sendy

Jean Sendy was a French author and esoteric writer who lived from 1910 to 1978. He is best known for his work on ancient astronauts and extraterrestrial intervention in human history. In his books, such as "Those Gods Who Made Heaven and Earth" and "The Coming of the Gods," Sendy explored the idea that human civilization was influenced or even created by beings from other planets.

Sendy's work drew on a range of sources, including mythology, ancient texts, and scientific theories, to develop his ideas. He argued that many ancient cultures and religions had similar myths and legends about gods or divine beings who came from the sky, and that these stories could be interpreted as evidence of extraterrestrial contact.

While Sendy's ideas were not widely accepted by mainstream scholars, his work had a significant impact on popular culture, and influenced later writers and researchers in the fields of ufology, ancient astronaut theory, and the search for extraterrestrial life.
