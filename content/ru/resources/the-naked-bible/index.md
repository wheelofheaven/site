"The Naked Bible" by Mauro Biglino and Giorgio Cattaneo is a reinterpretation of the Bible, stripping it of traditional interpretations. According to Biglino's research, once these layers are removed, the Bible reveals a very different narrative, one that does not involve a spiritual, almighty, and all-knowing God. The book challenges the very concept of eternity as traditionally understood in biblical context. This reinterpretation is a result of a comprehensive interview between Mauro Biglino and journalist Giorgio Cattaneo, exploring Biglino's extensive research on the subject​

### About Mauro Biglino

Translator of 19 books of the Old Testament for the prestigious Edizioni San Paolo, Mauro Biglino is an author, essayist and scholar of the history of religions who has been well known to the general public since 2010 with the publication of his first astonishing textual re-reading of the Bible, through 14 highly successful essays.

His work has earned him a great many enthusiasts, scholars and ordinary readers, whom he has guided – without prejudice or theological filters – through the fascinating narration of the biblical verses, examined in the original Hebrew. Biglino has worked with countless experts (biologists, archaeologists, engineers and doctors) who have supported his hypotheses regarding the possibility that the Bible contains evidence of the true origin of humanity, literally “manufactured” by a group of non-terrestrial individuals, the Elohim, subsequently transformed into divinities, starting with the first of them, Yahweh, who in the Old Testament is merely the “governor” of the Israelites, one of the many Jewish families.

A scholar of various ancient languages, Biglino has drawn suggestive parallels between the biblical narrative and contemporary traditions, from Egyptian to Vedic-Indian, passing through Greco-Roman culture, Homeric literature and the mysterious “biblical” traces that are so plentiful in the toponymy of the Baltic Sea.

In 2016, Biglino addressed his themes in a memorable meeting with both Christian and Jewish theologians. His position is clear. "I have never dealt with the transcendent God. I limit myself to observing that he is not present in the Bible."

His essays have been translated into English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Czech, Serbo-Croatian and Latvian. Over the past ten years, Mauro Biglino has worked tirelessly to inform and educate, disseminating his message in hundreds of conferences and participating in international conventions. Since 2020, all of his videos – viewed by millions of from all over the world – are collected on his YouTube channel: [Mauro Biglino Official Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MauroBiglinoOfficialChannel).

"Encountering Mauro Biglino’s work," he says, "is a deeply healthy, stimulating and inevitably destabilizing. It forces us to reconsider the solidity of the awareness that nourishes many of our common beliefs. And it is a testament to the courage that is needed, today more than ever, to claim the full dignity of free research."
