If you made it this far, you most likely came here to familiarize yourself with the hypothesis about which this web site justifies its existence towards the inquisitive reader. Very well, we're pleased to let you know that you set yourself out on a thought-provoking journey possibly bearing the hallmarks of a transformative experience or rather on the opposite at the very least cultivating the joy that comes with expanding ones mind with new ways of looking at old-established thought patterns. Whatever it ends up being in your case, buckle up, because you're in for a ride. A ride that takes you to the origins of civilization, to the very beginning of history in order to make the way back focussing on the most important aspects of what has happened since then up to this very day. As with all big narratives, especially the epic ones, let's stretch open the scope of this daring examination of the highest order and establish a few assumptions and considerations upon which the actual hypothesis is predicated on.

## Opening considerations

### Nothing seems impossible and yet

Astronomy is only so old. Inter-planetary space travel even younger. We seem to know everything. And yet, most of human history, we've been wrong. Let's not fall into the pitfall of bolstering too much hubris and let's be humble about our achievements in science and technology. Before the sensibly reasoned reader calls bullshit, let's remind ourselved how wrong that kind of thinking has got us in the past. Let's see for what things are, let's not claim fictional science (Sendy quote) is the same as actual scientific inquiry (Feyerabend). Whenever things seem unobstrusive, let's look at the bigger picture and go on from there.

### Life on Earth, where else

### Vastness of space

### Do we remember deep history?

### What do the scriptures say?

### Sendy's law

## Assumptions

### Life on Earth is meaningful

### Vastness of space is significant

### Scriptures and religion are deliberate

## Important aspects we should retain from here on

### Gods must have been real

- **Neo-euhemerism:** From the French néo-évhémérisme which itself is a neologism of the idea derived by the Greek philosopher Εὐήμερος (Euḗmeros). Neo-euhemerism can be understood as the speculative conjecture where the gods and people of ancient mythological lore are indeed humanoid people, in particular extraterrestrial humanoid people.
