Considering the hypothesis outlined in the previous chapter, it becomes evident that a framework of thought emerges that enables us to create a consistent portrayal of the possible origins of life on Earth. The aesthetics provided by this portrayal form the foundation of the grand narrative we put forward. This narrative depicts how sentient life on planet Earth is best explained as being another link in an interstellar chain of planetary civilizations. This idea can be seen as a revival of the concept of cosmic pluralism, which posits that the vastness of space makes it highly likely that sentient life is abundant and that this abundance makes it plausible for sentient life to exist in close proximity to Earth for a long time. Advances in space travel and genetic engineering suggest that these technologies will soon enable us to become a space-faring civilization capable of spreading life to other worlds. In the 21st century, these ideas no longer seem like mere fantasy or science fiction anymore.

While we are aware that some may accuse us of selectively choosing facts and misinterpreting speculative conclusions, we strive to be honest and transparent in our presentation of the foundations of this narrative. We believe that the emerging picture will speak for itself once fully realized.

To that effect, let us consider 4 aspects by which we're going to establish the cornerstone of the grand narrative. These four aspects can be summarized as follows:

- **Cosmic pluralism**: The notion that there's a plurality of worlds to be found within the vastness of space, each harbouring intelligent life.
- **The Tradition**: The notion that the awareness of the reality of the first aspect, namely that we're but one of many inhabited worlds, has been established on Earth throughout history. This awareness as well as the ancestral wisdom about a wide range of scientifc, technological and historical knowledge has been attempted to be safeguarded through an all-ecompassing Tradition.
- **The Truth**: The notion that the truth about our origins has not only been preserved by Earthly safeguarding known as the Tradition, but that the Gods of Old, the Heavinly Fathers, the Spacefarers, the Ones who came from the Skies have not just vanished, but have proactively interacted with our progress ever since our synthetic inception.
- **The Cycle**: The notion that intelligent life preserves itself throughout interstellar space by spreading life onto new planetary frontiers. Interstellar procreation is encoded in us so to speak and the cycle is going to be renewed in accordance with the secular movement of Precession. The entering into the Age of Aquarius bears the hallmarks of becoming aware again of what has been lost previously.
