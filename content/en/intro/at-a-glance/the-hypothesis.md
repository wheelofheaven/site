If you made it this far, you most likely came here to familiarize yourself with the hypothesis about which this web site justifies its existence towards the inquisitive reader. Very well, we're pleased to let you know that you set yourself out on a thought-provoking journey possibly bearing the hallmarks of a transformative experience or rather on the opposite at the very least cultivating the joy that comes with expanding ones mind with new ways of looking at old-established thought patterns. Whatever it ends up being in your case, buckle up, because you're in for a ride. A ride that takes you to the origins of civilization, to the very beginning of history in order to make the way back focussing on the most important aspects of what has happened since then up to this very day. As with all big narratives, especially the epic ones, let's stretch open the scope of this daring examination of the highest order and establish a few assumptions and considerations upon which the actual hypothesis is predicated on.

## Opening considerations

The idea here is to lay out a few considerations so we can slowly build up a framework of thought wherein we can properly navigate the very premises that follow therefrom. These considerations are not mere thought experiments, moreso foundational building blocks so you can properly be able to integrate the rumings upon which we can the whole narrative is based.

Perhaps, this is a good moment to mention that while we seemingly build a case bottom-up so to speak, meaning that we derive conclusions upon a set of bodies of evidence, let us be clear here, that the overall narrative will only start to make sense and be congruent enough for the few of you that stick through once you've taken in the full spectrum of aspects. The destination of the journey is known right from the outset, what's interesting to note is how can one sustain such a hypothesis. The hypothesis isn't some prospect of some adventurous-feeling sailors that promised with a royal approval to find a more favorable route which would eventually lead to shorter travel distance of valuable merchandise between hitherto and some distant land known as the Indies. No. But in the same vain as that the eventful outcome of that historical journey ultimately lead to the late rediscovery of some infamous land mass that didn't fall short of monumentally changing the status quo of what had been previously considered the very limits of their known world, the method and scope of the rumings of these lines aren't so unrelated as they may first seem. And let us recall that the world was already known to be spherical at that moment in time (yes, ellipsoidal is more accurate), and yet they collectively failed to consider the possbility of the existence of another unknown new world possibly as massive and populous as their own known old world. In our day and age, we take such factualities such as the awareness of an American continent as evident, if not even, dare I say, by the mere hubris of our own perceived intellectual superiority, obvious.

This analogy of conspicuous ignorance and sudden illumination only moments later should serve us as a reminder that there's wisdom to be found to not take our _idées reçues_ too seriously. This pattern shall not be repeated. Some humbleness in our evulation of the narrative that is up ahead would do us good. In order to not loose feet and still preserve some rationality in our way of approaching the possibility of the impossible, let's start with the proper characterization of what encompasses us all, namely the very speculative realm of space, outer space.

### Nothing seems impossible and yet

Astronomy is only so old. Inter-planetary space travel even younger. We seem to know everything. And yet, most of human history, we've been wrong. Let's not fall into the pitfall of bolstering too much hubris and let's be humble about our achievements in science and technology. Before the sensibly reasoned reader calls bullshit, let's remind ourselved how wrong that kind of thinking has got us in the past. Let's see for what things are, let's not claim fictional science (Sendy quote) is the same as actual scientific inquiry (Feyerabend). Whenever things seem unobstrusive, let's look at the bigger picture and go on from there.

### Life on Earth, where else

### Vastness of space

> The importance of the Drake Equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation. It was written not for purposes of quantification at all, but rather as the agenda for the world's first SETI meeting, in Green Bank WV in 1961. It was quite useful for its intended application, which was to summarize all the various factors which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other life.
>
> Dr. Frank Drake (from [Ask Dr. SETI | Chapter 3: Philosophy](http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm))

In the same chapter, Dr. Franke Drake goes on to say the following sentence:

> For the record, I consider the Drake Equation to be a marvelous tool for quantifying our ignorance.

### Do we remember deep history?

### What do the scriptures say?

### Sendy's law

## Assumptions

### Life on Earth is meaningful

### Vastness of space is significant

### Scriptures and religion are deliberate

## Important aspects we should retain from here on

### Gods must have been real

- **Neo-euhemerism:** From the French néo-évhémérisme which itself is a neologism of the idea derived by the Greek philosopher Εὐήμερος (Euḗmeros). Neo-euhemerism can be understood as the speculative conjecture where the gods and people of ancient mythological lore are indeed humanoid people, in particular extraterrestrial humanoid people.
