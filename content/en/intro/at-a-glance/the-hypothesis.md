If you have made it this far, it is clear that you are seeking to understand the reason for the existence of this website. We are thrilled to embark on this thought-provoking journey with you, one that may be life-altering or at the very least, provide a newfound appreciation for expanding your mind. Get ready for an adventure that takes us from the foundations of civilization, through the beginning of history and up to present day, focusing on the most crucial events that have shaped our world. As with all grand narratives, let us broaden our perspective and establish some assumptions and considerations upon which our hypothesis is based. Buckle up, you're in for a ride!

## Opening considerations

The purpose of this text is to provide a foundation for our thoughts and establish a framework for exploring the premises that follow. These considerations serve as the building blocks for a comprehensive understanding of the narrative.

Perhaps, this is a good moment to mention that while we seemingly build a case bottom-up so to speak, meaning that we derive conclusions from a set of evidence. However, the full picture will only start to make sense once you have taken in all aspects of the narrative. Our destination is already known, but the interesting part is how we sustain such a hypothesis.

The journey we embark on is not unlike the historical journey of discovering a more favorable route for trade. Just as that journey led to the rediscovery of a new world that changed the status quo, our exploration of ideas may lead to similar breakthroughs. And let us recall that the world was already known to be spherical at that moment in time (yes, ellipsoidal is more accurate), and yet they collectively failed to consider the possbility of the existence of another unknown new world possibly as massive and populous as their own known old world.

This analogy serves as a reminder to approach our established beliefs with humility and not take them too seriously. Let's start with the characterization of what encompasses us all - the speculative realm of outer space. To avoid losing our footing and maintain a rational approach to the impossible, we must maintain some level of humility in our evaluation of the narrative ahead.

### Nothing seems impossible and yet

Astronomy and particularly inter-planetary space travel are relatively new fields. Despite our growing knowledge, we must remember that human history is littered with errors and wrong assumptions. Let's approach our achievements in science and technology with humility and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence.

It's important to differentiate between fictional science and actual scientific inquiry, as noted by Feyerabend. Rather than accepting things at face value, let's broaden our perspective and consider the bigger picture. By doing so, we can avoid making the same mistakes of the past and continue advancing in our understanding of the universe.

### Life on Earth, where else

The existence of life beyond our planet is one of the biggest questions in science and one that has captivated the imagination of people for centuries. While we have yet to find definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists have been speculating for decades what would be necessary for life to exist on other planets.

One of the key requirements for life is the presence of liquid water. Water is essential for many biological processes and its presence on a planet greatly increases the likelihood of life existing there. In addition to water, a stable and hospitable environment is also crucial for the survival of life. This includes a stable temperature range, a protective atmosphere, and a consistent source of energy such as sunlight.

Another important factor is the presence of organic compounds, which are the building blocks of life. Scientists believe that these compounds could form naturally on a planet, or could be brought to a planet by comets or meteorites. Once these building blocks are present, the possible is given for life to emerge.

The presence of a suitable star is also important for life to exist on a planet. A star must be of the right type and in the right location in order to provide the necessary energy and heat for life to thrive. The star must also be stable, with a consistent luminosity and temperature over time, in order to avoid disrupting the environment of the planet.

Lastly, it is also believed that the development of intelligent life may require a series of rare and fortuitous events, possibly including the formation of a large moon to stabilize the planet's axial tilt, the presence of a large and massive planet to protect the planet from harmful impacts, and a long enough geological history to allow life to evolve and thrive.

### Vastness of space

The vastness of space is one of the main arguments in favor of the hypothesis that intelligent life must exist on other planets. With billions of observed stars and hundreds of billions of observed galaxies, the sheer scale of the universe makes it difficult to imagine that we are the only intelligent species in existence. The odds of intelligent life being present on just one planet are quite low. it makes it even more less likely when considering that we haven't yet grasped the extent of space and what may lay beyond what we have been able to observe so far.

One way to approach the question of whether intelligent life must exist on other planets is provided by the Drake equation, which is a probabilistic formula that attempts to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible. The equation takes into account various factors such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, the number of Earth-like planets per star system, and the probability that life will evolve on these planets.

Given the vast size of the universe and the number of stars and planets that exist, it is likely that there are other planets capable of sustaining life. Furthermore, the discovery of exoplanets that are similar in size and distance from their star as Earth has increased the probability of finding other planets capable of supporting life. Dr. Frank Drake, after whom the Drake Equation is named, summarizes his idea with the following words:

> The importance of the Drake Equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation. It was written not for purposes of quantification at all, but rather as the agenda for the world's first SETI meeting, in Green Bank WV in 1961. It was quite useful for its intended application, which was to summarize all the various factors which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other life.

> Dr. Frank Drake (from [Ask Dr. SETI | Chapter 3: Philosophy](http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm))

In the same chapter, Dr. Franke Drake goes on to say the following sentence:

> For the record, I consider the Drake Equation to be a marvelous tool for quantifying our ignorance.

The concept of the "cosmic haystack" further supports this hypothesis. The idea behind the cosmic haystack is that, with the vastness of space, it is possible for intelligent life to exist on other planets and still remain undetected by us. This is because the distances between stars and galaxies are so great that it would be nearly impossible for us to detect any signs of life from such a great distance.

Ultimately, the vastness of space and the numerous possibilities for life to exist make it difficult to definitively rule out the existence of intelligent life on other planets. Until we are able to directly observe or communicate with extraterrestrial life, the hypothesis that intelligent life exists on other planets will remain a compelling one.

### Do we remember deep history?

### What do the scriptures say?

### Sendy's law

## Assumptions

### Life on Earth is meaningful

### Vastness of space is significant

### Scriptures and religion are deliberate

## Important aspects we should retain from here on

### Gods must have been real

- **Neo-euhemerism:** From the French néo-évhémérisme which itself is a neologism of the idea derived by the Greek philosopher Εὐήμερος (Euḗmeros). Neo-euhemerism can be understood as the speculative conjecture where the gods and people of ancient mythological lore are indeed humanoid people, in particular extraterrestrial humanoid people.
