The hypothesis presented in here at Wheel of Heaven is deeply influenced by the Raëlian revelations, as it embraces the core message of the Elohim's role in creating life on Earth. By considering the Raëlian messages to be authentic, Wheel of Heaven proposes a more nuanced understanding of the Raëlian messages and their implications within the context of our rapidly evolving world.

In the canon of the Raëlian messages, the Elohim are an advanced extraterrestrial civilization responsible for creating life on Earth. According to this belief, the creation process occurred within a precessional cycle of less than 26,000 years, a relatively short time frame compared to the Earth's geological history.

The Raëlian messages, which are considered to be congruent and coherent, present the Elohim as beings who mastered the science of genetics and used their knowledge to engineer a diverse array of life forms on Earth, including humans. These messages are said to be encoded within ancient religious texts, particularly the Bible, wherein the Elohim are sometimes misinterpreted as "gods."

As humanity continues to develop its scientific understanding and technological capabilities, the Raëlian hypothesis suggests that we are approaching a significant turning point in our development. This involves humans becoming an interstellar civilization capable of traveling across the cosmos and seeding life on other planets. In this way, humanity would be carrying on the legacy of the Elohim and participating in a cosmic cycle of creation and propagation of life.

This transformative process mirrors the events described in the Genesis creation story, where life is brought forth on a previously barren planet. Under this scenario, humans would take on the role of the Elohim, using advanced technologies and genetic engineering to create new life forms on distant worlds. This cosmic endeavor would not only represent a significant milestone in humanity's progress but also perpetuate the cycle of life throughout the universe.
