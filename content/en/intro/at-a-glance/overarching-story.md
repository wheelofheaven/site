Considering the hypothesis outlined in the previous chapter, it becomes evident that a framework of thought emerges that enables us to create a consistent portrayal of the possible origins of life on Earth. The aesthetics provided by this portrayal form the foundation of the grand narrative we put forward. This narrative depicts how sentient life on planet Earth is best explained as being another link in an interstellar chain of planetary civilizations. This idea can be seen as a revival of the concept of cosmic pluralism, which posits that the vastness of space makes it highly likely that sentient life is abundant and that this abundance makes it plausible for sentient life to exist in close proximity to Earth for a long time. Advances in space travel and genetic engineering suggest that these technologies will soon enable us to become a space-faring civilization capable of spreading life to other worlds. In the 21st century, these ideas no longer seem like mere fantasy or science fiction anymore.

While we are aware that some may accuse us of selectively choosing facts and misinterpreting speculative conclusions, we strive to be honest and transparent in our presentation of the foundations of this narrative. We believe that the emerging picture will speak for itself once fully realized.
