If you made it to this site, you may wonder what the whole fuzz is actually about. Wheel of Heaven, a web knowledge base for a seemingly fringe hypothesis? Namely that life on Earth was and intelligently designed by an alleged extraterrestrial, interstellar civilization? The answer to that is yes. This site considers itself a repository of informations predicated on the premise that life on Earth has a deliberate purpose, that the origins of sentient life can't conclusively be attributed to the disorganized doings and the mere unwillingness of chaos and that these truths are as much encoded in scriptures and artifcats of a remote past as they are kept at least partially intact and alive in the collective experience and preservation of religious traditions.

Not only that, but Wheel of Heaven is place where such a hypothesis is upheld and laid out, but where everyone is invited to immerse him or herself in this fascinating outlook and consider the possibility of these premises to be congruent enough to elaborate further considerations upon that knowledge.

## What will you find

Before we take the plunge together, let us first tell you what you're going to be able to read on Wheel of Heaven and how the contents are structured to make the ride the smoothest possible for you. Wheel of Heaven starts of with a lenghty introduction into the narrative where all the key aspects are being highlighted and explained accordingly. There, you're gong to read about what the key premises are, how life on Earth and especially humanity took its course, and how such claims would embed themselves into our contemporary understanding and what meaning could be derived from there on. We got good news for you, if you're reading this paragraph, this means that you already found your way into this very introduction we just mentioned, namely the first part of the _At-a-glance_ chapter. You just can keep reading from here on to go along through this [Introduction]({{< ref "/intro/" >}}).

As there is only so much one can condense down into an _long enough but not as long as it could be_ introduction, Wheel of Heaven features a [Wiki]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}), a web encyclopedia where all the main domains of interest such as places, objects, people and ideas have an entry on their own. This wiki is a place where you can look up, given that the notion you're looking for has gotten an entry by then, its meaning and what more can be said about it. That's the perfect place to put things into context and where most of the information here on Wheel of Heaven is aggregated. The wiki be understood as the heart of this repository of knowledge around our esteemed hypothesis.

What is the worth of information that is not making references to other bodies of information. That's why we have a [Resources]({{< ref "/resources/" >}}) place dedicated to the curation of a set of resources. Resources here means books, websites, audiovisual media and other significant bodies of content. Go over to Resources if you want to read up some sources directly and/or if you want to get to see what the adjacent literature looks like. Some of these resources are curated by Wheel of Heaven and hosted as a free Gitbook project.

Last but not least, besides these three pillars of information, there's a [Blog]({{< ref "/articles/" >}}) that reads itself as a journal of all the thoughts and new insights that arise over time.

## Let's recap

Ok, so far so good. Let's quickly recapitulate what we came to read so far. All of the following points are main aspects of what makes up the content here on Wheel of Heaven:

- A rather complete introduction [üîó]({{< ref "/intro/" >}})
- A wiki space with lots of entries and points of interests [üîó]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}})
- A resources space with web books curated by us [üîó]({{< ref "/resources/" >}})
- A regularly updated blog where new insights and considerations are posted [üîó]({{< ref "/articles/" >}})

In closing, we at Wheel of Heaven think it is important to point out that we believe that information should be as forthcoming and transparent as possible. We are well aware how disruptive and outlandish some of the premises of this website may seem, but we strive for a smooth experience for those who are curious enought to keep reading about this fascination examniation of a possible explanation of how things may have come about.

We hope you enjoy your stay on Wheel of Heaven and even if you don't end up convinced by its premises, you may still have learned one or two pieces of information down the line. üôè
