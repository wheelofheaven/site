We start off with the Age of Capricorn first. The Age of Capricorn is the first precessional Month in the Great Year cycle. With the nominal period of 25,920 years for the precessional Year, the duration of one precessional Month is 2,190 years. During this period, the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox is aligned with the Capricorn constellation in the ecliptic.

Just as the orbital year, defined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun, is divided into 12 monthly segments, the precessional Year, also known as the Great Year, is divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months. These Great Months are based on a longer cycle called precession, which is the steady change in the orientation of the Earth's rotational axis.

To put it simply, the 25,920-year cycle is divided into 12 segments, each with a corresponding star constellation on the vernal Equinox. This makes the zodiacal houses an appropriate way to date events that span thousands of years, as they are astronomically defined and universally understandable.

While the choice of starting the Timeline with the Age of Capricorn may seem arbitrary, it will become clearer as we explore the reasons behind this decision in a visual tutorial. For now, keep in mind that this choice is just a starting point in the greater understanding of the narrative.

## Once upon a time in Capricorn

Have you watched the classic film series Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg? We will be using the movie's premise and fictional setting as a starting point for our journey of space explorers, planet terraformers, and life creators. The first movie introduces us to wealthy and successful entrepreneur John Hammond and his team of brilliant scientists, who use cloning and genetic engineering to bring dinosaurs back to life. According to the movie, prehistoric mosquitos trapped in un-fossilized amber still contain the partially intact blood of some reptiles, which serves as the basis for DNA extraction. To complete the DNA, the gaps are filled with frog DNA through a speculative process. With this, the scientists are able to revive the long-extinct dinosaurs, which are showcased in a theme park on a Central American island, attracting visitors from all over the world.

However, things go wrong when the dinosaurs break free and create chaos, but the main characters manage to survive against all odds and are rescued by an extraction team at the end of the movie, a pattern that continues in the series. The film series is known for its skeptical view of scientific progress and human hubris, inspired by Michael Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name.

Here's the connection: According to the Wheel of Heaven hypothesis, based on the revelations made by Yahweh to Raël, what happened at the start of the Age of Capricorn could have been taken straight from the pages of Jurassic Park: In this scenario, a group of visionary scientists create a new and potentially dangerous species through genetic engineering, which ultimately leads to a catastrophic outcome and endangers their research.

## 22'000 years ago

Obviously, Jurassic Parc is fictional and no research institution has been in the news for having synthetized an extinct or even a new species of life lately. The events that we're about to discuss are to be situated in a totally different day and age.

As we pointed out in the previous chapter [Overarching Story # The Truth]({{< relref "intro/at-a-glance/overarching-story.md#the-truth" >}}), we acknowledge the narrative put forward in the three founding books of Räelism as canonical. These books document a series of series of encounters between Yahweh, the head representative of a Heavenly extraterrestrial council of Eternals, that were mistaken for Gods over the ages, and a Frenchman. This council of Eternals is best considered a governing body of an extraterrestrial civilization we commonly remember as the Elohim. The aforementioned Frenchman, who was given the name Ra-el designating his role as an Earthly ambassador, went on to form a new religious movement, Raëlism[^1]. One of the main goals of the newly found movement is to preserve, translate and propagate the messages entrusted by Yahweh to all receptive ears. In these messages, Yahweh demystifies the notion of God, revises the meaning of religion and recounts an in-depth retelling of the Biblical Genesis creation narrative.

In one of these retellings, Yahweh gives a significant chronological clue to situate the beginning of their arrival on planet Earth:

> Some 22,000 years ago, your creators decided to start their work on Earth, and everything that has happened since was anticipated because the movement of the galaxy implies this knowledge.

This puts us right at in between the years of –21'810 and –19'650, the range of years that make up the Age of Capricorn. The Elohim allegedly came to Earth and started their work thereon. While the precessional wobble of the Earthly axis is not unique to this planet, the duration and the effect it has on the observable night sky is. As much as an Earhtly day or an Earthly year are unique characteristics of our planet, the precessional World Ages as much of a unique characteristic.

Therefore, the moment of arrival of an extraterrestrial civilization to a planet devoid of life would mark the beginning of having an intelligent entity being capable of observing astral phenomenons as seen from planet Earth. Along the twelve World Ages, the Age of Capricorn starting in –21'810 would make an appropriate starting point of the overall chronology put forward here on Wheel of Heaven.

Moreover, in ordinray or popular astrology, the astrological sign of Capricorn is thought to last from 22nd of December to 19th of January[^2]. In the Gregorian calender, the New Year's Day falls on the 1st of January. This makes both the precession induced Age of Capricorn as well as the ordinary astrological sign Capricorn symbols of start and end of a longer cycle. What an interesting coincidence that deserves more pondering.  To recap, the Age of Capricorn is best considered to be the precessional January, starting in –21'810, where a full precessional year, the Great Year takes full 25'920 years. The Age of Capricorn presently marking the arrival of the Elohim on planet Earth.

[^1]: The letter _ë_ is relict from the French language, in which the diaresis that indicates that the _ë_ is to be pronounced separately from the preceding vowel, rendering the morpheme _raël_ to be correctly pronounced as pronounced in the name Raphael.
[^2]: The name of the first month of the year, January, goes back to the Roman god gateways and beginnings, Janus. The etymology of Janus, or as written in Latin Iānus literally meaning "arched passage" or "doorway", ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European *ieh₂nu "passage".

## On a distant planet

The narrative as recorded during the encounters between Raël and Yahweh is for the most part a commentary on the Biblical scriptures. In an exegetical manner[^3], Yahweh recollects what happened in the beginning, during Genesis[^4]. However, before he starts commenting on the Biblical passages, he establishes a prologue to the events described in Genesis. That prologue brings us back to Jurassic Park.

The story of the Elohim evidently doesn't start on planet Earth. They originate from another planet, an Elohimian home planet. Yahweh starts off the story with remembering what preceded the events Genesis and eventually lead to them:

> A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.
>
> The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people. [...]

The parallels with the Jurassic Park lore is staggering. We note that some 24'000 years ago, on a distant planet, the Elohimian home planet, its inhabitants managed to develop a civilization capable of artifical gene synthesis _de novo_[^5]. These advancements of genetic engineering lead them to synthetically engineer new life forms. Ulimately, that branch of research of synthetic life engineering ended in a fateful casuality where some of these synthetically created animals broke loose and did kill many people.

We must imagine how a civilization similar to ours, even if slightly more advanced and developed, would react to experimental research like that. Especially considering that the concerns voiced by an eminent faction among the populace, deeming that kind of research to be distateful, objectionable and most importantly dangerous proved to be appropriate. In our day and age, abundant with controversies and mistrust towards executive and leading institutions, a research project of the same magnitude, if it were to become a public matter, would most likely provoke a similar amount of criticism and politicization. The very popularity of the Jurassic Park franchise is a telling indicator on how arguments would be made.

The franchise explores the dangers of playing God through the use of genetic engineering to bring extinct species back to life. In the first Jurassic Park movie for instance, the character Dr. Ian Malcolm warns of the dangers of genetic engineering and the risks of creating genetically modified organisms that can potentially escape and wreak havoc on the world. He argues that the scientists behind the creation of the park were so preoccupied with whether or not they could create dinosaurs, they never stopped to think if they should.

The subsequent films in the franchise also continue to explore the consequences of genetic engineering, such as the development of hybrid dinosaurs with unpredictable and dangerous behaviors. Through these themes, the Jurassic Park franchise critiques the potential for science to be used for destructive purposes and emphasizes the importance of responsible scientific research and development.

What happened after these _monsters_ broke free? The second part of the prologue as recounted by Yahweh finished with the following sentence:

> [...] Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments.

This brings us back to Jurassic Park lore once more. In the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park movies, Jurassic World (2015), the female lead character Claire Dearing mentions the possibility of the space program being as profitable as dinosaur-based theme parks. Although the movie is fictional, this detail is intriguing. The writers suggests that in a society as advanced as the one depicted in the film, genetic engineering and space travel could potentially develop concurrently.

Apparently, this concurrency did happen for the Elohimian civilization. Considering our own pace of scientific and technological progress of the past few decades, it isn't too much of a stretch to imagine that a sophisticated state of genetic engineering capabilities, where life synthetization is possible, coincides with interplanetary and interstellar space travel capabilities in terms of civilizational progress. It is also reasonable to assume that a civilization like ours that just entered the age of space travel wouldn't have fully overcome resource and energy scarcity. While such a civilization must be thriving and abundant in problem solving technologies and research, it would also be likely to incentivize and foster progress through a credit system. The point being that genetic engineering and space travel as industries and fields of research must be very lucrative and highly incentivized in such a civilization that just made the technological leap of creating the means to travel in space and create new life from scratch.

The consistency of the narrative allegedly put forward by Yahweh himself is in the realm of the conceivable. While in our day and age, we clearly haven't achieved nor mastered in the least any of these leaps in technology, these things cannot be considered fictional anymore, but almost seem in reach. Only 50 years ago, when these revelations were made to Raël, the Apollo program just came to put men on the moon and James Watson Francis Crick discovered the double helix structure of the DNA two decades before that. Science and especially applied science has come a long way since, what used to be science-fiction only 50 years ago became reality. Let's just consider for a minute what is possible in the next 50 years, let alone 100 years from now on...

## To Earth

The prologue doesn't end there. After the genetic experiments became polemic and consequently were halted therefrom on the Elohimian home planet, space exploration lead to new interplanetary and interstellar frontiers. A complete new class of possibilities opened for them.

Right after the aforementioned passage, Yahweh goes on and adds what ties us to them:

> They chose Earth where you live.

Earth, a barren but material planet devoid of life proved to be the frontier they were looking for. Who is _they_ though? The Raëlian canon does offer partial answers to this question. At this stage of the narration however, some speculations from our part on the nature of that explorative mission gives us a better understanding of the conditions in which these events evolved in.

[^3]: The practice of exegesis equates to critically explain or interpret a religious text. In simple terms, exegesis refers to the process of discovering the original and intended meaning of a passage of scripture. This is precisely what Yahweh does as described in the foundational works of Raëlism. Yahweh comments on Biblical passages and explains how these passages should be understood.
[^4]: The Biblical Book of Genesis is called Bereshith (בְּרֵאשִׁית) in the Hebraic Torah, literally meaning "in the beginning" in Hebrew. This is because in the Hewbrew Bible, books are named using incipits. The first words in first book of the Hebrew Bible is Bereshit ("In the beginning ...").

[^5]: De novo gene synthesis is a process where a DNA sequence is artificially created from scratch, without the need for an existing DNA template. Essentially, it is like writing a new genetic code from scratch. See more: [De novo synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis)
