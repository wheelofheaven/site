We start off with the Age of Capricorn first. The Age of Capricorn is the first precessional Month in the Great Year cycle. With the nominal period of 25'920 years for the precessional Year, the duration of one precessional Month is 2'190 years. During this period, the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox is aligned with the Capricorn constellation in the ecliptic.

Just as the orbital year, defined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun, is divided into 12 monthly segments, the precessional Year, also known as the Great Year, is divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months. These Great Months are based on a longer cycle called precession, which is the steady change in the orientation of the Earth's rotational axis.

To put it simply, the 25,920-year cycle is divided into 12 segments, each with a corresponding star constellation on the vernal Equinox. This makes the zodiacal houses an appropriate way to date events that span thousands of years, as they are astronomically defined and universally understandable.

While the choice of starting the Timeline with the Age of Capricorn may seem arbitrary, the reasons behind this decision are elaborated in the previous chapter, [Preamble # The Truth]({{< relref "intro/timeline/preamble.md#once-upon-a-time" >}}). In the previous chapter, we also learned that right at the onset of the Capricornian Age, the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, arrived on Earth. Motivated by a tragic incident involving the escape of one of their genetic experiments, which resulted in the loss of Elohimian lifes and the cessation of that branch of research on their home planet, the Elohim sought new interstellar frontiers. Pursuing interplanetary and interstellar exploration, the researchers eventually chose Earth, an exoplanet, as their frontier for genetic research.

## Traces of truth

Yahweh says:

> Now I would like you to refer to the Bible where you will find traces of the truth about your past. These traces, of course, have been somewhat distorted by successive transcribers who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described
as being a mystical and supernatural force.

And then:

> Only the parts of the Bible that I will translate are important. Other parts are merely poetic babblings of which I will say nothing. I am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences.

## Genesis

> So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:
>
>> In the beginning Elohim<sup>1</sup>created the heaven and the earth.
>> Genesis 1: 1.
>
> Elohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew “those who came from the sky”, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. [...]

and then

> [...] They “created”, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.

## Blue planet

>> And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.
>> Genesis 1: 2.
>
> This means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.

## Solar radiation

>> And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.
>> Genesis 1: 4.
>
> To create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth’s surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the “light was good”.

## First day of Genesis

>> And the evening and the morning were the first day.
>> Genesis 1: 5.
>
> This research took quite some time. The “day” mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.



## A quick recap

The Age of Capricorn is one of the twelve World Ages and lasted from from –21'810 to up –19'650 and lasted as each World Age 2'160 years.

After the Age of Capricorn (from –21'810 to –19'650) comes the Age of Sagittarius (from –19'650 to –17'490).
