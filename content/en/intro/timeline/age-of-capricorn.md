The Age of Capricon is the first house that we're going to look at. Using the nominal period of 25'920 years for the precessional Year, we can determine the duration of one precessional Month to be exactly 2'190 years. That is the period of time durng which the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox faces a given Zodiacal house on the ecliptic. The Age of Capricorn is therefore the precessional Month or the period of time during which the Sun rises in the Zodiacal image of the Capricorn constellation in its background during Spring Equinox.

As with the orbital year defined by the Earth's revolution around it's central star, the Sun, which we deliberately divide into 12 segments (which in turn are derived from the orbital period of the Moon), so-called months, the precessional Year, the Great Year is also divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months. We call them Great because they're based on a larger and longer cycle than to what we're used to with the orbital year which takes some 365 days to resolve. That Great cycle is called Precession and is based on the steady change of the orientation of the rotational axis of our planet Earth. If you happen to have been unfamiliar with these astronomical concepts, don't worry, we are well aware that's a lot to take in. We're going to write a visual tutorial on the subject as we deem that this is an important key piece to the overall understanding of the narrative.

To quickly recapitulate, there's a 25'920 year long cycle that is divided into 12 segments that is each housing a corresponding star constellation in its backdrop on the vernal Equinox. So if we wanted to properly date things that last longer than 1000 of years, then these zodiacal houses seem not only appropriate, but would be astronomically defined from the point of view of our planet Earth which makes them universally understandable. Now, for some unknown reason we start off the Timeline with the Age of Capricorn. Choosing this specific Age of Capricorn may seem arbitrary which fairly enough it is quite arbritrary ultimately, but bear with us as the reasons why we chose the Age of Capricorn as our precessional January will eventually reveal itself.

## Once upon a time in Capricorn

Have you ever seen Steven Spielberg's cult classic _Jurassic Park_ or any of its derivates in terms of movies? We'll be using the movie series' premise and its fictional setting to start off this epic journey of star travellers, world terraformers and life inceptioners. The very first movie presents us with a wealth and seemingly successful entrepreneur John Hammond who together with a team of ingenious scientists pioneers de-extinct dinosaurs through a combination of cloning and genetic engineering. Prehistoric mosquitos, so makes us the movie believe, trapped in unfossilized amber that still contain the partially intact blood of some reptiles serve as the basis for DNA extraction. The extracted DNA, slightly damaged and thus incomplete, get its gaps filled with frog DNA. In some highly speculative process, these fictional scientists managed to overcome all the obstacles and auspiciously revive long-extinct dinosaurs which are showcased in a theme park on the shores of a Central American island welcoming tourists and visitors from all over the world to come see these fearsome creatures from a time past.

As with all suspensful movies, things go wrong, awfully wrong and several of these dinosaurs break free and create havoc whereever they go. The main protagonists somehow manage to stay alive and spectacularly emerge unharmed in each perilous encounter with one of the carnivorous species against all the odds. As the lone survivors, they get rescued by a dedicated extraction team at the end of the movie, a pattern that will remain a stable in the movie series' legacy (that counts 6 movies as of the time of the writing).

The movie and its subsequent entries are known to have a skeptical stance towards scientific progress and the human hubris. This is no wonder as the movie is based on a 1990 novel of the same name written by a certain Michael Crichton.

Here's the catch: What happened in the beginning of the Age of Capricorn could have been taken straight out of _Jurassic Park_.

## On a distant planet

Yahweh goes on and says:

> A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.'
>
> The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.
>
> Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments.

In the 4rd movie installment of the Jurassic Park's franchise, _Jurassic World_ (2015), the lead female protagonist Claire Dearing mentions that another business venue supposedly as profitable as the dinosaur based theme parks is the space program. While the movie is purely fictional, this is an interesting detail. The story writers seem to agree that within the imaginary setting depicting a similary advanced society to ours it can be concluded congruent enough to assume that the development of genetic engineering can coincide with the development of space travel. One may be inclined to interject that the two premises are evidently square and must happen at the same time. Fair enough, but let us remind you that this sort of reasoning falls under the category of bias that come from historical myopia, or the tendency to forget how things used to be only a few decades ago.

Right after the aforementioned passage, Yahweh goes on and adds:

> They chose Earth where you live.
