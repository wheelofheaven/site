We start off with the Age of Capricorn first. The Age of Capricorn is the first precessional Month in the Great Year cycle. With the nominal period of 25,920 years for the precessional Year, the duration of one precessional Month is 2,190 years. During this period, the rising Sun on the Vernal Equinox is aligned with the Capricorn constellation in the ecliptic.

Just as the orbital year, defined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun, is divided into 12 monthly segments, the precessional Year, also known as the Great Year, is divided into 12 precessional Months, or Great Months. These Great Months are based on a longer cycle called precession, which is the steady change in the orientation of the Earth's rotational axis.

To put it simply, the 25,920-year cycle is divided into 12 segments, each with a corresponding star constellation on the vernal Equinox. This makes the zodiacal houses an appropriate way to date events that span thousands of years, as they are astronomically defined and universally understandable.

While the choice of starting the Timeline with the Age of Capricorn may seem arbitrary, it will become clearer as we explore the reasons behind this decision in a visual tutorial. For now, keep in mind that this choice is just a starting point in the greater understanding of the narrative.

## Once upon a time in Capricorn

Have you watched the classic film series Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg? We will be using the movie's premise and fictional setting as a starting point for our journey of space explorers, planet terraformers, and life creators. The first movie introduces us to wealthy and successful entrepreneur John Hammond and his team of brilliant scientists, who use cloning and genetic engineering to bring dinosaurs back to life. According to the movie, prehistoric mosquitos trapped in un-fossilized amber still contain the partially intact blood of some reptiles, which serves as the basis for DNA extraction. To complete the DNA, the gaps are filled with frog DNA through a speculative process. With this, the scientists are able to revive the long-extinct dinosaurs, which are showcased in a theme park on a Central American island, attracting visitors from all over the world.

However, things go wrong when the dinosaurs break free and create chaos, but the main characters manage to survive against all odds and are rescued by an extraction team at the end of the movie, a pattern that continues in the series. The film series is known for its skeptical view of scientific progress and human hubris, inspired by Michael Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name.

Here's the connection: What happened at the start of the Age of Capricorn could have been taken straight from the pages of Jurassic Park.

## Once upon a time

> Some 22,000 years ago, your creators decided to start their work on Earth, and everything that has happened since was anticipated because the movement of the galaxy implies this knowledge.

## On a distant planet

Yahweh goes on and says:

> A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.
>
> The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.
>
> Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments.

In the 4rd movie installment of the Jurassic Park's franchise, _Jurassic World_ (2015), the lead female protagonist Claire Dearing mentions that another business venue supposedly as profitable as the dinosaur based theme parks is the space program. While the movie is purely fictional, this is an interesting detail. The story writers seem to agree that within the imaginary setting depicting a similary advanced society to ours it can be concluded congruent enough to assume that the development of genetic engineering can coincide with the development of space travel. One may be inclined to interject that the two premises are evidently square and must happen at the same time. Fair enough, but let us remind you that this sort of reasoning falls under the category of bias that come from historical myopia, or the tendency to forget how things used to be only a few decades ago.

Right after the aforementioned passage, Yahweh goes on and adds:

> They chose Earth where you live.
