## Peace in Heaven

> The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.

The exiled creators who were fighting/resisting their home planet's authority was pardoned and could return back to their home world again.

## Sodom and Gomorrah

> But among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them.

Mission of revenge

> Consequently, the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on:
>
>> And there came two angels to Sodom at even 3. Genesis 19: 1.

Espionage

> Some humans tried to kill them, but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon:
>
>> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great. Genesis 19: 11.

Counter-espionage

> They warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:
>
>> Up, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city. Genesis 19: 14
>
> As the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.
>
>> Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. Genesis 19: 17.

The plan was to annihilate the two cities of the plain

> And the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:
>
>> Then Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. Genesis 19: 24-26.
>
> As you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.

Sodom and Gomorrah were annihilated

## Abraham

> Later, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them.

Checking in

> This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.
>
>> Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. Genesis 22: 12.

Abraham was identified as one of these leaders of Israel

## Regression

> Because of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:
>
>> Put away the foreign gods that are among you. Genesis 35: 2.
