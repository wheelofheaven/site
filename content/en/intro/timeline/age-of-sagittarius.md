The Age of Sagittarius lasts from –19'650 to –17'490 and follows the Age of Sagittarius which lasted up to –19'650. In the previous chapter, we learned that during the period of the Age of Sagittarius, the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, arrived on Earth. Motivated by a tragic incident involving the escape of one of their genetic experiments, which resulted in the loss of Elohimian lifes and the cessation of that branch of research on their home planet, the Elohim sought new interstellar frontiers. Pursuing interplanetary and interstellar exploration, the researchers eventually chose Earth, an exoplanet, as their frontier for genetic research.

The events that follow their arrival on planet Earth seamlessly lead into the Sagittarian Age.

## Traces of truth

Yahweh says:

> Now I would like you to refer to the Bible where you will find traces of the truth about your past. These traces, of course, have been somewhat distorted by successive transcribers who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described
as being a mystical and supernatural force.

And then:

> Only the parts of the Bible that I will translate are important. Other parts are merely poetic babblings of which I will say nothing. I am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences.

## Genesis

> So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:
>
>> In the beginning Elohim<sup>1</sup>created the heaven and the earth.
>> Genesis 1: 1.
>
> Elohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew “those who came from the sky”, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. [...]

and then

> [...] They “created”, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.

## Blue planet

>> And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.
>> Genesis 1: 2.
>
> This means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.

## Solar radiation

>> And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.
>> Genesis 1: 4.
>
> To create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth’s surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the “light was good”.

## First day of Genesis

>> And the evening and the morning were the first day.
>> Genesis 1: 5.
>
> This research took quite some time. The “day” mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.

## A quick recap
