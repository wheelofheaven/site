## Terraforming Earth

>> And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.
>> Genesis 1: 7.
>
> After studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, “the waters which were above the firmament”, and the ocean covering the whole planet, “the waters which were under the firmament”. Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear. Genesis 1: 9.

## Pangeae

>> Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.
>> Genesis 1: 9.
>
> After they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere. So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent.
