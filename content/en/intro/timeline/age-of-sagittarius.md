The Age of Sagittarius lasts from –19'650 to –17'490 and follows the Age of Capricorn which lasted up to –19'650.

In the last chapter, The Age of Capricorn, we learned that a group of scientifically inclined spacefaring pioneers managed to find an exoplanet that all elements necessary to produce artifical life, including water. The planet they've found was covered in water and mist, and didn't harbour any life at the moment of its discovery. They went on to build a network of artifical satellites to study the planet. They themselves were orbiting the planet in a what we would call a space station while studying and evaluating the data they were gathering while doing so.Eventually, the data started to become clear in answering the question whether or not the planet would be able to support life and they decided to go on with their work.

All of that happened during the Age of Capricorn which lasted from –21'810 to –19'650, that one of the twelve precessional World Ages. Another appellation of that period of time, that is known through the Biblical scriptures, is the First Day of Creation. The discovery and subsequent studies of that new exoplanetary world is indeed to be equated with what is being described in the first book of Genesis: _"And Elohim saw the light, that it was good."_

As the planet Earth was deemed _good_, meaning it not only had all the elements necessary to bear new life, but was also favorable in a series of other, equally important aspects, the second phase begun. The Second Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Sagittarius.

## Terraforming Earth

In the first book out of the three foundational works of Raëlism, The Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh continues the exegetical interpretation of the Biblical verses.

>> And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.
>> Genesis 1: 7.
>
> After studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, “the waters which were above the firmament”, and the ocean covering the whole planet, “the waters which were under the firmament”.

According to Yahweh's explanation, this excerpt describes how the scientifical pioneers went on to study cosmic rays above the clouds, and then went below the clouds but remained above the ocean. This literally means they were between the "waters above the firmament" (the clouds) and the "waters below the firmament" (the ocean).

## Pangeae

>> Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.
>> Genesis 1: 9.
>
> After they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere. So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent.
