The Age of Gemini lasts from –6'690 to –4'530 and follows the Age of Cancer which lasted up to –6'690.

From the perspective of Genesis and its seven Days of Creation, the Age of Gemini would represent the Eight Day. The number eight is encoded in the amount of people entering Noah's Ark: Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives, a total of 8 people.

## The Decision

>> And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Genesis 6: 5.
>
> The “evil” in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being “good”, as far as those on the Elohim’s planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their “evil” was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.

What happened on Earth was deemed too dangerous to the authorities on the Elohimian home planet.

## The Preservation Project

> The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled
creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.
>
> This was true figuratively speaking, but in reality - and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this - a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.

Noah's Ark - a spacecraft meant to preserve genetic material

> The spacecraft had three sections:
>
>> ...and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. Genesis 6: 16.

The spacecraft had multiple sections

## The Great Flood

> When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.

Global mass-extinction cataclysm

>> The ark... was lift up above the earth. Genesis 7: 17.
>
> As you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted “above” the Earth and not “on” the water.

The preservational spacecraft managed to escape in time

There are reasons to believe that the Great Flood happened around 6'000 BC when the Sun was rising in the house of Gemini during the vernal equinox, aligning with Castor, one of the majors star (which actually consists of multiple stars) of the constellation.

## Reset

> Then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:
>
>> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. Genesis 7: 24.

Radioactive fallout

> Later it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.
>
>> And Elohim remembered Noah... and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged. Genesis 8: 1.

The spacecraft landed on dry land

## Reseeding

> After monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:
>
>> And Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
>> Genesis 8: 20.

Humans were thankful.

> The creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.
>
>> ...for the imagination of man’s heart is evil.
>> Genesis 8: 21.

Having safeguarded life was good.

> The goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.
>
>> And by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
>> Genesis 10: 32.

## The Tower of Babel

> But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators’ planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket - The Tower of Babel.
>
>> And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Genesis 11: 6.

The rocket to reach the heavens

> The people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this. They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.
>
>> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. Genesis 11: 7-8.

The Elohiman home planet took notice

> So they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.

Preventive action

## War in Heaven

> To avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.
>
>> In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. Isaiah 27: 1.

The creators during that span of time hid themselves in the oceans.

> At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.

This is a small but crucial sentence in the Raëlian canon, not to be mentioned again. The infamous myths about a pantheon of younger Gods fighting another pantheon of older Gods fully comes to fruition here, the so called "Theomachy".

## A quick recap
