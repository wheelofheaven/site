## Animal kingdom

>> Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind.
>> Genesis 1: 24.
> 
> After marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.

> It was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making “test tube children” who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.

## Homo genesis

>> Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the<S-Del>  air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
>> Genesis 1: 26.

> “In our image!” You can see that the resemblance is striking. That is when the trouble started for us.
