The first efforts to develop and maintain this website have started last year around the autumn equinox while I was sitting in the rooftop bar of my stay in Jerusalem overlooking the Old City in the east. A lot has happened since and the amount of content has skyrocketed. A lot of attention was paid to the userability of the web presence and also the wiki has been fleshed out as much as humanily possible by only one maintainer (I hope my efforts will know some increased interested so more people can lend out their skills and knowledge).

Something I'd like to report about is indeed what is being planned where the website should head towards to in the future. I always had a nag for the encyclopedic layout when it comes to how information should be made accesible. Information is best served when full transparency is provided on where the various pieces of information have been sources from. That way, the reader is given the ability to assess for him or herself how useful new information that brought this his or her attention is. This was and is one of the key driving incentives of creating this website and structure its contents the way they are being provided for as of now (intro, wiki, resources, etc.).

## 236'000 parasangs

I am mentioning this, because very recently, I was looking up a well-known and mysterious [passage](https://wheelofheaven.github.io/rael-one-the-book-which-tells-the-truth/5-the-end-of-the-world.html) from the RaÃ«lian canon, namely where the canonicity of the Jewish Kabbalah was confirmed and a quote was provided which shows that the Kabbalah makes references to astronomical measurements, therefore implying that the scriptures are indeed alluding to being from a different solar system.

> 'It is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.
>
> If one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. Particularly noteworthy is a description in the Canticle of Canticles (5) of the creators' planet and the distance which separates it from Earth.
>
> It is written that the "height of the creator" is 236,000 "parasangs", and that "the height of his heels" is 30,000,000 "parasangs".

This lead me to an [article](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/shi-x0027-ur-komah), also written in an encyclopedic format, named "Shiâ€™ur Qomah" (Hebrew ×©×™×¢×•×¨ ×§×•×ž×” for the measure of the body [of god]) on the Jewish Virtual Library. Therein, the height of the Creator is given as 236'000 parasangs, the number itself being based on a numerological interpretation from another Biblical passage, Psalm 147:5. There I had found my first clue this highly specific number had indeed been part of the Jewish Biblical exegesis and that the reference was obscure enough to acknowledge the unlikelihood of some uninitiated outsider (RaÃ«l) to have randomly picked up the signifance to weave together a new religious narrative out of nowhere. Ultimately, this route of research led to a large body of insights I will share here on Wheel of Heaven at a later point in time, once I have compiled it all together and written down my train of thought.

What was more interesting actually, and that's where we join together where Wheel of Heaven as a whole should be heading towards to in the future is the website that the Jewish Virtual Library was linking to when it came to its Biblical passages. These links resolved to a website I was up to that point totally unaware of, the name of that website is Sefaria. Now, let me tell you one or two things about Sefaria.

## Sefaria in a nutshell

Sefaria ([www.sefaria.org](https://www.sefaria.org)) is a free online platform that offers an extensive collection of Jewish texts, both in their original languages and in translation. It stands out for its interlinked structure, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between primary texts and their commentaries. Beyond just being a repository, Sefaria encourages interactive learning. Users can annotate texts, create thematic source sheets, and even contribute translations. With its open-source model and a commitment to community engagement, Sefaria serves as a digital hub for Jewish scholarship, making it an invaluable resource for anyone delving into Jewish studies.

It got founded in 2011 by journalist Joshua Foer and Brett Lockspeiser, a former Google project manager. Envisioned as a "living library of Jewish texts," the platform is open-source and relies on volunteers to contribute texts and translations. It offers a unique interconnected structure, linking various texts and providing them in their original languages, such as Hebrew, Aramaic, and Judeo-Arabic, alongside translations. Beyond its vast collection, Sefaria offers tools for users to create source sheets. The platform is overseen by a non-profit organization, employing a team of 18 engineers. By 2019, it attracted 250,000 unique visitors each month. The name "Sefaria" is inspired by the Hebrew words for "book" (sefer) and "library" (sifria). Over the years, Sefaria has expanded its offerings, including a major redesign in 2016, the release of significant texts like the William Davidson Talmud in 2017, and a pilot program in 2020 to incorporate secular works.

It is precisely the last part that was so inspiring for me to consider, namely that this style of providing information can obviously be applied to any body of knowledge. In a way, the purpose of Wheel of Heaven is very similar in its goal-setting and tries to achieve to make a body of information as accessible as possible. Perhaps, cynics could argue that Sefaria at least is doing this for a valid field of research, Jewish scriptures, and Wheel of Heaven taps more into pseudoscientific realms, but in my opinion, this is secondary as what matters is that information independent of apparent value should always be provided in a transparent and traceable way.
