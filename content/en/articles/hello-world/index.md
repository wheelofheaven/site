Hello World! Wheel of Heaven has been launched offically! Wheel of Heaven is a knowledge base exploring the working theory that life on Earth was intelligently designed by an extraterrestrial civilization, the so-called Elohim.

While the working theory is not necessarily something new and there are a certain number of forethinkers within the realm of ancient astronauts, creationism and/or an neo-euhemeristic reading of ancient mythology, the foundation upon which the premises are residing is an unapologetic re-interpretation RaÃ«lism, a new religious movement that goes back to a Frenchman that avowedly met the representative of an extraterrestrial civilization, Yahweh, that left us with an important message of very deep philsophical implications if proven true. Fundamental questions of the nature of "Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?" are going to be answered here on Wheel of Heaven.

As with all big narratives, we at Wheel of Heaven, are well aware that this is only one of many. We don't claim to have the absolute definitive answers to everything, but we're eager to explore what can be deduced from these RaÃ«lian premises and where that would leave us if they end up turning out to be true. This knowledge base therefore tries to canonize, to contextualize and to foster reasearch around the very premise of RaÃ«lism, which can be summed up to notion of extraterrestrial or scientific intelligent design.

We hope that you stick around and help us to get to the bottom of this very fascinating working theory! Please note, that we're only so many that are keeping up with writing up the contents that you find over here, but be assured that we're very dedicated in delivering, slowly but surely, the most extensive body of research to you the curious reader. With that in mind, feel welcome to ask questions and make this endeavour even more worthwhile.
