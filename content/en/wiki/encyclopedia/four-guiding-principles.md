## The four principles

The philosophy put forward by Raëlism, a new religious movement that goes back to founder Claude Vorhilon, widely known as Raël, is profoundly marked by its interpretation of humanity's origins and destiny. In the second book of the Raëlian canon titled "Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet", Raël, through the alleged revelations by Yahweh, elucidates the ethical guidelines for individuals who seek enlightenment within the confines of this movement. These principles could be summarized and coined as the "Principles of alignement with infinity".

1. **Principle of Infinite Orientation**: The first principle encourages one to maintain an expansive perspective by continuously reflecting on the notion of infinity. As he states, "the most important level is that relating to infinity, for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged". In this context, the universe's limitless nature should be used as a yardstick to gauge actions and decisions. This infinite orientation underscores the idea that individuals are part of a broader cosmic fabric that surpasses human comprehension. It promotes an altruistic ethos, urging individuals to consider others as integral parts of the infinite tapestry of existence.

2. **Principle of Creators Alignment**: A core tenet of the Raëlian belief system are the Elohim, the extraterrestrial beings who they believe have created life on Earth, in particular humanity and were mistaken for Gods and still are remembered as such. They consider these entities as their spiritual parents, worthy of reverence and emulation. According to this principle, one should always take into account the advice of these creators, acting in a way that human society listens and follows their guidance.

3. **Principle of Societal Questioning**: Within this framework of thought, society is considered both an enabler and an inhibitor of technological, but also spiritual development. While it can provide a conducive environment for the realization of truth, it is believed society often stifles spiritual progress. Consequently, the third principle encourages one to challenge societal norms, laws, and traditions, seeing these elements as potential shackles imprisoning human minds in obscurantism.

4. **Principle of Individual Fulfillment**: Finally, the fourth and last principle emphasizes the importance of personal fulfillment, which is perceived as an essential prerequisite to achieving alignment with infinity and subsequently transforming into an evolved being. Without self-fulfillment, one cannot achieve harmony with the infinite and fully realize one's spiritual potential.

These Principles of Infinity Alignment encourage a complex interplay of introspection, reverence for the divine, societal questioning, and pursuit of personal fulfillment. The implications are manifold. In a world marked by fragmentation and division, the first principle advocates a broader perspective, promoting unity and empathy. The second principle brings a sense of spirituality and reverence, creating a moral compass guided by the wisdom of the Elohim. The third principle fosters critical thinking and resistance to blind conformity, thereby cultivating societal evolution. Lastly, the principle of individual fulfillment emphasizes personal growth, pushing for the development of an enlightened, self-actualized individual.

## Cosmic existentialism

The Four Guiding Principles of the Raëlian philosophy could be seen as part of an emerging category within contemporary philosophical discourse: Cosmic Existentialism.

Cosmic Existentialism takes cues from classical Existentialism, such as the emphasis on individual freedom, authenticity, and responsibility, while incorporating elements of Cosmology and Metaphysics. It offers a philosophical perspective grounded in an awareness of humanity's place within the cosmos and our relation to infinity. The Raëlian principles echo this perspective, with the Principle of Infinite Orientation encouraging a cosmological awareness, and the Principle of Individual Fulfillment emphasizing personal growth and self-actualization within this cosmic context.

This new philosophical category also accounts for the synthesis of ethics and extraterrestrial reverence seen in the Raëlian movement. While Ethics as a discipline explores moral values, Cosmic Existentialism extends this to consider the ethical implications of our position within the universe and potential interactions with extraterrestrial beings or entities. The Principle of Creator Alignment, with its reverence towards the Elohim, exemplifies this unique ethical perspective.

The Principle of Societal Questioning, while rooted in social philosophy and existentialist thought, adds another layer to this cosmic philosophical stance. It emphasizes the dynamic, evolving nature of society in response to our understanding of our cosmic place and the wisdom received from extraterrestrial creators.
