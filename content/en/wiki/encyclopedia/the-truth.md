description: "The Truth, the speculative notion that when enough tokens of partial truths are suitably demystified and compiled together, a cohesive all-encompassing narrative emerges that tells the chronicles of how life on Earth was engineered by an extraterrestrial civilization and of what followed thereafter up to this very day where this Truth will be revealed and retold during the times of the Apocalypse."

From a philosophical perspective, Truth can be understood as the state or quality of being in accordance with fact or reality. It is an objective reality that exists independently of human opinion or belief, and it can be discovered through reason, empirical observation, and critical thinking.

While truth can be difficult to discern, it is often associated with certain qualities or hallmarks, such as coherence, consistency, accuracy, and transparency. These qualities help to distinguish truth from falsehood, and they provide a standard by which truth claims can be evaluated.

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

In very simple terms, The Truth as understood from the lenses of RaÃ«lism is that life on Earth was created by a group of scientists from a distant planet who had achieved a level of technical and scientific knowledge comparable to that which humans will soon reach. The scientists created artificial life, including primitive animals and plants, and eventually, land animals and humans, who were kept in ignorance of scientific knowledge to prevent them from becoming a danger to their creators' home planet. The passage suggests that the story of the creation of the Earth as described in the Book of Genesis has been distorted and misunderstood over time, and that it contains traces of the truth about the origins of life on Earth.

Such a claim would challenges traditional views of the origins of life on Earth, and raises many questions about the nature of reality and the role of science and technology in shaping our world.
