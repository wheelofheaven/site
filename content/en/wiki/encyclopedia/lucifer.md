title: "Lucifer"
description: "Lucifer (Latin for Light-Bringer, or hêlēl, Hebrew: הֵילֵל, which means the same), not to be confused with Satan, is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the representative of a faction within the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) that supports the existence of a prospering offspring civilization on Earth. As such, Lucifer is not a proper name, but an metaphorical epithet accounting for the role that Lucifer had played during the early days of humanit, as the one that brought light. the Latin name Lucifer as well as the Semitic name hêlēl also stand for the morning star, Venus, which preceeds the Sun during a given sunrise."
