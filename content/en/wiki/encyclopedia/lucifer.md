title: "Lucifer"
description: "Lucifer (Latin for Light-Bringer, or hêlēl, Hebrew: הֵילֵל, which means the same), not to be confused with Satan, is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the representative of a faction within the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) that support the existence of a prospering offspring civilization on Earth. As such, Lucifer is not a proper name, but an metaphorical form of the role that Lucifer represents for humanity, that of the one that brings light. Lucifer as well as the Semitic name hêlēl stand for the morning star, Venus, which preceeds the Sun during sunrise."
