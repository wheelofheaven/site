title: "Lucifer"
description: "Lucifer (Latin for Light-Bringer, or hêlēl, Hebrew: הֵילֵל, which means the same), not to be confused with Satan, is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the representative of a faction within the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) that supports a thriving human civilization on Earth. It is not a proper name, but a metaphorical term for the role of bringing light. The name Lucifer and its Semitic counterpart hêlēl both refer to the morning star, Venus, which rises before the sun at sunrise"
