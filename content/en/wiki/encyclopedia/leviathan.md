### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim came to hide in the oceans:

> The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.
>
>> In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
>>
>> â€” Isaiah 27: 1.
>
> At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.
