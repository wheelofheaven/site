The Leviathan is a mythical sea monster mentioned in the Bible, specifically in the book of Job and in the book of Psalms. In the Bible, the Leviathan is described as a powerful and fearsome creature that lives in the sea and is difficult to control.

The Leviathan has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. In some interpretations, it is seen as a symbol of chaos and evil, while in others it is viewed as a symbol of the power of God and the natural order of the universe. In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, the Leviathan is often associated with the idea of a great, apocalyptic battle between good and evil, in which God will defeat the monster and restore order to the world.

In popular culture, the Leviathan has been depicted in many different ways, often as a giant sea serpent or dragon. It has also been used as a metaphor for various forms of evil, oppression, and tyranny throughout history. The image of the Leviathan continues to hold great cultural and symbolic significance, and it is often referenced in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture.

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim came to hide in the oceans:

> The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.
>
>> In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
>>
>> â€” Isaiah 27: 1.
>
> At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.

The Leviathan is the group of scientists led by Lucifer, also known as the Serpent, who had been banished at the outset and had hidden themselves in the oceans, and according to Isaiah 27:1, the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.
