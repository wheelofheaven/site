title: "Infinity"
description: "Infinity, a scientific insight of the highest order as it postulates the very perpetual extent of time as well of space. There is no center as there is no beginning nor end. Two ancient symbols known throughout the world and ages testify of this wisdom of old given to us by the Elohim, namely the Swastika representing the cyclical nature of time and timelessness, and Magen David representing in turn that what is above is below, meaning the way space expands to greater macrosopic levels is the same as the way the space within the microscopic levels folds down to."
