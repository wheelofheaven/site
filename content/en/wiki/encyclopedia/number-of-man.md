title: "Number of Man"
description: "Number of Man, also known as the Number of the Beast or simply by the value it represents, 666 (χξϛ), is the number of human generations that will have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men during Genesis. If a generation is defined to last 20 years, the product of the Number of Man amounts to 13'320 years. If we have just entered the Age of Aquarius and we assume this coincides with the Number of Man, the first human being must have been created half a precessional cycle ago, which would be at the beginning of the Age of Leo.."
