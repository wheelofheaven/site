### In Raëlism

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter, Truth, where Yahweh explicitly mentions the Tower of Babel and says the following about its specific purpose:

> But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators' planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket — The Tower of Babel.
>
>> And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
>>
>> — Genesis 11: 6.
