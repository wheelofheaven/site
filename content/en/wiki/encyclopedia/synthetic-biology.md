title: "Synthetic biology"
description: "Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from biology, genetics, and engineering to design and construct artificial biological systems, genetic circuits, and organisms with novel functions or characteristics. It involves the deliberate modification or creation of genetic material and the engineering of biological components to program living cells to perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits. Synthetic biology aims to understand and re-engineer biological systems."

## Relationship with synthetic genomics

Synthetic biology and synthetic genomics are closely related fields, but there are subtle differences between the two:

- **Synthetic biology**: Synthetic biology, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of activities and approaches. It involves the application of engineering principles to design and construct biological systems or components with novel functions. Synthetic biology encompasses the design and engineering of genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, proteins, and other biological modules to create new organisms or modify existing ones. It integrates various disciplines such as biology, genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to create synthetic biological systems that can perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits.

- **Synthetic genomics**: Synthetic genomics primarily focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes. It involves the creation of artificial DNA sequences that mimic or differ from existing natural genomes. Synthetic genomics often aims to understand the minimal set of genes necessary for a living organism's functioning and can involve the creation of synthetic chromosomes or even entire synthetic genomes. It is a branch of genetic engineering that deals specifically with the construction of genetic material.

Synthetic genomics focuses on the creation of artificial genomes or large segments of genomes, while synthetic biology encompasses a wider range of activities, including the design and construction of genetic circuits, proteins, and other biological components, to create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic genomics can be considered a subset of synthetic biology that specifically deals with the construction of genetic material.
