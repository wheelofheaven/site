### Law of masstime

The law of masstime simply states that **time is inversely proportional to mass**.

The law can easily be derived empirically from observing various kinetic bodies, especially apparent in life forms, that each feature various masses. A eukaryotic cell causes a higher amount of gesticulations in a given span of time in relation to its body size than an ant would cause. An ant in turn does cause more kinetic activity than an elephant would. An elephant causes, to increase the scale of mass even further, amount of motion than a higher kinetic body such as a planet would. The law is universal insofar it applies to all levels of existence and therefore applies to cosmic bodies as much as to Earthly life forms. That induces that a give planet does cause a higher amount of motion by resolving its revolutions than a galaxy would in the same amount of time relative to its size, which in turn would do cause more motion than an even higher-scale entity. So on and so forth.

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

In Chapter 2 "Neither God Nor Soul", Yahweh says the following about the perception of time:

> You must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a "God" and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.
>
> Time is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.
>
> The Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.
