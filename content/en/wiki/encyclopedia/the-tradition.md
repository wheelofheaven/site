title: "The Tradition"
description: "The Tradition, a set of oral and written perennial truths that have been passed down over many generations and throughout various civilizations and have therefore kept intact the knowledge repository that originated in a remote past. The Tradition doesn't necessarily refer to a specific set of scriptures or books, but can be understood as the cultural and mythological legacy of all the individual people that had formalized the highest truths in a codified and allegedly incorruptable manner."
