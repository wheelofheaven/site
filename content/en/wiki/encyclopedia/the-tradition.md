The Tradition doesn't necessarily refer to a specific set of scriptures or books, but can be understood as the cultural and mythological legacy of all the individual people that had formalized the highest truths in a codified and allegedly incorruptable manner."

Tradition refers to beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to another, often over many centuries or even millennia. It encompasses a wide range of cultural expressions, from religious rituals and moral codes to artistic styles and social norms. Traditions are often seen as a way of connecting people with their cultural heritage and preserving their collective identity and history.

Over the centuries, many different traditions have developed in different parts of the world. For example, some traditions are associated with particular religious beliefs, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, while others are based on cultural practices, such as the traditions of indigenous peoples or the festivals and customs of various ethnic groups.

## Hermetic tradition

The Tradition, also known as Hermetic philosophy or Hermeticism, is a philosophical and spiritual movement that dates back to ancient Greece and Egypt. It's based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who was said to be the author of a body of wisdom texts known as the Corpus Hermeticum. The Tradition encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, and is considered by some to be a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge.

One of the key components of The Tradition is alchemy, which is often seen as an early form of chemistry. The alchemists of the Hermetic tradition were interested in the transformation of matter and the search for the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and grant eternal life. They also developed a symbolic language that used alchemical symbols and allegories to describe the process of transmutation.

Another aspect of The Tradition is astrology, which was considered a science in ancient times and played a significant role in the development of astronomy. The astrologers of The Tradition believed that the positions and movements of celestial bodies had a direct influence on human affairs and that the study of the stars could reveal secrets about the universe and the nature of reality.

The Hermetic tradition also includes magic and theurgy, which are spiritual practices aimed at attaining union with the divine. The Hermetic magi used ritual and meditation to evoke spirits, perform divination, and bring about spiritual transformations. The theurgists of The Tradition believed that they could perform miracles and attain divine knowledge through ritual practices, and they sought to achieve union with the gods through the practice of theurgy.

In conclusion, The Tradition can be understood as a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge because it encompasses aspects of alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, which were considered sciences in ancient times and were used to explore the nature of reality and attain knowledge of the divine. Although some of the beliefs and practices of The Tradition may seem strange or archaic by modern standards, they are still of interest to many people today and continue to be studied and practiced by esoteric communities around the world.
