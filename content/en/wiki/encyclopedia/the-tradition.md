Tradition refers to beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to another, often over many centuries or even millennia. It encompasses a wide range of cultural expressions, from religious rituals and moral codes to artistic styles and social norms. Traditions are often seen as a way of connecting people with their cultural heritage and preserving their collective identity and history.

Over the centuries, many different traditions have developed in different parts of the world. For example, some traditions are associated with particular religious beliefs, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, while others are based on cultural practices, such as the traditions of indigenous peoples or the festivals and customs of various ethnic groups.

## Hermetic tradition

The Tradition, also known as Hermetic philosophy or Hermeticism, is a philosophical and spiritual movement that dates back to ancient Greece and Egypt. It's based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who was said to be the author of a body of wisdom texts known as the Corpus Hermeticum. The Tradition encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, and is considered by some to be a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge.

One of the key components of The Tradition is alchemy, which is often seen as an early form of chemistry. The alchemists of the Hermetic tradition were interested in the transformation of matter and the search for the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and grant eternal life. They also developed a symbolic language that used alchemical symbols and allegories to describe the process of transmutation.

Another aspect of The Tradition is astrology, which was considered a science in ancient times and played a significant role in the development of astronomy. The astrologers of The Tradition believed that the positions and movements of celestial bodies had a direct influence on human affairs and that the study of the stars could reveal secrets about the universe and the nature of reality.

The Hermetic tradition also includes magic and theurgy, which are spiritual practices aimed at attaining union with the divine. The Hermetic magi used ritual and meditation to evoke spirits, perform divination, and bring about spiritual transformations. The theurgists of The Tradition believed that they could perform miracles and attain divine knowledge through ritual practices, and they sought to achieve union with the gods through the practice of theurgy.

In conclusion, The Tradition can be understood as a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge because it encompasses aspects of alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, which were considered sciences in ancient times and were used to explore the nature of reality and attain knowledge of the divine. Although some of the beliefs and practices of The Tradition may seem strange or archaic by modern standards, they are still of interest to many people today and continue to be studied and practiced by esoteric communities around the world.

## According to Jean Sendy

Jean Sendy, a French author who wrote on the subject of ancient astronauts, translates Elohim as the "gods from the sky" or the Celestials. He argues that the term Elohim in the Hebrew Bible refers to a group of beings that were not strictly divine, but rather a class of powerful, advanced beings from the celestial sky who interacted with humanity.

### A Gentleman's Joyous Esotericism

In a seminal paper of the same title, Stefano Bigliardi fleshes out an accurate portrayal of Jean Sendy. As the notion of an inherited Tradition is a central key aspect of Sendy's thought, in the seminal paper, the Tradition is introduced through the references to Jean Sendy's book _Les cahiers de cours de Moïse_ (French for Moses' course notebooks) as follows:

> Sendy’s hypothesis is that Moses was the custodian of an ancestral “Tradition.” The Tradition involves an historical and a prophetic element. The history is that of the arrival on earth of extra-terrestrial cosmonauts, which Sendy calls Theosites (their home planet being Theos, p. 201). The Book of Genesis is, therefore, an account of their arrival and of their manipulation of humans, as well as the Earth’s environment, over a long period of time. Each “day” in Genesis can be understood as a specific phase in the Theosites’ presence on our planet, and each phase corresponds, in turn, to the sun’s different positions at dawn, with reference to the constellations of the horoscope. These positions shift over the millennia (a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, pp. 33-44). The prophetical part of the Tradition, which, likewise, makes reference to the precession, hints at humanity’s spiritual and technological development after the Theosites left our planet.

Bigliardi mentions Sendy's understanding of the Tradition further on:

> Concerning the prophetic part of the Tradition, according to Sendy, humanity has entered the Age of Aquarius, in which its development is comparable to that of the Theosites.

> All those civilizations that were able to conserve the Tradition flourished, according 
to Sendy, whereas the remaining ones went astray.

> To begin with, Catholicism is seen by Sendy as a repository of Tradition, and hence as a vessel of correct knowledge and orientation for humanity in scientific, as well as ethical, matters. Sendy remarks that the Jesuits were also custodians of the Tradition and they were perfectly aware, therefore, that Columbus would reach America and not the Indies (pp. 300-301).
