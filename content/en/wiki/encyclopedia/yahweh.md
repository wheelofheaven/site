title: "Yahweh"
description: "Yahweh (יהוה), also known as the First and the Last (Alpha and Omega) is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the lead representative of the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) as a whole. He is an Eternal in the sense that he has already inhabited multiple bodies (a Elohimian technique to live forever) and therefore member of the Council of Eternals acting as their head of Council. In Biblical scriptures, Yahweh is identifed as the main singular god and is also interchangeably equated with the civilization he's representing, the Elohim. Yahweh was also the Eloha that Raël met on multiple occassions, as did all the prophets that came before him."
