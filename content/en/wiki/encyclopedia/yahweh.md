title: "Yahweh"
description: "Yahweh (יהוה), also known as the First and the Last (Alpha and Omega) is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the lead representative of the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) as a whole. He is an Eternal in the sense that he has already inhabited multiple bodies (a Elohimian technique to live forever) and therefore member of the Council of Eternals acting as their head of Council. In Biblical scriptures, Yahweh is identifed as the main singular god and is also interchangeably equated with the civilization he's representing, the Elohim. Yahweh was also the Eloha that Raël met on multiple occassions, as did all the prophets that came before him."

Yahweh is the English transliteration of the tetragrammaton YHWH, a four-letter Hebrew name of God that is considered too sacred to be pronounced. Yahweh is considered the personal name of God in Judaism and is the name used most often in the Hebrew Bible. In English, it is often written as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah."

YHWH is considered the personal name of God in Judaism and is the name used most often in the Hebrew Bible. It is also the name used in Jewish liturgy and prayers, where it is often abbreviated as "Adonai" (Lord) in order to avoid speaking the divine name directly.

The exact meaning of YHWH is not clear, but it is thought to derive from the Hebrew verb "to be," suggesting that God is the source of all existence. The use of YHWH as the personal name of God reflects the Jewish belief in a personal, loving, and involved deity who is present in the world and actively involved in the lives of his people.
