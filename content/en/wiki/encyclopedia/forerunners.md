description: "The Forerunners were an extraordinarily advanced extraterrestrial civilization believed to have created the Elohim, a humanoid race who themselves became creators, genetically engineering life on Earth. The true nature and identity of the Forerunners remain largely a mystery, as they seemingly disappeared before the Elohim could physically encounter or directly learn from them. Their legacy, however, survives in the form of their vast scientific knowledge, which was preserved and could be one day passed down to humanity."

## In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

In an encounter between Yahweh, the president of the Elohimian council of Eternals, and RaÃ«l, the identity of the Forerunners is revelead. The Forerunners' level of scientific advancement was so great that they managed to install a massive space station in orbit around the Elohim's home planet. This station housed the entirety of their knowledge, which was programmed to automatically descend to the planet in the event of their civilization's destruction. This act demonstrates their foresight and their intent to ensure the continuity of their knowledge and legacy, regardless of their own survival.

Though their own world presumably perished due to an unidentified catastrophe, their technological marvel and wisdom lived on, as the Elohim inherited this knowledge, using it to develop their own civilization and eventually to create life on other planets, including Earth.

Interestingly, despite their remarkable scientific progress, the Forerunners' civilization was not found elsewhere in the known universe by the Elohim. This has led to speculation that they may have faced a calamitous event, such as their sun exploding, becoming too cold, or their planet getting too close to the sun, rendering life unsustainable. Yet, their story remains a beacon of hope and continuity for both the Elohim and, through them, humanity on Earth. Should a similar catastrophe befall the Elohim, a similar arrangement is in place to pass on their knowledge, furthering the legacy of the Forerunners.
