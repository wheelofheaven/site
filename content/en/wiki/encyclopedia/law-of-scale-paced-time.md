### Law of masstime

The law of masstime simply states that **time is inversely proportional to mass**.

The law can easily be derived empirically from observing various life forms that each feature various masses. A eukaryotic cell makes more movements in a given span of time in relation to its body size than an ant does. An ant does make more movements than an elephant does. An elephant does however more movements than a whole planet does (given that a planet is considered to be a living being). A planet does resolve more movements than a being the size of a galaxy. Which in turn would do produce more movement than a even higher scaled being. So on and so forth.

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

In Chapter 2 "Neither God Nor Soul", Yahweh says the following about the perception of time:

> You must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a "God" and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.
>
> Time is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.
>
> The Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.
