The Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that aims to understand the nature of God and the universe. It teaches that there are ten divine emanations from God and the purpose of creation. It also includes meditative and magical practices to achieve union with God. The Kabbalah has roots in early Jewish mysticism that date back to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, but its written form began to develop in the late 12th and early 13th centuries in Provence and Spain. The classic texts of Kabbalah, such as "The Book of Creation" and "The Zohar," were written in the late 12th to early 14th centuries.

The main books of Kabbalah include:

- "The Book of Creation" (Sefer Yetzirah)
- "The Zohar" (Book of Splendor)
- "The Bahir" (Book of Brightness)
- "Etz Chaim" (Tree of Life)
- "Sefer Ha-Razim" (Book of Mysteries)
- "Sefer Ha-Hezyonot" (Book of Visions)

Some of the most well-known and influential Kabbalistic texts were written by Spanish Kabbalists such as Moses de Leon (who is credited with writing "The Zohar"), Isaac Luria (known as the Ari), and Shlomo Alkabetz. Other important figures in the development of Kabbalah include the German Kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin and the 16th-century Safed school of Kabbalists led by Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria. Kabbalah is still considered an important part of Jewish spirituality and culture by many Jews today. Its teachings and practices continue to influence contemporary spirituality and have inspired new interpretations and adaptations in various spiritual traditions. Additionally, Kabbalah has had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, literature, and the arts. While it is primarily a form of Jewish mysticism, its ideas and practices have also been adopted and studied by individuals from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.

### Alexandre Safran

Jean Sendy often refers to Alexandre Safran, the Grand Rabbi of Geneva, who himself authored a treatise named 'La Cabale' and got published in 1960. Therein, the very nature of the Kabbalah as a tradition is explained.

Jean Sendy writes the following about Alexandre Safran and his book La Cabale:

> « Le message préservé par la Kabale porte sur la correspondance des deux mondes, céleste et terrestre, sur leur unification par l’homme. [...] L’homme renouvellera les actes relatés au début de la Genèse », écrit Alexandre Safran, grand-rabbin de Genève, dans la Kabale (Payot), où il précise aussi que « la Kabale remonte aux temps préhistoriques ; Moïse ne fait que l’introduire dans l’Histoire d’Israël ».
