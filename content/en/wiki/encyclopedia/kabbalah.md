The Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that aims to understand the nature of God and the universe. It teaches that there are ten divine emanations from God and the purpose of creation. It also includes meditative and magical practices to achieve union with God. The Kabbalah has roots in early Jewish mysticism that date back to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, but its written form began to develop in the late 12th and early 13th centuries in Provence and Spain. The classic texts of Kabbalah, such as "The Book of Creation" and "The Zohar," were written in the late 12th to early 14th centuries.

The main books of Kabbalah include:

- "Sefer Yetzirah" (Book of Creation)
- "The Zohar" (Book of Splendor)
- "The Bahir" (Book of Brightness)
- "Etz Chaim" (Tree of Life)
- "Sefer Ha-Razim" (Book of Mysteries)
- "Sefer Ha-Hezyonot" (Book of Visions)

Some of the most well-known and influential Kabbalistic texts were written by Spanish Kabbalists such as Moses de Leon (who is credited with writing "The Zohar"), Isaac Luria (known as the Ari), and Shlomo Alkabetz. Other important figures in the development of Kabbalah include the German Kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin and the 16th-century Safed school of Kabbalists led by Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria. Kabbalah is still considered an important part of Jewish spirituality and culture by many Jews today. Its teachings and practices continue to influence contemporary spirituality and have inspired new interpretations and adaptations in various spiritual traditions. Additionally, Kabbalah has had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, literature, and the arts. While it is primarily a form of Jewish mysticism, its ideas and practices have also been adopted and studied by individuals from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.

### The Zohar

The Zohar is a central text in the Kabbalah. It was written in medieval Spain in the 13th century and is said to contain the secret wisdom of the Torah. The Zohar is written in Aramaic and is a commentary on the Torah, the Hebrew Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament).

The Zohar's central teaching is that God's essence is not fully revealed in the physical world and that only through mystical contemplation and study can one truly understand the divine. It teaches that the universe was created through ten sefirot, which are emanations of God's attributes and energy.

The Zohar is structured in the form of a running commentary on the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. It takes the form of a dialogue between the mystics Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his disciples, who discuss and interpret the meaning of various verses and passages in the Torah.

In addition to the commentary on the Torah, the Zohar also contains homilies, parables, and allegories that elaborate on its central teachings. The text is divided into several sections, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the divine realm, such as the sefirot (the ten attributes of God), the creation of the world, and the nature of the soul.

### Alexandre Safran

Jean Sendy often refers to Alexandre Safran, the Grand Rabbi of Geneva, who himself authored a treatise named 'La Cabale' and got published in 1960. Therein, the very nature of the Kabbalah as a tradition is explained.

Jean Sendy writes the following about Alexandre Safran and his book La Cabale:

> Â«Â Le message prÃ©servÃ© par la Kabale porte sur la correspondance des deux mondes, cÃ©leste et terrestre, sur leur unification par lâ€™homme. [...] Lâ€™homme renouvellera les actes relatÃ©s au dÃ©but de la GenÃ¨seÂ Â», Ã©crit Alexandre Safran, grand-rabbin de GenÃ¨ve, dans la Kabale (Payot), oÃ¹ il prÃ©cise aussi que Â«Â la Kabale remonte aux temps prÃ©historiquesÂ ; MoÃ¯se ne fait que lâ€™introduire dans lâ€™Histoire dâ€™IsraÃ«lÂ Â».

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Fifth Chapter "The End of the World", Section "At the Roots of All Religions", Yahweh mentions the Kabbalah as being a body of mystical traditions that are rich in allusions to our Creators, the Elohim:

> It is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.
>
> If one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. [...]
