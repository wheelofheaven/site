title: "Neo-Euhemerism"
description: "Neo-Euhemerism is a philosophical attempt at rationalizing mythology, in particular the nature of Gods and Divine Beings, in historical terms by interpreting the seemingly supernatural characteristics attributed to Gods as the consequence of their technological and scientific sophistication. Neo-Euhemerism can be understood as the philosophical paradigm to equate ancient Gods with a spacefaring civilization, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. Hence the hypothesis put forward here on Wheel of Heaven is indeed sharing a similar DNA with neo-euhemeristic premises."

### Euhemerism

Euhemerism is a philosophical and literary approach to myths and legends that views them as exaggerated accounts of historical events. The approach is named after Euhemerus, a 4th-century BCE Greek philosopher, who argued that the gods of mythology were originally historical figures who were later deified and worshipped as gods.

According to Euhemeristic theory, myths and legends were created by early societies as a way of explaining natural phenomena and cultural traditions. Over time, these accounts were embellished and transformed into grand tales of gods and heroes, but they retained some connection to the original historical events that inspired them.

Euhemerism has been influential in the study of religion, mythology, and the history of culture, and has been used as a tool for interpreting the beliefs and practices of ancient societies. Some modern scholars have criticized Euhemerism for oversimplifying the complex interplay between history, culture, and religion, but it remains an important perspective in the study of mythology and ancient beliefs.

### Neo-euhemerism

Neo-Euhemerism is a modern interpretation of the ancient philosophy of Euhemerism, which views myths and legends as exaggerated accounts of historical events. While the original Euhemeristic approach emphasized the historical basis of myth and saw the gods of mythology as originally historical figures who were later deified, neo-Euhemerism expands on this approach and views myth as a symbolic representation of the human experience.
