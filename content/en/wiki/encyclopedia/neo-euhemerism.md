title: "Neo-Euhemerism"
description: "Neo-Euhemerism is a philosophical attempt at rationalizing mythology, in particular the nature of Gods and Divine Beings, in historical terms by interpreting the seemingly supernatural characteristics attributed to Gods as the consequence of their technological and scientific sophistication. Neo-Euhemerism can be understood as the philosophical paradigm to equate ancient Gods with a spacefaring civilization, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. Hence the hypothesis put forward here on Wheel of Heaven is indeed sharing a similar DNA with neo-euhemeristic premises."
