### In Buddhism ‚ò∏Ô∏è

Sa·πÉsƒÅra (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞, Pali: sa·πÉsƒÅra; also samsara) in Buddhism and Hinduism is the beginningless cycle of repeated birth, mundane existence and dying again.[1] Samsara is considered to be dukkha, suffering, and in general unsatisfactory and painful,[2] perpetuated by desire and avidya (ignorance), and the resulting karma.

#### The Wheel of Life (Bhavacakra)

The bhavacakra (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡§µ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞; PƒÅli: bhavacakka; Tibetan: ‡Ω¶‡æ≤‡Ω≤‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ω†‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω†‡ΩÅ‡Ωº‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ω£‡Ωº, Wylie: srid pa'i 'khor lo) is a symbolic representation of sa·πÉsƒÅra (or cyclic existence). It is found on the outside walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help non Buddhists understand Buddhist teachings. It is used in Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.

It usually depicts 12 houses in a circle/wheel.

### In Ra√´lism üîØ

According to the second book _Book Which Tells The Truth_, 2nd Chapter, Buddhism, Yahweh demystifies a core tenet of Buddhism:

> Buddhism explains that at the time of death, the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils, otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle. On the other hand, if it manages to escape those infamous devils, it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening.
>
> In fact, this is a very good description, which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole. It must resist those devils, which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position to choose. Those "devils" are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature, and the "state of bliss through awakening" is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people, thus producing an earthly paradise, where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means.
>
If humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils, it will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world, with all the suffering which that entails.
>
> That is why we can find the swastika in our symbol, as in numerous ancient writings, which signifies "the cycle". It is the choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.
