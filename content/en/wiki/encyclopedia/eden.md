The Garden of Eden, also known simply as Eden, is a biblical story that describes a perfect and idyllic paradise where the first human beings, Adam and Eve, lived. The story of Eden is described in the first three chapters of the book of Genesis in the Bible.

According to the biblical account, God created the Garden of Eden as a place of perfect beauty and abundance. The Garden was filled with every kind of tree that was pleasing to the eye and good for food, and God placed the first human beings, Adam and Eve, there to live and care for it. God gave Adam and Eve complete freedom in the Garden, but warned them not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, or they would surely die.

However, a serpent appeared and tempted Eve to eat from the forbidden tree, promising her that she would not die, but would become like God, knowing good and evil. Eve ate from the tree and then gave some to Adam, and as a result, their eyes were opened and they realized that they were naked. They felt ashamed and covered themselves with fig leaves.

When God came to the Garden, he discovered that Adam and Eve had disobeyed him and had eaten from the forbidden tree. As a result, God punished them by expelling them from the Garden and placing an angel with a flaming sword to guard the entrance, so that they could not enter the garden of Eden anymore.

## In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter Truth, Genesis, where Eden is heavily implied being synonymous with the biblical paradise, says the following about this specific place:

> The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.
>
> Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call "paradise on Earth". The human beings they created there were the most intelligent.

In other words, Yahweh tells us that Eden is an antediluvian, proto-pangaean region during the Genesis phase. This region on the former Pangean continent came to what we known as the Levant after the Great Flood, or more specifically as Yahweh says himself, the land we now call Israel.

Out of the seven creator teams, one industrious and talented team that happened to be conducting their Genesis projects within this Eden region managed to engineer outstanding life forms. Besides the supposedly impressive flora and faune, the human type that got incepted there is considered the most intelligent one.
