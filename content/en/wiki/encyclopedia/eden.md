### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯


According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter Truth, Genesis, where Eden is heavily implied being synonymous with the biblical paradise, says the following about this specific place:

> The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.
>
> Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call "paradise on Earth". The human beings they created there were the most intelligent.

In other words, Yahweh tells us that Eden is an antediluvian, proto-pangaean region during the Genesis phase. This region on the former Pangean continent came to what we known as the Levant after the Great Flood, or more specifically as Yahweh says himself, the land we now call Israel.

Out of the seven creator teams, one industrious and talented team that happened to be conducting their Genesis projects within this Eden region managed to engineer outstanding life forms. Besides the supposedly impressive flora and faune, the human type that got incepted there is considered the most intelligent one.
