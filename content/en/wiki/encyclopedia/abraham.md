### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

Abraham is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with RaÃ«l. The following reference from Rael's first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth ([see here](https://wheelofheaven.github.io/rael-one-the-book-which-tells-the-truth/2_the_truth.html#the-sacrifice-of-abraham)), showcases the mentioning of Abraham:

> Later, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.

>> Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. â€” Genesis 22: 12.
