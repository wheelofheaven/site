Abraham is a central figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and is considered the father of these three monotheistic religions. In the Bible, he is described as the father of Isaac and a patriarch of the Israelites. In the Tanakh, he is considered the first Hebrew and the founder of the Jewish nation. In the Quran, Abraham is considered a prophet of Allah and a friend of God.

In the Bible, Abraham is described as:

- A Chaldean from Ur, who was called by God to leave his home and journey to a new land (Genesis 12:1-3)
- A faithful servant of God who was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22)
- The founder of the covenant between God and the Israelites, through which God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (Genesis 12:1-3, 15:18)
- The ancestor of Jesus (Matthew 1:1-17)

## In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

Abraham is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with RaÃ«l. The following reference from Rael's first book, [The Book Which Tells The Truth]({{< relref "resources/the-book-which-tells-the-truth.md" >}})<sup>ðŸ“–</sup>, showcases the mentioning of Abraham:

> Later, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.
>
>> Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. â€” Genesis 22: 12.

This passage is discussing a story from the book of Genesis in the Bible, where the Elohim wanted to test the people of Israel, particularly their leader, Abraham, to see if they still held positive feelings towards them. At the time of the test, the people had relapsed into a semi-primitive state after many of their intellectuals were destroyed. The test involved Abraham being asked to sacrifice his own son, and his willingness to do so was taken as a sign of his loyalty and devotion to the creators. The creators ultimately intervened and prevented the sacrifice, indicating that they were satisfied with Abraham's loyalty.
