## The Method

[The Naked Bible]({{< relref "resources/the-naked-bible/index.md" >}}) is a book written by the Italian journalist, playwright and screenwriter Giorgio Cattaneo and the Italian scholar Mauro Biglino, which challenges the traditional understanding of the Bible. In their book, Cattaneo writes about how Biglino argues that the texts of the Old Testament, specifically the Torah, were not divinely inspired, but rather were written by ancient scribes who recorded the history and beliefs of their society. Therein, Biglino claims that the text has been mistranslated and misinterpreted over time, and that a more accurate understanding of the Bible would reveal that it is not a divine text, but rather a historical document that reflects the cultural and political context of its authors.

On page 119 in The Naked Bible a _method_ is being described that Mauro Biglino consistently applied in his scholarly work as stated throughout the book:

> The Biglino method works like this: ‘pretend’ that the Bible is simply telling the truth.

This means that the Bible, when read literally, suddenly becomes more consistent and appears to tell a fundamentally different story than commonly suggested by established Christian institutions such as the Catholic Church. Later in the same book, the following is stated:

> What does the text actually describe in the original Hebrew?
>
> A completely different story.
>
> Biglino opened that box. And he has never closed it. “This type of project, which I worked on for a few years, brought me into direct contact, let’s say, with the very origins, with the etymology of each individual word. Terms that, time after time, are put back into the context of the stories. Words that gave birth to a mosaic that is totally different from what is traditionally told to us.”
>
> He started doing this in 2010. Then he began to publish everything he thought he was really reading in the Masoretic Hebrew codex.
>
> “And so I poured out my doubts, my perplexities, my questions on paper. I expressed my feelings, in describing what was coming out of it. And always with a precise method: ‘let’s pretend that it’s true.’”

The book is written in a way where Cattaneo explores the scholarly work of Biglino by quoting and contextualizing a series of Biglino statements. These statements are decorated with appropriate quotation marks in the various passages highlighted here. Biglino says that the main method of his scholarly work consists of "pretending" what the Bible says "is true". It goes on:

> In other words, “Let’s pretend” that what is written in the Bible is true.
>
> So… is it true?
>
> “Who knows? No one can guarantee it.”
>
> So, let’s pretend that it is.
>
> “To be clear, it is not a playful method. In my opinion, though, it is the only proper one, precisely because we cannot be sure that what is written in the Bible is true. We do not possess the original codices. We only have copies of copies of copies, continually re-worked over time.”
>
> This is confirmed by the biblical scholars of the Jewish universities themselves, such as those in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
>
> “If there is one thing we can be sure of, it’s that the texts we have today are not the ones that were originally compiled, because every time they re-wrote them, they changed them.”
>
> And this is certainly not just a biblical anomaly or exclusive to the Old Testament.
>
> “Naturally, this applies to all ancient texts, not just the Bible. So where’s the problem? The Bible is the only one on which a system of religious thought has been built, thought that claims to be the bearer of absolute, unquestionable truths.”
>
> This is the real anomaly, and this really is exclusive.
>
> “If we accept the Bible for what it is and treat it accordingly, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, there’s no problem. If, however, we want to mine out absolute truths, then I say that we should at least go and see what the text says. ‘Let’s pretend’ that what is written is true. And let’s see what comes of that.”
>
> This is the fruit of the Biglino method, the result of long and patient work, offered to the readers.
>
> “Basically I say, ‘This text, later interpreted for other purposes by various theologies of different origins, must in fact be separated from those intentions and be simply read again, just like all other ancient sources.’”
>
> The problem?
>
> “It arises when we want to consider the text as unique in the history of humanity because it was ‘inspired by God.’ And unfortunately (I say ‘unfortunately’ for those who believe) the Bible simply isn’t.”


The method involves pretending that the Bible is true and examining the original Hebrew text to understand its actual description. However, it is acknowledged that no one can guarantee the truthfulness of the Bible, as we only have copies of copies of the original codices, which have been reworked over time. This approach is not considered playful but rather the only appropriate one given the uncertainty surrounding the Bible's accuracy. It is noted that the texts we have today are not the original ones, as they have been changed with each rewriting. This phenomenon is not exclusive to the Bible but applies to all ancient texts. The anomaly lies in the fact that the Bible has been the basis for a religious system claiming to possess absolute truths. Ultimately, the Biglino method suggests treating the Bible as an ancient source separate from theological intentions and reading it like any other ancient text.
