title: "Satan"
description: "Satan (śāṭān, Hebrew: שָׂטָן), not to be confused with Lucifer, is an Eloha (אֱלוֹהַּ) and the representative of a faction within the Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) that opposes the existence of a prospering offspring civilization on Earth which is seen as a threat to their remote well-being. As such, Satan is not a proper name, but an indicative form of the role that Satan fills, namely that of an obstructor, of an accuser."
