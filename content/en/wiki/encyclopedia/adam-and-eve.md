Adam and Eve are the first man and woman according to the creation story in the Bible's book of Genesis. They are considered the first human beings created by God, and are believed to have lived in the Garden of Eden before disobeying God's command and being expelled from the garden (Genesis 3). Adam is described as the first man created by God from the dust of the ground, while Eve is described as the first woman, created from one of Adam's ribs (Genesis 2:7, 2:22). Adam and Eve's story is often seen as an allegory for the origin of sin and the fall of humanity.

### Etymology

The etymology of the name of both Adam and Eve is uncertain, and several theories have been proposed for each name on their own.

One theory is that the name "Adam" is derived from the Hebrew word "adamah," which means "earth" or "soil." This is in line with the biblical account of Adam being formed from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7). Another theory is that the name "Adam" is derived from the Akkadian word "adamu," which means "to make" or "to create." This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Adam as the first human being created by God. A third theory is that the name "Adam" is related to the Hebrew word "adom," which means "red." This interpretation is based on the idea that the color red symbolizes life and vitality, and that the name Adam reflects the idea of the first human as the source of life.

On for Adam's companion Eve, the etymology of the name "Eve" is as already mention neither certain, but it is thought to be derived from the Hebrew word "chavah," which means "to give life." This interpretation is in line with the biblical account of Eve being the mother of all living things (Genesis 3:20). Another theory is that the name "Eve" is related to the Hebrew word "haya," which means "to live." This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Eve as the source of life for all humankind. In addition, the name "Eve" has been connected to the Akkadian word "awwatu," which means "living one," further emphasizing the idea of Eve as a symbol of life and vitality.
