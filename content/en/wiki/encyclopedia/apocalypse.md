### In Ra√´lism üîØ

According to the second book _Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet_, Chapter The Keys, the Apocalpyse as the Age of Revelation is mentioned in the context of being one of the keys to unlock our potential:

> Do not forget that the Apocalypse ‚Äîliterally the "age of revelation"‚Äî has arrived as was predicted. It has been said that when the time comes, there will be many false prophets. You only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come. False prophets are writers of horoscopes of which the newspapers are full, and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the Elohim to the primitive people of ancient times.
>
> Such false prophets prefer to believe what narrow-minded and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. They should instead believe the message of the Elohim that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky. These latter people try to understand the universe, and they can be addressed as adults.
