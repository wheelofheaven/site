title: "Wheel of Heaven"
description: "Wheel of Heaven, a web knowledge base exploring the working hypothesis that life on Earth was intelligently designed by the extraterrestrial civilization we collectively remember as the Elohim. The Wheel of Heaven itself is a metaphorical reference to the precession of equinoxes as being a heavenly wheel of constellations that steadily keeps on turning. It is also a slightly more obscure reference to Akhenaton, an Egyptian pharao of old who described a disk shaped space ship as looking like a wheel in heaven."
