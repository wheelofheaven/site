The 7-day creation myth in the book of Genesis is a story that describes the origin of the universe and everything in it, including the Earth and all living creatures. According to the story, God created the world and everything in it in six days, and on the seventh day, he rested.

Each of the six days of creation is described in detail, and on each day, God creates something new. On the first day, God creates light and separates it from darkness. On the second day, he creates the sky and the oceans. On the third day, he creates land and vegetation. On the fourth day, he creates the sun, moon, and stars. On the fifth day, he creates the birds and sea creatures. On the sixth day, he creates the land animals and humans.

The 7-day creation myth is considered by many to be a foundational story in the Bible and an important part of the Judeo-Christian tradition. While it is widely accepted as a religious and cultural narrative, the interpretation of the story has been the subject of much debate and discussion throughout history, particularly in light of modern scientific discoveries. Some view the story as a literal account of the creation of the universe, while others interpret it metaphorically or allegorically.

### Seven days as in seven Great Months

The idea that the "days" mentioned in the Biblical creation narrative of Genesis could be understood as representing much longer periods of time, specifically 2,190 years each, is based on the belief in the concept of precessional cycles. Precession refers to the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth's axis, which takes approximately 26,000 years to complete one cycle.

According to this interpretation, each "day" in the creation story would represent one of the 12 astrological ages in the precession cycle, with each age lasting approximately 2,190 years. Proponents of this interpretation argue that the seven days of creation correspond to the seven main astrological ages: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra.

In the Hebrew language and in the Bible, the word "yom" (יום) is typically translated as "day" and is understood to refer to a 24-hour period. The idea that "yom" could mean a much longer period of time, such as a precessional month, is not a widely accepted interpretation within the scholarly community.
