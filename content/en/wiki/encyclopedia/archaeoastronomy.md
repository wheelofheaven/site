Archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field of study that explores the knowledge, practices, and beliefs related to celestial bodies and phenomena in ancient cultures. It combines principles from archaeology, anthropology, and astronomy to analyze and interpret the astronomical significance of archaeological sites, artifacts, and cultural practices. By investigating the ways in which ancient civilizations observed, recorded, and utilized astronomical information, archaeoastronomy aims to enrich our understanding of their worldviews, religious beliefs, and social organization.

One of the central aims of archaeoastronomy is to identify and understand the astronomical alignments of ancient monuments and structures. These alignments may have been intended for calendrical purposes, such as marking the solstices, equinoxes, or other significant astronomical events. In some cases, these alignments may have had religious or ceremonial significance, reflecting the importance of celestial events in the culture's mythologies and rituals. Notable examples of such alignments can be found in Stonehenge in England, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and Chichen Itza in Mexico.

Archaeoastronomy also investigates the use of celestial navigation by ancient societies. Many cultures developed advanced methods for determining their position and direction by observing the stars, the sun, and the moon. The Polynesians, for example, were skilled navigators who used the stars to sail vast distances across the Pacific Ocean. Similarly, the ancient Maya developed a sophisticated calendar system based on the observation of celestial bodies, which allowed them to track time and predict astronomical events with remarkable accuracy.

The study of ancient astronomical knowledge and practices can provide valuable insights into the development of scientific thought, as well as the broader cultural context in which that knowledge was produced and transmitted. Astronomical observations were often closely linked to religious beliefs, as celestial events were seen as manifestations of divine power or omens of future events. This connection is evident in the elaborate mythologies and cosmologies that many cultures developed to explain the movements of celestial bodies and their influence on human affairs.

In recent years, archaeoastronomy has benefited from advances in technology and methodology, including remote sensing, satellite imagery, and computer modeling. These tools have allowed researchers to analyze archaeological sites and artifacts with greater precision, revealing new insights into the astronomical practices of ancient civilizations. Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, anthropologists, and astronomers has led to a more nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which astronomical knowledge was produced and used.

## Astronomical alignments

Many ancient structures, including the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, show evidence of astronomical alignments. These alignments often served as markers of celestial events or reflected the builders' understanding of the cosmos. Here, we will discuss the astronomical alignments of the Giza pyramid complex and a few other notable sites.

### Giza Pyramid Complex, Egypt

The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, the Pyramid of Menkaure, and the Great Sphinx. These monuments are believed to have been built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2580-2560 BCE. Several astronomical alignments have been identified at the site.

- **Cardinal directions**: The Great Pyramid of Giza, built as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, is remarkably aligned to the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). Its sides are almost perfectly aligned with true north, within a margin of error of just a few arcminutes. This precision suggests that the builders had advanced knowledge of astronomy and surveying techniques.

- **Orion's Belt**: The three pyramids of Giza are said to be aligned in a manner that resembles the stars of Orion's Belt in the Orion constellation. The alignment suggests that the pyramids' layout may have been intended to represent the stars in Orion's Belt, which held religious significance for the ancient Egyptians, as they associated it with the god Osiris.

### Stonehenge, England

Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a circle of standing stones. It was constructed in several stages between 3000 and 2000 BCE. The site has several astronomical alignments.

- **Summer Solstice**: One of the most famous alignments at Stonehenge occurs during the summer solstice. As the sun rises, it aligns with the Heel Stone, creating a spectacle where the sun's rays pass through the central axis of the monument. This alignment suggests that Stonehenge may have been used as a calendar or to mark important seasonal events.

- **Winter Solstice**: The site is also aligned with the winter solstice sunset. The sun sets between the two tallest stones in the monument, known as the Trilithon, during the winter solstice. This alignment further supports the idea that Stonehenge had astronomical and calendrical functions.

### Chichen Itza, Mexico

Chichen Itza is a Maya city in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, that thrived between 600 and 1200 CE. The site is renowned for its impressive architecture and astronomical alignments.

- **El Castillo**: The step pyramid known as El Castillo or the Temple of Kukulcan is the most famous structure at Chichen Itza. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, the pyramid's design creates a striking play of light and shadow. As the sun sets, triangular shadows form along the side of the northern stairway, giving the appearance of a serpent descending the pyramid. This phenomenon likely held religious significance for the Maya, who associated the serpent with the god Kukulcan.

### Angkor Wat, Cambodia

Angkor Wat, built in the early 12th century, is the largest religious monument globally and a stunning example of Khmer architecture. The temple complex was initially dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu and later converted to a Buddhist temple. The main temple's western entrance is aligned with the spring equinox. On this day, the sun rises directly over the central tower, creating a visual spectacle. The alignment may represent the balance between light and darkness, echoing Hindu cosmological beliefs.

### Temple of Karnak, Egypt
The Karnak temple complex in Luxor, Egypt, is one of the largest religious sites in the world, dating back to around 2000 BCE. The main temple is dedicated to the god Amun-Ra. The temple's axis aligns with the winter solstice sunrise, allowing the sun's rays to illuminate the inner sanctum, where the statue of Amun-Ra resided. This alignment may have been designed to imbue the statue with the sun's energy, enhancing the god's power.

## Alternative researchers

In recent years, alternative researchers like Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock, and John Anthony West have introduced new perspectives and hypotheses in the field of archaeoastronomy and archaeology more broadly. While their work is often controversial and not always accepted by mainstream academia, it has contributed to a re-examination of certain aspects of ancient cultures, their knowledge, and their capabilities. It's essential to note that their research is often considered "fringe" because it challenges conventional wisdom or explores topics that are not widely accepted by the academic community.

It's important to recognize that alternative researchers like Carlson, Hancock, and West have faced skepticism and criticism from mainstream academics, who argue that their hypotheses often lack rigorous evidence or proper methodology. However, their work has undeniably generated public interest and brought attention to the field of archaeoastronomy and ancient civilizations. In some cases, their research has encouraged further investigation and has led to new discoveries or the re-evaluation of existing evidence.

### Randall Carlson

Randall Carlson is a geological and anthropological theorist known for his work on the potential impact of cosmic events, such as asteroid impacts or cometary debris, on the Earth's climate and human history. He has suggested that these events may have caused cataclysms that contributed to the collapse of ancient civilizations and the end of the last Ice Age. His work has inspired discussions about the role of natural disasters in shaping human history and the potential astronomical knowledge of ancient cultures.

### Graham Hancock

Graham Hancock is an author and journalist who has written extensively about ancient civilizations, proposing that there may have been a highly advanced, prehistoric civilization that was wiped out by a global cataclysm. In his book "Fingerprints of the Gods," Hancock presents evidence for this lost civilization, including astronomical alignments and advanced knowledge of precession among ancient cultures. While many of his ideas are not accepted by mainstream archaeologists, Hancock's work has captured the public's imagination and has contributed to a broader interest in ancient civilizations and their astronomical knowledge.

### John Anthony West

John Anthony West was an independent Egyptologist who challenged the traditional dating of the Sphinx in Egypt. He argued that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx indicate that it is much older than previously believed, suggesting that it was constructed by a more ancient civilization with advanced knowledge of astronomy. West's work has been controversial, but it has spurred further research and debate on the age of the Sphinx and the potential astronomical significance of other ancient Egyptian monuments.
