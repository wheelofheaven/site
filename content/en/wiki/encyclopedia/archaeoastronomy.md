Archeoastronomy is the study of how ancient cultures understood and used astronomical phenomena for cultural, religious, and practical purposes. This interdisciplinary field combines archaeology, astronomy, and cultural anthropology to explore the astronomical knowledge, beliefs, and practices of ancient civilizations.

Archeoastronomy has made several significant contributions to our understanding of ancient cultures and their relationship with the sky. Some of the main insights include:

- Astronomical alignments: Archeoastronomers have studied the alignments of ancient buildings, such as pyramids, temples, and stone circles, and have found evidence that many were built to align with the rising or setting sun, moon, or stars at certain times of the year. This suggests that these celestial bodies held significant cultural and religious meaning for these civilizations.

- Calendar systems: By studying the astronomical alignments of ancient buildings and artifacts, archeoastronomers have been able to reconstruct ancient calendar systems and determine when specific astronomical events, such as solstices and eclipses, were important to ancient cultures.

- Cultural and religious beliefs: Archeoastronomy has shed light on the astronomical beliefs and practices of ancient cultures, such as their creation myths, religious ceremonies, and astronomical traditions. This has helped us to better understand their world views and how they perceived the universe.

- Technological advancements: Archeoastronomy has revealed that many ancient cultures possessed a sophisticated understanding of astronomy and advanced astronomical technology. For example, some ancient cultures used astronomical observations to create accurate calendars, while others developed sophisticated astronomical instruments, such as sundials and star charts.
