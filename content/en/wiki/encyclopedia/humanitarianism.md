### In todays usage

Humanitarianism is not a neologism, but has been in use for a while now. It proposes the belief that puts the human and humanity as a collective in the center of moralistic thinking.

Quoting the current article about Humanitarniasm on Wikipedia:
> Humanitarianism is an informal ideology of practice; it is "the doctrine that people's duty is to promote human welfare".

### L. L. Zamehof

> Any insult or oppression of a man because he belongs to another race, another language or another social class than me, I regard as barbaric.

> L. L. Zamehof in Homaranismo

### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, Yahweh explores a way to handle Earthly economics which he tentatively named Humanitarniasm. The first paragraph of the New Commadment called Humanitarniasm goes as follows:

> Second point: Your world is paralyzed by profit, and Communism fails to provide a carrot big enough to motivate people and encourage them to make progress.
>
> You are all born equal; this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that children of low intelligence should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their fathers, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.
>
> This way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.
>
> This world is not yours - that also is written in the Bible. You are only tenants. Thus all goods should be rented for forty-nine years.
>
> This will eliminate the injustice of inheritance. Your true inheritance, and that of your children, is the entire world, if you knew how to organize yourselves to make it pleasant. This political orientation of humanity is not Communism; its preoccupation is the future of humanity. If you want to give it a name, call it "Humanitarianism".

### Left-libertarianism and the Steiner-Vallentyne school

> Left-libertarians of the Steinerâ€“Vallentyne type hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others. These left-libertarians support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources. Unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is only legitimate if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or if private appropriation is taxed to compensate those who are excluded from natural resources.
