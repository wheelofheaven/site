The swastika is a symbol that has been used for thousands of years in various cultures and traditions. It typically consists of a cross with arms that bend at a right angle in one or both directions. The symbol is most commonly associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, where it is considered to be a symbol of good luck, prosperity, and auspiciousness.

The origin of the swastika is considered uncertain, but it has been found in archaeological remains and artifacts from many cultures and civilizations dating back thousands of years, including ancient Greece, China, and the Indus Valley Civilization. In Hinduism, the swastika is considered to be a symbol of the sun, and is used to represent the idea of cyclical change, or the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth.

However, the swastika is also infamous for its use by the Nazi party in Germany as the symbol of their ideology of racism and antisemitism. During World War II, the swastika became a symbol of Nazi power and aggression, and it is now widely associated with hatred and intolerance.

Due to its historical association with the Nazi regime, the display of the swastika is illegal in many countries and its use is restricted in others. In many Western countries, the swastika is widely seen as a symbol of hate and is strongly discouraged.
