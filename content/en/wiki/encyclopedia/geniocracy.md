Geniocracy is a political philosophy that proposes that government should be run by people with intelligence as the most important factor in their selection. The term was first coined by Raoul Vaneigem in the 20th century and is based on the idea that intelligence is a better indicator of a person's ability to govern than their social status, wealth, or political affiliation.

According to geniocracy, intelligence should be measured objectively and used as the primary criteria for selecting politicians and government officials. This philosophy aims to create a society in which intelligent individuals have the power to make decisions for the betterment of all, rather than just for a privileged few.

It should be noted that geniocracy is a controversial and largely untested idea, and there are many questions about how intelligence would be measured and how such a system would be implemented in practice. Despite this, the idea of geniocracy continues to be discussed and debated in political and philosophical circles.

### Raoul Vaneigem

Raoul Vaneigem is a Belgian philosopher and writer who first explored the idea of geniocracy in his writings. He was a member of the Situationist International, a political and artistic movement active in the mid-20th century that aimed to challenge dominant social and cultural structures.

Vaneigem's ideas on geniocracy were first published in the Situationist International's journal and later expanded upon in his book "The Revolution of Everyday Life." In this book, he argues that the traditional political and economic systems have failed and that a new system, based on intelligence, is needed to ensure the well-being of society.

Vaneigem's ideas on geniocracy have had a lasting impact on political and philosophical thought and continue to be discussed and debated in various circles.
