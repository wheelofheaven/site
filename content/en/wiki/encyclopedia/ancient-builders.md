title: "Ancient Builders"
description: "Ancient Builders, sometimes also referred to simply as the Builder Race, the proposition that an unknown number of co-existing or successive builder civilizations are reponsible for having built long-lasting, hyper-resilient architectural structures that have lasted for at least thousand of years. While these structures may or may not have been built by the same civilization, they can be characterized as having been built by ancient builders by a number of peculiar fingerprints such as megalithic building elements, the polygonial interlocking of these elements and astronomical alignements."
