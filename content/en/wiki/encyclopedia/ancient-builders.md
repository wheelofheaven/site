description: "Ancient Builders, sometimes also referred to simply as the Builder Race, the proposition that an unknown number of co-existing or successive builder civilizations are reponsible for having built long-lasting, hyper-resilient architectural structures that have lasted for at least thousand of years. While these structures may or may not have been built by the same civilization, they can be characterized as having been built by ancient builders by a number of peculiar fingerprints such as megalithic building elements, the polygonial interlocking of these elements and astronomical alignements."

Ancient Builders typically refers to the architects, engineers, and skilled workers who created structures, such as buildings, temples, pyramids, and other monumental structures, in ancient civilizations. These ancient builders used a variety of materials and techniques, depending on the resources and technological abilities available to them. They often incorporated elements of sacred geometry, religious beliefs, and cultural symbols into their structures, which were sometimes used for religious or political purposes.

Examples of ancient builders include the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan temples, the Parthenon in Greece, and the Roman Colosseum, among many others. These ancient builders have had a lasting impact on architecture and engineering, inspiring and influencing later generations of architects, engineers, and builders.

The notion of Ancient Builders is usually understood within the realm of an alleged Ancient Builder race. It refers to the idea that a lost or unknown race of highly advanced people existed in the distant past and were responsible for constructing many of the ancient structures and monuments found around the world.

Proponents of this idea argue that these structures, such as pyramids, stone circles, and megaliths, are too complex and sophisticated to have been built by the civilizations that are known to have lived in the areas where they are found. They suggest that this ancient race may have had advanced knowledge of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy, and that they left behind evidence of their existence in the form of these structures.
