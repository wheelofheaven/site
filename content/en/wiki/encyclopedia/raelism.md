He gradually adopted the name Raël and wrote down the dialogues that happened during all the encounters in a number of books that anyone can read today. The premise of the Raëlian faith is that most religions are witnessing the doings of a god-like advanced extraterrestrial civilization that terraformed Earth some 25'000 years ago and subsequently synthetically created life on Earth as described in the Biblical Genesis and other creation myths."

Raëlism is a religious and philosophical movement that originated in France in the 1970s. It is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim created life on Earth and continue to interact with humanity. The founder of Raëlism, Claude Vorilhon, also known as Raël, claims that he had a series of encounters with a being from another planet who gave him messages to share with the world.

According to Raëlian beliefs, the Elohim are highly advanced beings who used their genetic engineering skills to create humans and other species. Raelians believe that all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, have their origins in ancient extraterrestrial visitations, and that the Elohim are the gods described in various mythologies.

The Raëlian movement emphasizes individual freedom and tolerance, and seeks to promote peace and understanding among people of all cultures and religions. They also advocate for scientific and technological advancements, such as cloning, as a means of improving human life and creating a better future for all.

While Raëlism has gained a significant following in some countries, it is considered a controversial and non-mainstream movement by many. Critics argue that the beliefs and claims of Raëlism are unsupported by scientific evidence, and that it represents a form of new age spirituality or pseudoscience.

## Etymology

As stated in his book _The Book Which Tells The Truth_, Claude Vorhilon is making converstation with Yahweh and Yahweh says the following about what Raël means:

> You, Claude Vorilhon, you will spread the truth under your present name, which you will replace progressively with RAEL, which means literally “light of God” and if we translate it more accurately, “light of the Elohim” or “Ambassador of the Elohim”, because you will be our ambassador on Earth, and we will come only officially to your Embassy. RAEL can be simply translated as “messenger”.

In this passage, Yahweh, as the representative of the Elohimian civilization, asks Claude Vorhilon to be their messenger. _RAEL_, capitalized in the writings, is a denomination composed of two separate words: Ra and El. Ra as the first compound is explained to mean "light". This meaning can be derived from the Afro-Asiatic Egyptian rꜥ, Sun.[^1] El as the second compound is explained to stand for the Elohim, where Elohim designate the beings that come from the Sky, the ones from Above, the Heavens.[^2] Combining these two compounds, as suggested by Yahweh himself, would lead to the meaning of "the light of those who come from the sky", the ambassador or messenger of the parent civilization that created life on Earth and are still in touch with the developments on planet Earth.
