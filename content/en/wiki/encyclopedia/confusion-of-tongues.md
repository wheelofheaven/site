### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh mentions the confusion of tongues and says the following about what happened:

> They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.
>
>> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.
>>
>> â€” Genesis 11: 7-8.
>
> So they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.
