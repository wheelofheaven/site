Cyberparadism is a subgenre of Cyberprep and Post-Cyberpunk, combining cybernetic themes with aspects of paradise. This can be portrayed as a utopian society or a literal paradise, such as a Garden of Eden. It diverges from Cyberprep by not just focusing on the benefits of technological advancement, but also showcasing how technology has significantly altered economic principles and labor, encouraging the pursuit of higher goals in science, technology, civilization, and spirituality.

Societal structures in Cyberparadism reflect this pursuit, with highly interconnected small communities or dense urban pods working together towards common objectives, such as environmental conservation or scientific advancement. This cooperative emphasis is a distinguishing feature of Cyberparadism and is facilitated by the advanced technology of a post-scarcity society.

In Cyberparadism, the paradisal aspect is more than an aesthetic, it is central to the philosophy of the subgenre. It envisions a future where technology enhances and safeguards the natural world, advocating a sustainable, fulfilling, and purposeful future. It refutes the notion that progress necessitates environmental degradation, instead proposing a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature.

In short, Cyberparadism is an aesthetic that merges nature, often tropical or jungle-like, with a small civilization utilizing advanced technology for survival or luxury, promoting a quasi-hedonistic lifestyle. It frequently explores themes such as genetic engineering, terraformation, and space frontiers.

## As an aesthetic

An aesthetic refers to a distinctive style or appearance that characterizes a particular form of art, design, or culture. It often involves visual elements but can also include themes, values, and feelings associated with a specific era, group, or concept. As an aesthetic, Cyberparadism encapsulates a visual style, thematic elements, and a set of values that can be used to represent and communicate its underlying philosophy. It's not just about how a setting or a piece of art looks, but also what it represents and conveys.

Visually, Cyberparadism often combines the elements of advanced technology with lush, untamed natural settings. This can include depictions of futuristic, high-tech cities nestled in a jungle, or small, minimalist societies that have used technology to live sustainably in harmony with nature. The imagery used in Cyberparadism often serves to highlight the coexistence of advanced technology and pristine nature, portraying a future where technology has allowed humans to live in harmony with the environment.

Thematically, Cyberparadism explores positive use of technology, sustainable living, cooperation, and the pursuit of higher goals and pleasures in life. These themes are often reflected in the narratives, characters, and societies that are depicted within the Cyberparadism aesthetic.

In terms of values, Cyberparadism promotes harmony with nature, technological progress for the betterment of society, and a balance between technological advancement and environmental preservation. It challenges the notion of progress at the expense of the environment, advocating instead for a future where technology and nature coexist and thrive together.

Thus, as an aesthetic, Cyberparadism is a way of visualizing and embodying a specific set of themes and values. It's a tool for expressing a particular vision of the future—one that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable, and deeply fulfilling for its inhabitants.

## Depiction in media

There are a few movies that can be mentioned that each depict elements of the Cyberparadism aesthetic:

- "Jurassic World" (2015): In this movie, the theme park, which is filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs, is a prime example of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. The park represents an advanced use of technology, in this case genetic engineering, to recreate prehistoric life forms and coexist with them in a lush, tropical environment. It blends the untamed wilderness of the past with the high-tech reality of the present, making it a paradisal place despite the inherent dangers.

- "Elysium" (2013): The orbital ring-world Elysium depicts a different form of Cyberparadism. This space habitat is filled with beautiful landscapes, luxury homes, and highly advanced medical technology that can cure all diseases, representing a sort of utopia or paradise. However, the paradisal aspect is only available to the wealthy, leading to social inequality, which contradicts the egalitarian principles usually associated with Cyberparadism. Still, the aesthetic can be seen in the combination of advanced technology and an idyllic living environment.

- "Oblivion" (2013): In the beginning scenes of the movie, the protagonist lives in a high-tech tower above the clouds, with a stunning view of the earth below. This represents a form of Cyberparadism in the sense that he lives in a highly advanced dwelling, with sophisticated technology, above a desolate Earth. The harmony with nature is achieved by leaving nature thrive on its own having a habitats that are well isolated form nature and fusion energy generators deployed on top the oceans.
