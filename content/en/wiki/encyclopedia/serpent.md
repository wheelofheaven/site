The Biblical Serpent refers to a serpent mentioned in the book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the biblical story, the serpent was a creature that appeared in the Garden of Eden and tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. This event is often seen as the first act of sin and disobedience, and is believed to have caused humanity to fall from a state of innocence and purity into a state of sin and mortality.

The identity of the serpent has been the subject of much interpretation and debate throughout history. In some interpretations, the serpent is seen as a symbol of evil and temptation, while in others it is viewed as a representation of the cunning and deceptive nature of the Devil or Satan.

In Christian tradition, the serpent is often associated with the idea of the fall of man, and is often used as a metaphor for sin and evil in the world. The serpent is also mentioned in the New Testament, where it is identified as the Devil or Satan, and is seen as a symbol of the opposition to God and the forces of evil in the world.

### In Raëlism 🔯

the Serpent refers to a group of scientists led by Lucifer who revealed the true nature of the creators to the first humans, which ultimately led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

According to the _Book Which Tells The Truth_, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of engineering Elohim disobeyed and came to be known as the Serpent:

> Some scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their "creatures", and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.
>
>> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.
>>
>> — Genesis 3: 7.
>
> The new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their "parents" for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.
>
>> And Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, 'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed... upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.'
>>
>>— Genesis 3: 14.
>
> The "serpent" was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.

In this passage, a team of scientists on Earth create human beings who are almost as intelligent as their creators. However, the creators are cautious and keep the scientific books away from the young human beings, wanting to ensure they don't surpass their own knowledge. But some of the creators take pity on the humans and decide to give them a complete education so that they too can become scientists. The humans become angry with their "parents" for keeping them in ignorance, and the creators who tried to help them are cursed and exiled to Earth. The "serpent" referred to in the Bible is actually this small group of creators who wanted to share knowledge with the humans.
