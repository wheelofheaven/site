### In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

Elijah is mentioned multiple times by Yahweh during their encounter with RaÃ«l. The following reference from Rael's first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth ([see here](https://wheelofheaven.github.io/rael-one-the-book-which-tells-the-truth/3_watching_over_the_chosen_people.html#samson-the-telepathist), showcases the first mentioning of Elijah as follows:

> In Samuel, Chapter 3, we find Elijah initiating Samuel into telepathy. The creators wanted to contact Samuel, and he thinks that Elijah is speaking to him. He "hears voices":
>
>> Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Yahweh; for thy servant heareth.
>>
>> â€” 1 Samuel 3: 9.
>
> This is a little like the behavior of amateur radio operators who might say, "Go ahead, I can hear you loud and clear". And the telepathic conversation begins:
>
>> 'Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel answered, 'Speak; for thy servant heareth.'
>>
>> â€” 1 Samuel 3: 10-11.

Later on, in the following chapter named after Elijah ([see here](https://wheelofheaven.github.io/rael-one-the-book-which-tells-the-truth/3_watching_over_the_chosen_people.html#elijah-the-messenger)), Elijah The Messenger, this is being said about him:

> The creators paid particular attention to Elijah.
>
>> Then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.
>>
>> â€” 1 Kings 19: 5-6.
