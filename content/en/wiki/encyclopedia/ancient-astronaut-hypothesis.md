description: "Ancient astronaut hypothesis, also known as ancient aliens, the idea that extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in the past and influenced ancient cultures and civilizations. This hypothesis suggests that many ancient structures and artifacts, such as pyramids and sacred objekts like the Ark of the Convenant, were created with the help of extraterrestrial beings and were intended to convey messages about the nature of the universe and our place within it. Proponents of the hypothesis also point to legends, myths, and religious texts from various cultures that describe encounters with beings from the stars."
