### The Logic of the Biblical Text

In his 1970 book, The Coming of the Gods, Jean Sendy writes the following about what conditions need to be met to make introduce his exegetical reading into the Bible: 

> To make the Biblical text appear with the relief and coherence of a hologram, there are four conditions to be met: first, you must know the Bible; second, you must know the possibilities and limitations of astronautics within the framework of today's physics; third, you must have some clear and recent knowledge, even if it is elementary, of biology, prehistory, history, and evolution; and fourth, you must reject any "explanation by the inexplicable", that is, any intrusion of the supernatural.
>
> There is also a fifth condition, an implicit one: you must have accepted the assumption of a universe intelligible to human reason.
>
> — page 182

### The Five Conditions

The five conditions that Sendy mentions in his book can be seen as a blueprint on how to determine what conditions need to be met to assert the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible:

1. Familiarity with the contents of the Bible
2. Familiarity with the current state of space science, in particular spaceflight
3. Firm comprehension of a variety of scientific notions in biology, prehistory, history and evolution
4. Repudiation of the supernatural
5. Assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason
