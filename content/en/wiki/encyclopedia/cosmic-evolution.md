It transcends biological evolution, emphasizing deliberate design and continual refinement of humanoid life forms. Each successive creation represents an evolutionary step forward, although potentially posing a threat to their creators. This concept represents a blend of natural processes and conscious design in the grand progression of life across the cosmos."

## In RaÃ«lism ðŸ”¯

"Cosmic evolution," as depicted in RaÃ«lism, transcends the traditional understanding of evolution being a solely natural and biological process. Here, evolution also embodies the notion of an iterative and deliberate progression in the creation of intelligent life forms - a process consciously driven by these cosmic creators, from the Forerunners to the Elohim.

This process, as described in the quoted passage from The Book Which Tells The Truth, has seen each subsequent creation of a humanoid civilization incorporating gradual improvements, an act akin to an artist refining their technique with each new masterpiece. The creators, starting from the Forerunners, continuously honed their knowledge and techniques, enabling them to create increasingly sophisticated life forms over time.

Each new version of 'humanity' is a testament to this iterative refinement, reflecting small enhancements that contribute to a grand process of evolution across the cosmos. This 'designed evolution' differs from natural evolution in its purposefulness and speed, being not a product of random mutations and natural selection over eons, but a result of deliberate design and creation.

Moreover, this evolution is not only physical but also intellectual and cultural. The creators didn't just aspire to perfect the physical forms of their creations, but also to imbue them with increased intelligence and the capacity for sophisticated thought. They aimed to create beings who would not only survive but also thrive, appreciate their origins, and potentially continue this lineage of creation themselves.

However, this 'cosmic evolution' also involves an element of risk. As creations become more advanced, they might pose a potential threat to their creators. This concern underlies the Elohim's hesitations about humanity on Earth, which is seen as possibly being slightly superior to their fathers. Despite this, the majority of the Elohim hope that humanity will prove its worthiness of the heritage it has received.

In conclusion, this model of 'cosmic evolution' depicts an intriguing blend of natural processes and deliberate design, highlighting the progression and potential of life not just on Earth, but across the cosmos. It presents a vision where intelligent life forms, starting from the Forerunners, have continually refined and enhanced life's blueprint, contributing to a grand, cosmic lineage of creators and creations.

## Abiogenesis

Cosmic evolution doesn't answer the problem of the origins of life itself, so-called abiogenesis.
