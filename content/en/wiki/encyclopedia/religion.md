title: "Religion"
description: "Religion, a set of practices and beliefs that cultivates and teaches the connection (from Latin _religare_, to 'connect again') between the Human people on Earth and the Elohim, our progenitors and creators of life on Earth. Very much like the relationship between the parents and their children is a bond that needs culivation and reverence, a religion is meant to maintain the link between the creators and the created. A religion that does not strive to cultivate and rationalize that bond of gratitude towards the ones who created us is a different socio-cultural system altogether."
