Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary field of study that investigates the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. It combines knowledge from astronomy, biology, geology, and other sciences to understand the conditions necessary for life to exist, both on Earth and elsewhere. To research the possibility of extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists use various techniques and tools such as searching for evidence of past or present life on other planets, moons, or asteroids in our solar system, looking for signs of life on exoplanets around other stars, and studying the chemical and physical conditions necessary for life to form and survive. This research helps us to better understand our place in the universe and answer one of the most fundamental questions in science: are we alone in the universe?

The methods of astrobiology include:

- Observational astronomy
- Laboratory simulations and experiments
- In situ measurements and sample analysis (e.g. from missions to other planets)
- Theoretical modeling and computer simulations
- Analysis of meteorites and other extraterrestrial materials
- Study of Earth's extremophiles and their potential habitability elsewhere.

## Requirements for proof of evidence

Findings that would be considered strong indications of extraterrestrial life would include the discovery of a reliable and repeatable proof of the following conditions:

- The existence of organic compounds, a key building block of life, beyond Earth.
- The presence of liquid water, a vital requirement for life as we know it.
- Evidence of metabolic activity or biogenic substances produced by living organisms.
- The detection of radio or optical signals that are indicative of intelligence.

## Carl Sagan

Carl Sagan made the following statement in his book "Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space" published in 1994.

> Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring–not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.

The quote implies that space exploration and colonization is necessary for the survival of humanity in the long run. Sagan argues that the threat of impacts from space is a natural and inevitable danger that every civilization must eventually face, and becoming a spacefaring civilization is the only way to protect ourselves from this threat and ensure the survival of our species.
