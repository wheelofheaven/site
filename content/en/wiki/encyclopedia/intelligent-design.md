Intelligent Design (ID) is a theory that suggests that certain features of the natural world, particularly in biology and biochemistry, are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than by natural selection or other purely naturalistic processes. Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that the complexity and apparent design found in the natural world provide evidence of a supernatural designer, often referred to as a "intelligent agent," that is responsible for the creation and development of life.

Intelligent Design differs from traditional creationism, which asserts that the universe and all life were created by God in six literal 24-hour days, in that it does not make specific claims about the identity or nature of the intelligent agent responsible for the design in the natural world.

Intelligent Design has been the subject of much controversy and criticism, particularly in the scientific community. Critics argue that ID is not a scientifically valid explanation for the natural world, as it does not provide testable hypotheses or make predictions that can be verified through empirical observation. Additionally, ID is often seen as a political and religious movement rather than a scientific theory, and many have argued that its ultimate goal is to introduce religious concepts into science classrooms.

As a result of these criticisms, Intelligent Design is not widely accepted in the scientific community and is not taught as a scientific theory in public schools. However, it continues to be a topic of discussion and debate among scientists, philosophers, and religious scholars.
