**Maintainer of and main contributor to Wheel of Heaven.**

While I was overlooking the rooftops of Jerusalem during a sunset that was very close to the autumn equinox in 2022, I had the idea to formalize what was ruminating in mind for a long time.

A web presence that would elaborate and catalogue all informations concerning a very speculative hypothesis: namely the hypothesis that Earthly life got scientifically engineered by an extraterrestrial civilization who we remember in Biblical terms as the Elohim. A proposition that is also sustained by a contemporary new religious movement known as RaÃ«lism.
