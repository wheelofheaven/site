**Maintainer of and main contributor to Wheel of Heaven.**

While I was overlooking the rooftops of Jerusalem during a sunset that was very close to the autumn equinox in 2022, I had the idea to formalize what was ruminating in mind for a long time.

The idea was to build a web knowledge base about a subject that had not equivalent up to that point on the web, at least not that I had known of. A web presence that would elaborate and catalogue all information concerning a very speculative hypothesis: namely the hypothesis that Earthly life got scientifically engineered by an extraterrestrial civilization who we remember through Biblical sciptures as the Elohim. A proposition that is also sustained by a contemporary new religious movement known as RaÃ«lism.

When not writing directly for and contributing to Wheel of Heaven, I might be writing down new ideas and discoveries in my [digital garden](https://zarazinsfuss.github.io/quartz/).

Here is an AI altered rendering of me:
