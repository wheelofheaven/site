An academicarchive essay by two authors, namely Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechedn, about history and comparative mythology, particularly the subfield of archaeoastronomy. It is mostly about the claim of a Megalithic era discovery of axial precession and the encoding of this knowledge in mythology.
