"La Bibbia non è un libro sacro" (The Bible is Not a Sacred Book) is a book by Italian scholar Mauro Biglino, which challenges the traditional understanding of the Bible. In the book, Biglino argues that the texts of the Old Testament, specifically the Torah, were not divinely inspired, but rather were written by ancient scribes who recorded the history and beliefs of their society. He claims that the text has been mistranslated and misinterpreted over time, and that a more accurate understanding of the Bible would reveal that it is not a divine text, but rather a historical document that reflects the cultural and political context of its authors.

Biglino's work has been controversial and his claims have been met with criticism and opposition by many in the religious community. While some have welcomed his perspectives and approach, others have accused him of promoting a secular and secularist agenda. Despite the debate surrounding his work, "La Bibbia non è un libro sacro" has been widely read and discussed, and has had a significant impact on the way some people view and understand the Bible.
