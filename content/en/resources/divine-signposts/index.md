"Divine Signposts" (大本, Ōmoto) by Onisaburo Deguchi (出口王仁三郎) is a foundational text in the spiritual and religious tradition of Ōmoto (大本), a Japanese new religious movement. Written in 1904 when Onisaburo was 33 years old, this work is one of his earliest writings and consists of 14 volumes. It lays out the basis of Ōmoto's teachings, emphasizing the essence of faith and Onisaburo's mission of world salvation.

This sacred text is intended to be read by Ōmoto believers as a part of their daily spiritual practice, serving as both a doctrinal book and a guide to true faith. It addresses the mission of world salvation and various other matters in simple terms for the believers of that time.

The origins of Ōmoto, as detailed in "Divine Signposts," trace back to the divine revelations received by Deguchi Nao (出口なお), the Foundress of Ōmoto, and Onisaburo's spiritual awakening and mission. These revelations, known as "Fudesaki" (筆先), contain prophecies and warnings about the demolition and reconstruction of the world, positioning Ōmoto as a vehicle for global salvation.

"Divine Signposts" encapsulates the dual foundational elements of Ōmoto's doctrine, aligning with the warp function (God’s plan for the future) as explained by the Foundress and the weft (earthly salvation) as elucidated by Onisaburo. This text is crucial for understanding the spiritual narrative of Ōmoto, offering insights into the relationship between God and humans, the destiny of Gods and gods, and the reconstruction of the phenomenal world.

As a sacred text, "Divine Signposts" is revered within the Ōmoto community and is considered essential reading for followers and those interested in understanding the depth and breadth of Ōmoto's spiritual teachings​.

### About Deguchi Onisaburō

Deguchi Onisaburō (出口 王仁三郎), born in 1871 and passing away in 1948, was a central figure in the development of the Ōmoto (大本) religion, a new religious movement in Japan. He is widely known for his work "Divine Signposts," considered a foundational text for Ōmoto. This religion, emerging in the early 20th century, is characterized by its syncretic approach, blending Shinto, Buddhism, and elements of other religious traditions, along with a strong emphasis on world peace and the spiritual unity of humanity.

Onisaburō's influence on Ōmoto was profound. He transformed the group from a small religious community into a significant spiritual movement. Under his guidance, Ōmoto adopted various social reform initiatives and became involved in international peace efforts. His teachings emphasized the importance of artistic expression and the spiritual development of the individual, advocating a world free from materialism and conflict.

His life and work, however, were not without controversy. Onisaburō and the Ōmoto movement faced persecution from the Japanese government, primarily due to their pacifist stance and criticism of the state's militarism. This persecution culminated in multiple government crackdowns, including the Ōmoto Incident of 1935, where Onisaburō and other leaders were arrested.

### About Ōmoto

Ōmoto (大本), also known as Ōmoto-kyō, is a Japanese new religious movement that originated in the late 19th century. Founded by Deguchi Nao (出口 直) in 1892, and later significantly shaped by her son-in-law, Deguchi Onisaburō (出口 王仁三郎), the movement is rooted in Shinto, the indigenous faith of Japan, but also incorporates elements from Buddhism, Christianity, and other religious and philosophical traditions. Ōmoto's teachings emphasize the importance of world peace, spiritual enlightenment, and the artistic expression of faith.

Ōmoto's theology centers on the belief in a supreme deity, Ushitora no Konjin, who communicates divine will through spiritual mediums. Nao began the movement after experiencing what she believed to be spiritual revelations from this deity. Onisaburō expanded on these teachings, promoting a universalist message that sought to harmonize all religions and foster world peace. He also emphasized the importance of art and culture in spiritual life, which led to the establishment of cultural institutions under the auspices of Ōmoto.

The movement experienced rapid growth in the early 20th century, attracting followers with its message of spiritual renewal and social reform. However, its critical stance against militarism and the Japanese government's policies led to severe persecution, notably during the Ōmoto Incident of 1935, when government forces suppressed the movement, arresting many of its leaders including Onisaburō.

Despite these setbacks, Ōmoto survived and continued to influence religious and cultural life in Japan. Today, it remains active, promoting its teachings on spiritual enlightenment and peace, and engaging in various cultural and educational activities. Ōmoto's influence extends beyond its religious practices, contributing to discussions on interfaith dialogue, peacebuilding, and the role of religion in modern society. Its history reflects broader themes in Japanese religious history, including the tension between new religious movements and state authority, and the ongoing evolution of Shinto in the modern era.
