Terranigma, developed by Quintet (株式会社クインテット) and published by Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), is a 1995 action role-playing game with a rich narrative and thematic depth. The game's story centers around Ark, a mischievous teenager from the underground village of Crysta. Ark's journey begins when his curiosity triggers a series of events leading to the resurrection of life on a previously barren Earth.

The game unfolds across four main chapters. In the first chapter, Ark's actions cause the inhabitants of his village to be frozen, and he must revive them. This sets him on a quest that spans the resurrection of the entire world, including continents, plants, animals, and eventually, human civilization.

In the second chapter, "Resurrection of the World," Ark travels across the Earth, reviving various aspects of the natural world, such as plants, birds, and animals. His journey includes freeing a giant tree from a parasite and encountering a Lightside twin of a character from his village.

The third chapter, "Resurrection of the Genius," sees Ark aiding humanity's growth and technological advancements. He encounters and revives Beruga, a scientist from the previous world, who has a dystopian vision of paradise. The chapter culminates in a revelation about Ark's role in the plans of Dark Gaia, a devil-like entity, leading to a near-death experience for Ark.

The final chapter, "Resurrection of the Hero," involves Ark's rebirth and ultimate battle against Dark Gaia and the scientist Beruga. The game concludes with Ark realizing his fate as a creation of Dark Gaia, destined to vanish with its defeat. However, the ending implies a form of reincarnation for Ark and his loved ones from Crysta.

### Etymology

The original title of the SNES game "Terranigma," 天地創造 (Tenchi Sōzō), translates to "The Creation of Heaven and Earth" in English. This title not only encapsulates the game's overarching themes of creation and resurrection but also bears a striking resemblance to the name of the first book of the Bible, Genesis. In the Biblical context, Genesis details the creation of the world, including the heavens and the earth, which aligns with the game's narrative of reviving a barren Earth and re-establishing life in various forms. The parallel in names underscores the fundamental concept of creation and beginning, central to both the game's storyline and the Biblical text.

### Development and release

"Terranigma" is noted for its unique themes of creation and resurrection, contrasting the traditional destruction focus of other action titles. The game was part of an unofficial trilogy by Quintet, often referred to as the "Quintet Trilogy," "Soul Trilogy," "Gaia Trilogy," or "Heaven and Earth Trilogy."

The game's development involved a collaboration of talented individuals, including director and designer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki, scenario writer Reiko Takebayashi, and character designer Kamui Fujiwara. The music was composed by Miyoko Takaoka and Masanori Hikichi, adding to the game's immersive experience.

Though "Terranigma" was not released in North America, it became a beloved classic in regions where it was available, such as Japan and Europe. The game's innovative gameplay, combined with its profound narrative, has cemented its place as a significant title in the SNES library.
