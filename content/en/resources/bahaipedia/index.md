### About Baháʼí Faith

The Baháʼí Faith, founded by Bahá’u’lláh in the 19th century, is a world religion centered on the principle of the oneness of humanity and the unity of all major religions. It promotes peace, justice, and equality, emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind. Key teachings include the unity of God, the essential worth of all religions, and the unity of humanity. Baháʼís believe in progressive revelation, asserting that Bahá’u’lláh is the most recent in a line of messengers from God, which includes figures like Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad. The faith has a significant emphasis on social and ethical values, striving for community building and global advancement.
