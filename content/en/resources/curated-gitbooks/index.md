Wheel of Heaven believes in the democratization of information and is interested in maintaining and hosting as many original sources as possible.

As a result, we are pleased to provide a **small subset of books** that we deem important for the proper propagation and contextualization of the premises proposed by Wheel of Heaven. These books are all accessible as so-called Gitbooks, which means that these books are versioned and hosted with the infamous Git technology, a distributed version control system.

You don't have to fully understand what the use of Git all implies, just go ahead and the read the books for yourself.

#### Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969)

An academic essay by two authors, namely Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechedn, about history and comparative mythology, particularly the subfield of archaeoastronomy. It is mostly about the claim of a Megalithic era discovery of axial precession and the encoding of this knowledge in mythology.
