"The Kabbalah: Law and Mysticism in the Jewish Tradition" (simply "La Kabbale" in French, its original title) by Alexandre Safran is a comprehensive exploration of Jewish mysticism and tradition, transcending a purely analytical study of Jewish esotericism. The book offers a complete and harmonious vision of the Hebrew tradition, tracing its evolution from its beginnings to the present day. Safran highlights the unity and continuity within Jewish tradition, emphasizing how divisions between law and freedom, intelligence and sensitivity, appear artificial in the context of Kabbalah. He discusses the integration of matter and spirit, and nature and history, portraying them as inherent and self-evident unions.

Safran's approach to understanding and explaining Kabbalah does not rely solely on critical methods or external investigation. Instead, he seeks to reveal the essence or "soul" of the Kabbalah, achieving this through a combination of intuition and rigorous scientific discipline. This synthesis results in a holistic understanding of reality as presented in Kabbalistic teachings.

"La Kabbale" represents a significant work of synthesis in an area where mere critical methods are insufficient. It is an essential read for those interested in delving deeply into the intricacies of Kabbalistic thought and the broader spectrum of Jewish mystical tradition​.


### About Alexandre Safran

Alexandre Safran was a distinguished Romanian-born rabbi, philosopher, and scholar, deeply rooted in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalistic teachings. Born in 1910 in Bacău, Romania, he became the Chief Rabbi of Romania during a turbulent period for the Jewish community, notably during World War II. A vocal advocate for the rights and protection of Jews during the Holocaust, Safran worked tirelessly to save thousands of lives, often engaging in diplomatic efforts with authorities and the church.

After the war, Safran continued his religious and scholarly pursuits, eventually moving to Geneva, Switzerland, where he served as the Chief Rabbi. His scholarly work is characterized by a deep understanding of Jewish mysticism, philosophy, and the Kabbalah, which he explored and elucidated in his writings, including "La Kabbale" ("The Kabbalah"). Safran's approach combined rigorous academic study with a profound spiritual insight, making his contributions to Jewish thought and Kabbalistic scholarship both unique and significant. He passed away in 2006, leaving behind a legacy as a spiritual leader, a defender of human rights, and an esteemed scholar in Jewish mystical traditions.
