The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, known as "The Most Holy Book," is the central book of the Bahá'í Faith, written by Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the faith. Composed in the 19th century, this sacred text lays down the laws, principles, and institutions for the Bahá'í community, and is considered the charter for a future global civilization.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas not only provides laws and ordinances for the spiritual and daily life of believers but also articulates the administrative principles and structures of the Bahá'í Faith. It outlines the requirements for the election of the Universal House of Justice, the faith's highest governing body, and sets forth the principles for the administration of Bahá'í communities.

One of the central themes of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the unity of humanity, reflecting Bahá’u’lláh's vision of a world characterized by peace and harmony. The book emphasizes the importance of justice, equality, and education, and abolishes various practices such as asceticism, monasticism, and mendicancy. It calls for the elimination of prejudices, the equality of men and women, the compulsory education of children, and the harmony of science and religion.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas also introduces several specific laws and rituals, including the requirements for prayer, fasting, marriage, and the disposal of the dead. It abolishes certain Islamic legal practices, reaffirms the validity of some laws from previous religious dispensations, and introduces new laws.

The book is notable for its blend of mysticism and law, combining the metaphysical aspects of religion with practical directives. It is written in a poetic and symbolic style, typical of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, making it a subject of ongoing study and interpretation within the Bahá'í community.

As the cornerstone of Bahá'í law and ethics, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas plays a critical role in shaping the moral and social framework of the Bahá'í community worldwide. Its teachings on global peace, unity, and justice continue to inspire followers of the Bahá'í Faith and contribute to discussions on religious law, governance, and the betterment of society.

### Contents and structure

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, authored by Bahá’u’lláh, is a central book of Bahá'í laws, composed around 1873 in Arabic during his imprisonment in ‘Akká. This text was later augmented with additional writings and answers to questions posed by a secretary. The first authorized English translation, released in 1992, was annotated and included these supplementary writings and a question-and-answer section​.

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, initiated the Synopsis and Codification of the laws and ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1953, aiming to prepare it for translation. Although he passed away in 1957 before completion, the work was continued and published in 1973. This volume encompassed both the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and its Questions and Answers appendix, and its English translation was completed as part of a Six Year Plan from 1986 to 1992​.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is structured to facilitate reading and understanding. Paragraph divisions, uncommon in Arabic literature, have been added for clarity, ease of access, and consistency across translations​
​. The text is followed by supplementary writings of Bahá’u’lláh and a first-time translation of the Questions and Answers​​. Annotations in the English version focus on clarifying points that may be obscure to non-Arabic readers, without intending to be a comprehensive commentary​​. The notes are sequentially numbered, each linked to a specific passage in the text for easy cross-referencing​​. Additionally, an index is provided to navigate subjects throughout the volume​​.
