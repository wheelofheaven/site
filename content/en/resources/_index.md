Wheel of Heaven believes in the democratization of information and is interested in maintaining and hosting as many original sources as possible.

As a result, we are pleased to provide a **small subset of books** that we deem important for the proper propagation and contextualization of the premises proposed by Wheel of Heaven. These books are all accessible as so-called Gitbooks, which means that these books are versioned and hosted with the infamous Git technology, a distributed version control system.
