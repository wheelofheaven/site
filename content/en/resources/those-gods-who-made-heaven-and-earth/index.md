"Those Gods Who Made Heaven and Earth: The Evidence for Alien Visitors to Earth before the Dawn of History" is a book written by Jean Sendy, a French author and researcher. The book presents the author's views on the origins of ancient cultures and their possible connection to extraterrestrial visitors. According to Sendy, there is evidence that aliens have visited the Earth in the past, and that they have influenced the development of human civilizations, shaping the religious beliefs and practices of ancient peoples.

The book argues that many of the myths, legends, and religious texts of ancient cultures contain references to extraterrestrial visitors, and that these references can be understood as evidence of real encounters between humans and aliens. Sendy asserts that ancient cultures like the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Mayans had knowledge and technology that far exceeded their apparent level of development, and that this can only be explained by the influence of extraterrestrial visitors.

Sendy also examines various archaeological and architectural sites, such as the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, as evidence of alien influence. He argues that these sites were constructed with technologies and knowledge beyond the abilities of the cultures that built them, and that they may have served as landing sites or communication centers for extraterrestrial visitors.

The book has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some accepting the author's claims as credible, while others have criticized them as speculative and unsupported by mainstream science. Regardless, "Those Gods Who Made Heaven and Earth" remains a popular and widely discussed work in the field of ufology and alternative archaeology.
