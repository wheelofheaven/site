lead: "In Wonders in the Sky, respected researchers Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck examine more than 500 selected reports of sightings from biblical-age antiquity through the year 1879-the point at which the Industrial Revolution deeply changed the nature of human society, and the skies began to open to airplanes, dirigibles, rockets, and other opportunities for misinterpretation represented by military prototypes. Using vivid and engaging case studies, and more than seventy-five illustrations, they reveal that unidentified flying objects have had a major impact not only on popular culture but on our history, on our religion, and on the models of the world humanity has formed from deepest antiquity."

"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times" is a book by Jacques Vallée and Chris Aubeck that explores the history of sightings and reports of unexplained aerial objects throughout history. The authors examine accounts of strange objects in the sky from ancient civilizations, medieval times, and up to the present day, with a focus on patterns and themes that emerge in the data.

The book covers a wide range of incidents and experiences, including sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), encounters with strange beings, and other anomalous phenomena. The authors draw on a variety of sources, including historical texts, eyewitness accounts, and scientific data, to build a comprehensive picture of the phenomenon and its evolution over time.

One of the key themes of the book is the idea that the phenomenon of unexplained aerial objects has been a consistent and persistent part of human experience, and that it is not simply a modern phenomenon. The authors argue that many of the reports of strange objects and experiences throughout history are consistent with modern UFO sightings, and that this suggests that the phenomenon is not a recent development, but rather a long-standing and recurring part of human experience.

Another important theme of the book is the idea that the phenomenon of unexplained aerial objects is not easily explained by conventional scientific or technological explanations. The authors argue that while some UFO sightings can be explained by natural phenomena or misidentifications, there is a significant body of evidence that suggests the existence of something more mysterious and unexplained.

The authors also explore the social and cultural aspects of the phenomenon, and the way in which people have responded to sightings and reports of strange objects in the sky throughout history. They examine the ways in which people have attempted to explain the phenomenon, both scientifically and mythologically, and the way in which it has been incorporated into different cultural and religious beliefs and practices.

Overall, "Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times" provides a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of the phenomenon of unexplained aerial objects, and offers a unique and thought-provoking perspective on one of the most intriguing and mysterious aspects of human experience. Whether you are a student of history, a researcher in the field of UFO studies, or simply someone with a curiosity about the unexplained, this book is a valuable and informative resource.
