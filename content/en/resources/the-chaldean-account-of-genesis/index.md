### About George Smith

George Smith was a British Assyriologist from a working-class Victorian family, had limited educational opportunities. At fourteen, he apprenticed with Bradbury and Evans in London to learn banknote engraving, where he excelled. He was captivated by Assyrian culture and history from a young age, reading extensively on the subject in his spare time. His passion led him to spend lunch hours at the British Museum, studying cuneiform tablets discovered near Mosul, Iraq by Layard, Rawlinson, and Rassam during the 1840-1855 archaeological expeditions. In 1863, Smith married Mary Clifton, and they had six children. His natural talent for cuneiform was first noticed by Samuel Birch. Smith's most significant achievements include deciphering the Epic of Gilgamesh, particularly the flood narrative, significantly advancing the understanding of Assyrian and Babylonian cultures and histories. In March 1876, the British Museum trustees sent him to excavate more of the Library of Ashurbanipal. Tragically, Smith fell ill with dysentery in Ä°kizce, a village near Aleppo, and died there at the age of 36 on 19 August.
