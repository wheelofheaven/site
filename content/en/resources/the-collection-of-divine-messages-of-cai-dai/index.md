"The Collection of Divine Messages" (Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển), a key scripture of the Đạo Cao Đài religion, was compiled in 1926, encapsulating the divine teachings and revelations central to this Vietnamese religious movement. This collection is comprised of two volumes of messages, believed to be communicated by the Supreme Being and various Divine Spirits to the followers of Đạo Cao Đài.

The first volume contains several critical teachings. These include the Divine Teaching of the Jade Emperor, who introduces himself and announces the names of the twelve disciples, marking a significant moment in the development of the faith​. Another central teaching concerns Spiritism and Automatic Writing, where the medium's peri-spirit is guided to receive and transcribe divine messages, emphasizing the importance of purity of mind and body for successful spiritual communication​.

The teachings also emphasize unity, cooperation, and the glorification of the Way, advocating for collective effort in serving the Great Faith and the pursuit of Nirvana. It underlines the challenges of transforming the hearts of evil ones and the need for spiritual self-cultivation​​. Additionally, the volume contains a Divine Poem emphasizing the importance of teaching and nurturing the human spirit as part of societal development​.

Furthermore, the teachings elaborate on the veneration of Heaven and the Divine Eye, a central symbol in Đạo Cao Đài. This includes specific instructions on ceremonial practices, the significance of prostrations, and the symbolic representation of Yin and Yang in the Tao. It also discusses the unification of the physical matter, peri-spirit, and spirit, leading to saintly enlightenment​.

The Collection of Divine Messages, through its diverse and profound teachings, plays a pivotal role in the religious and spiritual life of the Đạo Cao Đài community, offering guidance on religious practices, moral conduct, and the path to spiritual enlightenment.

### Structure of the messages

The "Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển" is a central scripture in Đạo Cao Đài, a monotheistic religion founded in Vietnam. This collection is composed of two volumes:

- **Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển 1:** This volume contains 88 sections, not counting the part titled "Thi Văn Dạy Đạo" (Poetry Teaching the Way). It was compiled by high-ranking dignitaries Thượng Phẩm Cao Quỳnh Cư, Bảo Pháp Nguyễn Trung Hậu, and Đầu Sư Ngọc Lịch Nguyệt. This volume reflects the early teachings and directives given to the followers of Đạo Cao Đài, providing foundational guidance and spiritual insights​. The first volume was compiled in 1927.

- **Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển 2:** Published later in 1963, this second volume consists of 86 sections and, like the first volume, excludes "Thi Văn Dạy Đạo." The compilation of this volume was overseen by Hiến pháp Trương Hữu Ðức, following a directive from Thượng Sanh Cao Hoài Sang. This volume likely continued the themes of spiritual teachings and organizational guidance for the Đạo Cao Đài community​​. The second volume was compiled much later than volume 1, namely in 1963.

The structure of "Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển" reflects the multifaceted nature of Đạo Cao Đài, incorporating a wide range of spiritual messages and teachings. The content is believed to be communications from the Supreme Being and other spiritual entities, guiding adherents in their religious practice and spiritual development.

### Authorship

The "Thánh Ngôn Hiệp Tuyển" is known to contain messages believed to be communicated by the Supreme Being and various Divine Spirits. These messages were typically conveyed through mediums during séances, a common practice in Đạo Cao Đài for receiving spiritual guidance and revelations. The identities of these mediums, however, is not known without further research into the topic.

### About Caodaism

Đạo Cao Đài, also known as Caodaism, is a syncretic, monotheistic religion founded in Vietnam in the early 20th century. The faith, officially established in 1926, combines elements of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and Islam, along with traditional Vietnamese spiritual beliefs. The religion's full name, "Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ," translates to "The Great Faith for the Third Universal Redemption."

Central to Caodaism is the belief in a single Supreme Being, often visually represented by an all-seeing eye, symbolizing divine wisdom and omnipresence. The religion also venerates a pantheon of saints that include historical, religious, and mythical figures from various cultures, reflecting its inclusive and universalist philosophy.

Caodaism teaches the principle of spiritual evolution, where human souls progress through multiple incarnations towards perfection and eventual union with the Supreme Being. The faith places a strong emphasis on moral living, vegetarianism, meditation, and prayer as means to spiritual advancement.

The religion's organizational structure resembles that of a government, complete with legislative, executive, and judicial branches, symbolizing the faith's comprehensive approach to managing both spiritual and worldly matters. Caodaist temples, known for their colorful and eclectic architecture, often feature symbols and images that reflect the faith's diverse influences.

Caodaism's emergence was part of a broader spiritual renaissance in Vietnam during the early 20th century, a period marked by a re-examination of traditional beliefs and the exploration of new religious ideas. Today, Caodaism continues to be practiced primarily in Vietnam, with a significant number of followers worldwide, contributing to the global tapestry of religious thought and practice.
