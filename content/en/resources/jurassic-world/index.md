_Jurassic World_ is a 2015 American science fiction adventure film and the fourth installment in the _Jurassic Park_ franchise. Directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Trevorrow, Derek Connolly, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, the film is set 22 years after the events of the original _Jurassic Park_ and takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off Costa Rica's Pacific Coast.

In _Jurassic World,_ the island has been transformed into a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. The story follows the park's operations manager, Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, and a velociraptor trainer, Owen Grady, portrayed by Chris Pratt. The plot thickens when a genetically engineered dinosaur, the Indominus rex, breaks loose and causes chaos across the park. The film explores themes of corporate greed, ethical responsibility in genetic engineering, and humanity's relationship with nature.

_Jurassic World_ was a major box office success, grossing over $1.6 billion worldwide, and received generally positive reviews for its visuals, action sequences, and Pratt's performance. It revived the franchise after a 14-year hiatus and was followed by sequels _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ in 2018 and _Jurassic World: Dominion_ in 2022, continuing the story of human encounters with genetically resurrected dinosaurs in a rapidly changing world.

### Common themes

At the core of both narratives is the theme of genetic engineering and its potential for catastrophic outcomes. _Jurassic World_ vividly portrays the dangers of human hubris in scientific pursuits, particularly in the creation of the genetically modified Indominus rex, which ultimately wreaks havoc. This mirrors the Wheel of Heaven’s emphasis on the repercussions of humans playing God through genetic manipulation, echoing the cautionary tale of unchecked scientific progress.

Another significant thematic strand is the creation and manipulation of new life forms. The Wheel of Heaven website delves into the concept of visionary scientists pushing the boundaries of genetics to create new species, a scenario that unfolds tragically in "Jurassic World." The film's narrative illustrates the unpredictable and often perilous consequences of such endeavors, resonating with the website's skepticism towards the unchecked creation of life.

Additionally, the intersection of genetic engineering with other advanced technologies, such as space exploration, forms a compelling thematic link. _Jurassic World_ subtly hints at this through the dialogue about the profitability of space programs, suggesting a future where various fields of advanced technology evolve in tandem. This notion aligns with the Wheel of Heaven's broader perspective on the parallel development of genetic engineering and space travel, underscoring the multifaceted nature of scientific advancement.

### Thematic scenes from the movie

The following excerpts from _Jurassic World,_ are noteworthy, illustrating the film's depiction of advanced genetic engineering and its concurrent development with space exploration, reflecting key themes in contemporary scientific endeavors.

#### "She was DESIGNED."

In this pivotal scene from _Jurassic World,_ the dialogue between Claire, Osterly, Drucker, and Dr. Henry Wu encapsulates several central themes that resonate deeply with the Wheel of Heaven's exploration of science, ethics, and the allure of discovery.

Claire's introduction of the Indominus Rex as the park's first genetically modified hybrid underscores the audacity of human ingenuity in bending natural laws to meet commercial desires. This moment reflects the website's focus on the ethical implications of genetic engineering, where the pursuit of thrills and commercial success overshadows the profound responsibility that comes with creating life.

Drucker's reaction, mingled with skepticism and curiosity, mirrors our collective bewilderment at the possibilities and dangers of genetic manipulation. His struggle to articulate the process of creating such a creature highlights the often incomprehensible complexity behind such scientific feats, a theme prevalent in the Wheel of Heaven's narrative.

Dr. Wu's assertion that the Indominus Rex was "designed" rather than bred is particularly telling. It suggests a shift from traditional notions of natural evolution to a new era where life is engineered to specification. This aligns with the website's thematic exploration of the power and perils of playing God, emphasizing the profound implications of such scientific advancements.

### "...Like the Space program"

In this succinct yet impactful scene from _Jurassic World,_ Claire's comparison of the park's need for constant innovation to the space program encapsulates a significant theme that aligns closely with the Wheel of Heaven's exploration: the simultaneous advancement of life creation technologies and space exploration.

> The construction crews are on break as Claire and Owen get out of the car. Owen stares up at the towering walls, looking unconvinced and more than a little uneasy.
>
> CLAIRE
> We've been pre-booking tickets for months. The park needs a new attraction every few years in order to reinvigorate the public's interest. Kinda like the space program.
>
> She walks over to the flight up steps leading up to the observation tower. Owen follows. 
>

Claire's reference to pre-booking and the public's craving for new attractions draws a parallel between the creation of genetically engineered dinosaurs and the grandeur of space travel. This dialogue succinctly reflects the Wheel of Heaven's focus on a unique period in human history where the ability to design and resurrect life converges with the meaningful exploration of space. This convergence symbolizes a pivotal moment in human capability, marked by extraordinary technological feats in both biological and astronomical fields.

The scene, in its brevity, highlights the critical intersection of these two realms of human achievement, underscoring the profound implications of this dual advancement for our understanding of life, space, and our place in the universe.
