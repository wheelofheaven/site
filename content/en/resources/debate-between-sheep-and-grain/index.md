The "Debate between sheep and grain" or "Myth of cattle and grain" is a significant Sumerian creation myth from the mid to late 3rd millennium BC. This myth is one of several "debate" topics known from Sumerian literature, characterized as disputations. Such debates were philosophical in nature and often addressed humanity's place in the world, reflecting a sophisticated level of abstract thought in ancient Mesopotamian societies.

In this particular myth, the god An creates the cattle-goddess Lahar and the grain goddess Ashnan to provide food and clothing for the Anunnaki, the deities who, according to Sumerian belief, created mankind. Lahar and Ashnan are brought to life in a "duku" or pure place. The Anunnaki furnish Lahar with a sheepfold complete with plants and herbs, symbolizing the advent of animal husbandry. For Ashnan, they provide a house, a plough, and a yoke, representing the introduction of agriculture.

The narrative then unfolds with a quarrel between the two goddesses over the value and importance of their respective contributions to human civilization. This quarrel is eventually resolved by the intervention of the gods Enki and Enlil, who declare Ashnan the victor. The resolution of the debate signifies the primacy of agriculture over animal husbandry in Sumerian society, a reflection of the civilization's heavy reliance on grain crops for sustenance.

The "Debate between sheep and grain" is an integral part of Sumerian literature, offering insight into the culture's views on the natural world and the origins of essential aspects of human civilization, such as farming and livestock rearing. By personifying these crucial elements as deities, the Sumerians imbued their understanding of agriculture and animal husbandry with a sacred quality, reflecting their deep connection to the land and its bounty​.
