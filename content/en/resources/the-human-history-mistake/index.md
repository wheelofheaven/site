Zillmer argues that numerous Stone Age artifacts, including the skulls of Neanderthals and individuals from the Paleolithic era, are much younger than traditionally believed.

"The Human History Mistake: The Neanderthals and other Inventions of the Evolution and Earth Sciences" is a work by German author Hans-Joachim Zillmer that challenges conventional views on human evolution and the age of archaeological findings. Zillmer argues that numerous Stone Age artifacts, including the skulls of Neanderthals and individuals from the Paleolithic era, are much younger than traditionally believed. He contends that these should be dated as young as a few thousand or even hundreds of years, rather than the accepted timeline of 27,000 years or more.

Zillmer's work is a critique of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. He suggests that the evidence he has compiled, which includes factual material and empirical facts from around the world, disproves the widely accepted theory of human evolution. His stance is that our ancestors did not evolve from apes nor live in trees, challenging fundamental aspects of Darwinian evolution.

Throughout his career, spanning more than three decades, Zillmer has focused on investigating contentious findings and highlighting inconsistencies in the scientific understanding of human history and evolution. His work represents a controversial viewpoint within the scientific community, positioning itself against the mainstream consensus on human evolutionary history​​​​​​​.

### About Hans-Joachim Zillmer

Hans-Joachim Zillmer is a German author known for his controversial views on conventional scientific theories, particularly in the fields of archaeology, geology, and evolutionary biology. He has built a reputation for challenging established scientific beliefs, often proposing alternative theories that diverge significantly from mainstream scientific consensus.

Zillmer's work typically focuses on scrutinizing and questioning the evidence supporting widely accepted scientific theories. He is especially critical of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, as seen in his book "The Human History Mistake: The Neanderthals and other Inventions of the Evolution and Earth Sciences," where he argues against the evolutionary lineage of humans from apes and questions the dating of archaeological artifacts.

Zillmer's approach often involves compiling empirical data and factual material from various sources worldwide to support his theories. He has dedicated a significant part of his career to investigating contentious findings and highlighting what he perceives as inconsistencies in the scientific community's understanding of human history, geology, and evolution.

While Zillmer has gained a following and is recognized as a bestselling author in Germany, his work is generally viewed with skepticism by the mainstream scientific community. His theories and conclusions are often considered fringe or pseudo-scientific by many experts in the relevant fields. Despite this, Zillmer continues to contribute to the discourse surrounding these subjects, representing a voice outside of traditional scientific paradigms.
