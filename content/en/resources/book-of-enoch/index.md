The Avesta is the holy scripture of Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. Composed over several centuries, its authorship is traditionally attributed to the prophet Zoroaster (from the Greek transcription Ζωροάστρης, Zōroastrēs), also known as Zarathustra (from the Avestan 𐬰𐬀𐬭𐬀𐬚𐬎𐬱𐬙𐬭𐬀, transliterated Zaraθuštra) but it likely includes contributions from many authors. The Avesta consists of various parts, including hymns, liturgical texts, mythological lore, moral guidance, and prayers. These texts are central to Zoroastrian religious practice and philosophy, emphasizing the cosmic struggle between good and evil. Much of the original Avesta has been lost over time, with surviving manuscripts dating back to the 13th century CE, primarily in Middle Persian language.

### Manuscripts and history

The history of the Avesta's manuscripts is complex, marked by periods of turmoil and loss. The original Avestan language script was lost over time, and the surviving manuscripts are primarily in Pahlavi, the Middle Persian language. The oldest surviving copies of these texts date back to the 13th century CE, but their content is undoubtedly much older.

Throughout history, the Avesta underwent various redactions and revisions, especially during the Sassanian Empire (224–651 CE). The Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE led to a significant decline in Zoroastrianism and the dispersal of its scriptures. Much of the Avesta was destroyed or lost, and only a fraction of the original texts survives to this day.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Western scholars began to study the Avesta more rigorously, comparing different manuscripts and translations. This period marked a revival of interest in Zoroastrian texts and helped preserve what remained of the ancient scripture.

### Contents and structure

The Avesta is divided into several major parts, each serving a unique function within the Zoroastrian religious framework:

- **Yasna:** It contains the Gathas and other liturgical texts. The Yasna's primary purpose is for use in Zoroastrian ritual and worship.

- **Visperad:** This part includes supplements to the Yasna and is used during specific Zoroastrian festivals.

- **Vendidad:** This section contains a mix of mythological lore, moral guidance, and ritual purity laws.

- **Yashts:** These are hymns dedicated to various Zoroastrian deities and spiritual figures.

- **Khordeh Avesta:** This is a smaller, more concise collection of prayers used by lay followers in daily practice.

The structure of the Avesta reflects a combination of spiritual guidance, liturgical material, and moral law, all essential to the practice of Zoroastrianism.


### Authorship

The Avesta's authorship is traditionally attributed to Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), an ancient Iranian prophet whose date of existence is debated but often placed around 1000 BCE. However, the texts themselves are likely the work of many authors over several centuries. The oldest part, the Gathas, is a series of hymns believed to be composed by Zoroaster. These hymns reflect his religious and ethical teachings, forming the core philosophy of Zoroastrianism. Later sections of the Avesta were written by different generations of priests, accumulating over time to form the entire scripture.
