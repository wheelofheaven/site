description: "Joseph A. Seiss — The Gospel in the Stars (1884)"
lead: "Do the heavens that reveal God's glory also reveal His plan of salvation? Yes, says Joseph A. Seiss, who contemplated the strange figures of the Zodiac and studied the writings of astronomers through the ages. Drawing upon scientific, historical and biblical sources, Seiss assembles persuasive arguments supporting his thesis that the Gospel of Jesus Christ can be seen in the stars."
