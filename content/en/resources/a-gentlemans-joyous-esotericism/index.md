> The article reconstructs the narratives advanced by the author Jean Sendy (1910-1978). His life is reconstructed as well. It is argued that Sendy was a cultivated, sophisticated and ironic author, deeply different, by virtue of his books’ quality, from other proponents of the “ancient aliens” narratives with whom he is often paired.
