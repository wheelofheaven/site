As science and technology advance, our ability to explore the cosmos and search for extraterrestrial life could potentially lead to discoveries that support the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth. In this context, people might be more open to considering the claims explored in here at _Wheel of Heaven_, which could result in an increased interest in its teachings and the possibility of a common extraterrestrial origin for humanity.

The progress of technology could also facilitate the dissemination of these considerations on a global scale, making it easier for people around the world to access and engage with its ideas. This widespread exposure might contribute to a greater acceptance of alternative explanations for the origins of life and the nature of religious beliefs.

Furthermore, the contemporary geopolitical landscape has seen increased interest in the subject of disclosure, with government agencies and individuals releasing previously classified information about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and other unexplained events. This growing openness could contribute to a shift in public opinion and a greater willingness to consider the possibility of extraterrestrial life and its potential involvement in human history.

In such a scenario, the convergence of these factors could lead to a "Great Awakening" where people become more receptive to such ideas and other alternative explanations for the origins of life and the development of religious beliefs. This could potentially result in a reevaluation of the nature of human existence and our place in the universe.
