Paul Anthony Wallis is an author, researcher, and speaker, who has written several books on the topics of early Christianity, Gnosticism, and the origins of humanity.

He has also studied Gnosticism, a set of religious and philosophical beliefs that emerged in the early Christian era and were considered heretical by the Church.
