"Creators: The Past" is an Italian science fiction fantasy film directed by Piergiuseppe Zaia, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Eleonora Fani and composed the soundtrack. The film features a notable cast, including Eleonora Fani, Jennifer Mischiati, Bruce Payne, and guest appearances by Gérard Depardieu and William Shatner. The plot revolves around the manipulation of mankind's destiny by a race of powerful extraterrestrials known as the Creators. It was announced as the first part of a planned trilogy, with the next two installments being "Creators: The Present" and "Creators: The Future."

The story offers a fictional explanation for why the Mayan prophecy of 2012 did not come to pass. It depicts a universe on the brink of an extraordinary planetary alignment, causing a total eclipse visible from Earth. This alignment prompts a meeting of the eight godlike members of the Galactic Council, each governing their own planet. The film delves into themes of extraterrestrial intervention in human affairs, including the revelation that mankind was created by aliens and that all religions are fabrications to control humanity.

The reception of "Creators: The Past" has been mixed. While some viewers appreciate the film's attempt at exploring complex themes and its contributions to the fantasy and sci-fi genres, particularly in the Italian film industry, others criticize it for a confusing and overloaded screenplay, underdeveloped characters, and subpar special effects. The film has been described as both a visually striking work with an interesting premise and as a disjointed narrative that struggles to coherently present its ambitious ideas. Some reviews praise the film's notable cast and the beauty of its soundtrack, while others express disappointment in its execution, suggesting that the film could not fully realize its potential due to these narrative and technical shortcomings.
