The website Temporary Temples is dedicated to exploring and documenting crop circles, particularly in the UK. It provides information about the latest crop circle formations, including their locations, images, and descriptions. Additionally, the site features galleries showcasing various crop circle designs throughout the years. It offers insights into their patterns, sizes, and intricacies. The website also provides information about events, tours, and workshops related to crop circles for those interested in engaging more deeply with the phenomenon.

Steve Alexander has been photographing the crop circles for more than 30 years. His wife, Karen Alexander helped him by providing and researching commentary on these crop circles. Together, they launched Temporary Temples to document and archive all reported crop circles from all around the world.

On their "About us" page, the following is stated about their aims and goals:

> The Temporary Temples website was built to fulfil several key aims. The first being an online archive (freely open to the public) to view pictures of the crop circle phenomenon as we have recorded it since 1994. Secondly, to provide a journalistic service reporting new circles whenever and wherever they appear. We also strive to provide educational and contextual materials about the locations, geometry and symbolism of each circle – giving map links, approximate measurements and some drawings which look at the number, math and geometry of the circles. Our website is free to view and therefore the images and information are an open resource to whomever needs them. We will aslo endeavour to keep this website free from  general advertising.

As such, Temporary Temples serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone intrigued by the mystery and beauty of crop circles, offering a blend of documentation, analysis, and community engagement.
