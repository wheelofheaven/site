Raëlism is a religious and philosophical movement that originated in France in the 1970s. It is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim created life on Earth and continue to interact with humanity. The founder of Raëlism, Claude Vorilhon, also known as Raël, claims that he had a series of encounters with a being from another planet who gave him messages to share with the world.

According to Raëlian beliefs, the Elohim are highly advanced beings who used their genetic engineering skills to create humans and other species. Raelians believe that all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, have their origins in ancient extraterrestrial visitations, and that the Elohim are the gods described in various mythologies.

The Raëlian movement emphasizes individual freedom and tolerance, and seeks to promote peace and understanding among people of all cultures and religions. They also advocate for scientific and technological advancements, such as cloning, as a means of improving human life and creating a better future for all.
