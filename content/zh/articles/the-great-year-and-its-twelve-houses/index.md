## 大年

每当我们想要理解我们在宇宙中的位置时，我们凝视深邃的夜空，在我们的视野中迷失在无数的星星中。似乎在我们上方展开的宇宙活动构成了一幅宏伟的叙事，我们地球居民仅是其中的一个场景。

因此，对于任何地球居民来说，开始对他们在广袤的时空中的位置和意义进行探索是自然而然的。

我们对天体的理解始于承认地球的**三个重要运动**：

1. 围绕自身轴的旋转
2. 围绕太阳的公转
3. 轴心的岁差

前两个运动在我们的日常生活中是固有的，我们通过切身体验它们的影响。然而，尽管其重要性，第三个运动却很容易被遗忘。这三个运动都表现出周期性的模式，随着时间的推移重复，形成具有特定持续时间或**周期**的循环。

| 地球运动 | 周期（约）   | 常用名称   |
| -        | -           | -         |
| (1) 旋转 | 24小时     | 白天/黑夜 |
| (2) 公转 | 365天      | 年         |
| (3) 岁差 | 26,000年    | 大年       |

日夜循环（1）是地球自转的结果，对生命有着重大影响。为了实际目的，我们将一天分为两个相等的`12小时`段，与调节包括人类在内的许多哺乳动物的觉醒和睡眠的[昼夜节律](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm)相一致。

第二个周期，一年（2），可以通过春夏秋冬的季节变化来观察，尤其是在高纬度和低纬度地区。我们通常将阳历年份分为十二个部分，或**月份**，每个月份约为`30.5天`。

虽然此处没有详细讨论月亮的循环，但需要注意的是，月亮几乎每年出现13次，每个**月相周期**略长于`28天`。这种农历年和阳历年之间的差异引发了关于我们的日历系统的有趣问题。

第三个循环，虽然不太为人所知，但同样重要，那就是地球的**岁差**或**黄道岁差**。它也被称为**大年**（3），一个完整的周期需要花费`25,772`到`25,920年`的时间。

[岁差]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/precession.md" >}})是一个复杂的运动，难以在没有视觉辅助的情况下描述。为了提供背景，让我们来看看[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precession)对岁差的定义：

> 某一旋转体的旋转轴相对于相交的另一条线进行相对较慢的回转，以描述一个圆锥[^merriam]

对于像地球这样的行星，需要指明指的是所谓的黄道岁差。《大英百科全书》对黄道岁差的定义如下：

> ... 平动是指地球的岁差沿着黄道（地球轨道的平面）的运动所引起的赤道点的运动。[^britannica]

下图阐明了岁差，描绘了地球的旋转轴以循环方式**回转**的情况：

{{< figure src="images/precession_schema.jpg" caption="图1 - 岁差" >}}

岁差的方向（顶部的圆形箭头）与地球的自转（环绕地球的圆形箭头）相抵消。这些相互冲突的旋转在我们的天空中产生了独特的舞蹈。对于地球上的观察者来说，这意味着天空对星座的日常舞蹈与岁差引起的缓慢华尔兹相互交织，而岁差的周期为`25,920年`。

岁差的影响是巨大的，并且它构成了我们对时间和占星时代的理解的基础。在我们度过大年的旅程中，星星的背景逐渐变化。这种宇宙的转变虽然在人类寿命内难以察觉，但在数千年的时间尺度上具有深远的影响。

在下一节中，我们将深入探讨这些影响，揭示穿插在我们通过大年的天体旅程中的占星时代及其对我们社会文化演变的影响。

[^merriam]: Merriam-Webster是一家知名的美国出版商，以出版词典和参考书籍而闻名。根据他们的定义，岁差指的是旋转体的旋转轴相对于相交的另一条线进行相对较慢的回转，创造出一个类似圆锥的运动。详情请参阅：[precession (noun) | Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precession)

[^britannica]: 黄道岁差是指地球绕自身轴的渐进的旋转中，赤道点沿地球轨道平面的周期性移动。根据权威的百科全书《大英百科全书》的解释，岁差是由于地球自转轴逐渐移动而导致赤道点的周期性移动。详情请参阅：[precession of the equinoxes | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes)

## 十二宫

通过理解[地球的三个重要运动](#大年)，我们认识到这些天体律动提供了一个复杂的参照框架，使我们能够概念化和测量时间。这些周期性的运动具有几个引人入胜的特点：

+ **明确的周期性**：这些运动未受人为干预，呈现出重复的宇宙编舞，以韵律循环的方式重复相同的模式，一旦完成就必然重新开始。
+ **时间流逝的一致性**：由于这种固有的周期性，我们可以期望在给定的周期中时间的流逝是完全相同的。这提供了一种预测性和可靠性，是人造系统所无法比拟的。
+ **时间的细粒度**：完整周期的自然分段提供了更小的离散时间单位，使我们能够以可消化的片段感知时间，而不是压倒性和连续的时间跨度。

这些和谐的宇宙律动蕴含着一种深刻的神秘感和宏伟感，超出了我们通常人类感知的尺度。因此，将这些天体运动作为一个时间测量框架具有直观吸引力，特别是因为这三个运动都具有相互补充的间隔。

由地球的自转产生的一天成为一个可计数的单位，而由地球的公转产生的一年，则提供了一种切实可行的度量方法，用于衡量大年的巨大性。

这种时间尺度的互锁引发了一个有趣的模式：将自转和公转周期分成**12个单位**。这种分割，虽然看似任意，但在应用于岁差周期或**大年**时具有深远的影响。

将**大年**分为十二等分，诞生了一个新的时间单位：大月，每个大月跨越惊人的`2,160年`。这个单位体现了一个巨大的时间跨度，使我们传统的年份相形见绌，并为跨越千年门槛的时间范围提供了一个度量。

[大月](#wiki/encyclopedia/great-month)的概念提供了一个更大的时间框架，涵盖了文明的兴衰、文化和思想的演进以及科学理解的进步。它让我们拥有了一个超越个人甚至历史经验的时间视角，进入到通常我们只用于地质或天文事件的尺度中。

就像日常和年度周期对我们理解时间的重要性一样，大月可能成为理解长期趋势和周期的重要工具。随着我们对我们自己（古代的）历史、地球的构成和天文模式的认识不断增长，我们可能会发现大月的概念有助于我们理解跨越数千年的模式和事件，为我们在宇宙中的位置提供更广泛的背景。

由大年的十二个宫所提供的这种更广泛的时间框架，每个宫是一个大月，使我们能够理解那些本来似乎难以理解的广阔时间跨度。这是一个宇宙日历，将我们短暂的存在置于宇宙的宏伟编年史之中。

## 标记时间：一年中的基准日的重要性

在我们继续宇宙之旅之前，重点关注地球绕太阳的年度旅程中的另一个独特方面是受到行星[倾斜角度](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt)对其轨道平面的影响，倾斜角度为`23.44°`。这个倾斜不仅赋予我们的行星其特有的季节节奏，而且影响我们在一年中如何感知太阳的光线。

让我们深入探讨这些天文概念。**天球赤道**是地球赤道在天空中的投影，而**黄道**则是太阳在这个天球中由于地球公转而描绘的视觉路径。天球赤道和黄道每年在两个特定点交叉，标记着**春分和秋分**。这些春分和秋分表示全球白昼和黑夜的时长相等的时刻。**春分**（也被称为**春分点**）通常在3月20日左右，而**秋分**大约在9月22日左右。

相反，**夏至和冬至**则表示地球的一个半球经历一年中最长的白昼或黑夜的时刻。**夏至**通常在6月21日左右，而**冬至**发生在12月21日左右。

这些春分、夏至、秋分和冬至 - 也就是**基准日** - 被视为我们日历中重要的天文里程碑，标志着每个季节的开始。

| 基准点             | 一年中的日期                    | 感知特征                            |
| -                  | -                              | -                                   |
| **春分**          | ~ 3月20日左右                  | 白昼和黑夜长度相等                 |
| **夏至**          | ~ 6月21日左右                  | 北半球最长的白昼                    |
| **秋分**          | ~ 9月22日左右                  | 白昼和黑夜长度相等                 |
| **冬至**          | ~ 12月21日左右                 | 北半球最长的黑夜                    |

请记住，春分、秋分或冬至代表的是一个特定的时刻，此时**天球赤道**与**黄道**重合，而不是整个一天。另一种定义春分或秋分的方法是可见太阳中心直接位于地球赤道上的时刻。

将地球视为一个宏伟的天体钟表，基准日可以被看作钟面上的**四个象限**的标记。实际上，如果我们要选择一个时刻来进行天体测量的比较，基准日，特别是**春分**，由于其全球可观测的特点，将是最理想的选择。

## Marking Time: The Importance of Cardinal Days in a Year

Before we continue our cosmic journey, it's crucial to focus on another distinctive aspect of Earth's annual journey around the Sun, influenced by the planet's [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt) of `23.44°` in relation to its orbital plane. This tilt not only gives our planet its characteristic seasonal rhythm but also impacts how we perceive the Sun's light throughout the year.

Let's delve a bit deeper into these astronomical concepts. The **celestial equator** is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the sky, while the **ecliptic** is the apparent path the Sun traces in this celestial sphere due to Earth's revolution. The celestial equator and ecliptic intersect twice a year at two specific points, marking the **spring and autumnal equinoxes**. These equinoxes signify the moment when the duration of day and night is equal across the globe. The **spring equinox** (also known as the **vernal equinox**) typically occurs on the 20<sup>th</sup> of March, and the **autumnal equinox** around the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September.

Conversely, the **summer and winter solstices** denote the moments when one hemisphere of the Earth experiences the longest day or longest night of the year, respectively. The **summer solstice** generally falls on the 21<sup>st</sup> of June, while the **winter solstice** occurs around the 21<sup>st</sup> of December.

These equinoxes and solstices - the **cardinal days** - are considered pivotal astronomical milestones in our calendar, marking the start of each season.

| Cardinality         | Day in a year                  | Perceptibility                           |
| -                   | -                              | -                                        |
| **Vernal equinox**  | ~ 20<sup>th</sup> of March     | Day and night of equal length            |
| **Summer solstice** | ~ 21<sup>st</sup> of June      | Longest day in the Northern Hemisphere    |
| **Autumn equinox**  | ~ 22<sup>nd</sup> of September | Day and night of equal length            |
| **Winter solstice** | ~ 21<sup>st</sup> of December  | Longest night in the Northern Hemisphere  |

Bear in mind that an equinox or solstice represents a specific moment in time when the **celestial equator** aligns with the **ecliptic**, not an entire day. Another way to define an equinox is the moment when the visible Sun's center is directly over the Earth's equator.

Viewing Earth as a grand celestial clockwork, the cardinal days can be seen as markers for the **four quadrants** on a clock face. In essence, if we were to pick a moment to compare celestial measurements, the cardinal days, particularly the **equinoxes**, would be the most desirable due to their globally observable characteristics.

## Astronomical watchmaking

Navigating the intricate choreography of Earth's three key motions - two of which present a rapid periodicity - is a demanding task, particularly when trying to discern the glacial pace of the third motion, the **precession**. Its slow, stately progression requires the observer to select a specific moment each year for stellar observation, akin to the interplay of distinct mechanisms within a mechanical wristwatch that work in harmony to accurately portray time. Just as a wristwatch employs a time reference, typically `0` or `12 o'clock`, the Great Year also calls for a defining point of reference.

To construct our model of an astronomical timepiece, we need to consider specific reference points, namely:

+ **First motion [rotation]**: Sunrise, which heralds the start of a new day
+ **Second motion [revolution]**: Spring Equinox, marking the arrival of a new cycle of seasons
+ **Geographical point of reference**: Due East, the direction from which the Sun makes its daily ascent

By leveraging these sensible parameters to establish our 'zero' point, we can now observe the celestial tapestry – the stars or constellations – unfolding against the backdrop of the **Great Year**.

One might then wonder, what constellation graces the pre-dawn sky on the spring equinox, rising in unison with the Sun due east, **in our current era**?

{{< figure src="images/20202003_vernal_equinox_stellarium.jpg" caption="Fig. 2 - Vernal equinox on the 20<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 due east, taken with Stellarium" >}}

As we look to the heavens, we find ourselves at the threshold of a cosmic shift, where the constellation of Pisces is giving way to the upcoming constellation of Aquarius. This celestial transition silently marks the passage of millennia, a grand celestial clock advancing into a new age. This is the precise moment where the ancient and the current converge, providing us with an invaluable glimpse into the cosmic shift into a new age. A new age that could have been easily predicted for millenia if the awareness and knowledge about axial precession were given.

## The Cycle of Zodiacal Ages

Our prior assumptions about celestial observations and their correlation with the slow progression of the precession of the equinoxes were not arbitrary. This understanding is deeply rooted in antiquity. This exploration propounds that the _Zodiac's genesis is intrinsically linked to precession_. The term [Zodiac]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/zodiac.md" >}}) refers to a group of 12 constellations, whose mention transcends written history and cultural boundaries. Undeniably, the Zodiac and its derivative study, now known as astrology, have been of significance for thousands of years.

The oldest known civilization, the Sumerians, had profound respect and knowledge of the Zodiac. Linking the precession to the Zodiac is controversial, as it implies comprehensive understanding of the former, requiring considerable scientific knowledge including the concept of Earth as a globe. To attribute such cosmological insights to the earliest known civilization would challenge the contemporary consensus on known history, casting doubt on the linear and gradual narrative of human progress. Such a perspective could provide a basis for alternative narratives.

Returning to the Zodiac, the term originates from Ancient Greek zōidiakòs kýklos (ζῳδιακός κύκλος) meaning _'cycle or circle of carved animals'[^zodiac]. However, in non-Indo-European languages, the Zodiac has different names. In Biblical Hebrew, the Zodiac is called **Mazzaroth** (מַזָּרוֹת), translating to *'garland of crowns'*[↩︎](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4626-constellations). The phrase *'mazel tov'* (מזל טוב‎), wishing *good luck* or more accurately *good fortune*, derives from *mazzaroth*. In Chinese logograms, the Zodiac is referred to as 獣帯, meaning *'animal belt'*.

The Zodiac comprises `12 constellations`, twelve signs. These twelve constellations are part of the ecliptic. This is no mere coincidence, as it is precisely the ecliptic which aligns with the celestial equator on the equinoxes (refer [Cardinal days in a year and their importance](#cardinal-days-in-a-year-and-their-importance)).

If following the ecliptic on the equinoxes is indeed the correct method to track the precession's progression, the Great Year, then the twelve constellations positioned along the ecliptic indeed represent the twelve houses or the twelve **Great Months** for a given **Great Year**. As we've established [earlier](#the-twelve-houses), dividing the Great Year into twelve houses makes each house last `2'160 years`.

One might wonder whether we have already transitioned into the [Age of Aquarius]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-aquarius.md" >}}) or are still in the [Age of Pisces]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-aquarius.md" >}}). To answer this, one must first understand when the precessional cycle initially began, or more specifically, when a given house precisely begins or ends. Unfortunately, this isn't easy to determine without significant assumptions. However, it is clear that as we progress through the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, the possibility of being in the new **Age of Aquarius** increases.

>  Aquarius is both a constellation and the twelfth of a circle known as a sign. Entering Aquarius means entering the period during which astronomers will see the sun rise in Aquarius on the day of the vernal equinox. The phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes is involved in this fact. The equinoctial sun has been rising in the sign of Aquarius since 1950. In this interpretation, we are in the 'Golden Age' of prophecies. The equinoctial sun will not begin rising in the constellation of Aquarius until about the year 2700. In this interpretation, neither you nor I will see the prophesied 'Golden Age'.
>
> -- Jean Sendy: Coming Of The Gods (1970), p. 69

The duration of a house could also be determined by the size of a given constellation in the sky. However, this would be a poorly defined assumption as the shapes of Zodiacal constellations vary greatly. Pisces, for instance, has a considerably large constellation, particularly in ecliptic length, whereas Aquarius is comparably short. There is a significant gap between these two constellations. It's important to note that the duration of a Great Month is 2'160 years, mimicking the twelfth section of its parent year cycle. For reasons that may be highlighted in future discussions, the year `1'950 AD` as the beginning of the Age of Aquarius appears to be our best assumption for now.

Based on these assumptions, calculating the **Zodiacal Ages** backward by decrements of `2'160 years`, we arrive at the following table:

| Zodiacal age              | Time span```
| -                         | -                    | -                           |
| :capricorn: Capricorn     | 21'810 -- 19'650 BC  | Sea goat, Mountain Goat     |
| :sagittarius: Sagittarius | 19'650 -- 17'490 BC  | Archer, Centaur             |
| :scorpius: Scorpio        | 17'490 -- 15'330 BC  | Eagle, Phoenix              |
| :libra: Libra             | 15'330 -- 13'170 BC  | Scales, Balance             |
| :virgo: Virgo             | 13'170 -- 11'010 BC  | Virgin, Grain Goddess       |
| :leo: Leo                 | 11'010 -- 8'850 BC   | Lion, Nemean Lion           |
| :cancer: Cancer           | 8'850 -- 6'690 BC    | Crab, Scarab, Turtle        |
| :gemini: Gemini           | 6'690 -- 4'530 BC    | Twins, Dioscuri             |
| :taurus: Taurus           | 4'530 -- 2'370 BC    | Bull, Calf, Bison           |
| :aries: Aries             | 2'370 -- 210 BC      | Ram, Golden Fleece          |
| :pisces: Pisces           | 210 BC -- 1'950 AD   | Fishes, Twin Fish           |
| :aquarius: Aquarius       | 1'950 AD -- 4'110 AD | Water Bearer, Fountain      |

These denote the [World Ages]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/world-age.md" >}}) of the past. Looking into the future, after Aquarius comes Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, and so on. The relevance of these ages extends beyond simply knowing the hour of a day, the day of a year, or the age of ages. Understanding precession and tracking it through ecliptic constellations allows us to position ourselves within larger timescales. It is a conventional way of referring to vast time spans surpassing mere years. If there's anything worthy of measuring **World Ages**, employing the Earth's third key motion, enabling millennia-long time references, is surely the most intelligent approach.

If our Earth's inhabitants employed this understanding in the past, could we now comprehend what they might have meant when referring to *world ages* or *aeons* of time?

[^zodiac]: According to Merriam-Webster, the term zodiac has the following definitions: a) Zodiac refers to an imaginary band in the celestial sphere that is centered on the ecliptic, encompassing the apparent paths of all the planets. It is divided into 12 constellations or signs, with each sign considered to extend 30 degrees of longitude, and is commonly used in astrology. b) Zodiac can also refer to a figure that represents the signs of the zodiac and their corresponding symbols, often used in astrological charts or illustrations. See here for more: [zodiac | Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zodiac)

## Encoding

Past civilizations have not only known about the **precession of the equinox**, but they have also endeavored to preserve this sacred knowledge. This preservation occurred in two notable forms: **language** and **constructions**. Both these forms served as mechanisms of encoding that have carried this ancient wisdom through ages, allowing it to transcend the ravages of time and cultural shifts.

### Hamlet's Mill

In 1969, a groundbreaking work was published that would provide an intricate insight into the encoded understanding of the precession of the equinoxes. This knowledge, the authors proposed, had its roots in an ancestral civilization characterized by a highly sophisticated understanding of the cosmos. This civilization, they claimed, had transmitted this knowledge through subsequent world civilizations, encoded within the rich tapestry of mythical images and narratives.

This remarkable study was conducted by Giorgio de Santillana (1902–1974), a professor of history of science at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hertha von Dechend (1915–2001), a professor of history of science, philosophy, and ethnology at the University of Frankfurt. Together they co-authored *Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth*.

Their book offers a revolutionary perspective, emphasizing the holistic and interconnected nature of archaic thought, and the profound role the celestial dynamics played in shaping their worldview. Let's allow their words to elucidate:

> "To begin with, there is no system that can be presented in modern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are no principles from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes from a time when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, and it would be unfair to search for one. There could hardly have been one among people who committed all their ideas to memory. It can be considered a pure structure of numbers. From the beginning, we considered calling this essay 'Art of the Fugue.' And that excludes any 'world-picture,' a point that cannot be stressed strongly enough. Any effort to use a diagram is bound to lead into contradiction. It is a matter of times and rhythm."
>
> "The subject has the nature of a hologram, something that has to be present as a whole to the mind. Archaic thought is cosmological first and last; it faces the gravest implications of a cosmos in ways which reverberate in later classic philosophy. The chief implication is a profound awareness that the fabric of the cosmos is not only determined, but overdetermined and in a way that does not permit the simple location of any of its agents, whether simple magic or astrology, forces, gods, numbers, planetary powers, Platonic Forms, Aristotelian Essences or Stoic Substances. Physical reality here cannot be analytical in the Cartesian sense; it cannot be reduced to concreteness even if misplaced. Being is change, motion, and rhythm, the irresistible circle of time, the incidence of the 'right moment', as determined by the skies."
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.56

Santillana and von Dechend challenge the modern perception of precession as a trivial celestial motion and invoke the grand vision our ancestors had towards this cycle. They argue that the precession, for our forebears, represented a majestic secular motion — a peg on which they hung their profound thoughts about cosmic time:

> "We today are aware of the Precession as the gentle tilting of our globe, an irrelevant one at that. As the GI said, lost in the depth of jungle misery, when his friends took refuge in their daydreams: 'When I close my eyes, I see only a mule's behind. Also when I don't.' This is, as it were, today's vision of reality. Today, the Precession is a well-established fact. The space-time continuum does not affect it. It is by now only a boring complication. It has lost relevance for our affairs, whereas once it was the only majestic secular motion that our ancestors could keep in mind when they looked for a great cycle which could affect humanity as a whole. But then our ancestors were astronomers and astrologers. They believed that the sliding of the sun along the equinoctial point affected the frame of the cosmos and determined a succession of world-ages under different zodiacal signs. They had found a large peg on which to hang their thoughts about cosmic time, which brought all things in fateful order. Today, that order has lapsed, like the idea of the cosmos itself. There is only history, which has been felicitously defined as 'one damn thing after another.'"
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.67-68

The authors take a step further to explore the fundamental divide between archaic and modern ways of interpreting the cosmos. They argue that the key to understanding archaic thought is through astrology, a cosmic language that encapsulated their profound sense of correspondences and deterministic principles:

> "The greatest gap between archaic thinking and modern thinking is in the use of astrology. By this is not meant the common or judicial astrology which has become once again a fad and a fashion among the ignorant public, an escape from official science, and for the vulgar another kind of black art of vast prestige but with principles equally uncomprehended. It is necessary to go back to archaic times, to a universe totally unsuspecting of our science and of the experimental method on which it is founded, unaware of the awful art of separation which distinguishes the verifiable from the unverifiable. This was a time, rich in another knowledge which was later lost, that searched for other principles. It gave the lingua franca of the past. Its knowledge was of cosmic correspondences, which found their proof and seal of truth in a specific determinism, nay overdeterminism, subject to forces completely without locality."
>
> -- Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth (1969), p.74

### The Language of Mythology

The authors posited that mythology, often overlooked as mere fanciful stories, served as a complex and subtle medium for encoding this ancient wisdom. These tales, spun with cryptic symbolism, were carefully woven tapestries hiding a coded language that mirrored the cosmos' movements and cycles. This language, unlike our contemporary scientific language, expressed relationships, patterns, and correspondences rather than explicit cause-and-effect relationships.

The second form of preservation, constructions, refers to the architectural marvels of the past, whose sophistication and precision in alignment with celestial bodies still bewilder modern researchers. These constructions - from the Pyramids of Giza to Stonehenge, and from the Mayan temples to the complex layout of Angkor Wat - all reflect an acute understanding of celestial mechanics and a desire to embody these cosmic rhythms in earthly form. They stand as colossal markers of a civilization's understanding of the cosmos, aligning earthly and heavenly cycles into a harmonious, integrated whole.

The legacy of these ancient civilizations and their profound cosmic understanding continues to whisper its wisdom to us, hidden in the language of myth and the stones of ancient constructions. As we decode these messages and comprehend their significance, we might re-discover a worldview that paints a more connected, harmonious, and rhythmically flowing cosmos, echoing the complex symphony of the precession of the equinox. This understanding may invite us to reconsider our place in the cosmos, not as detached observers, but as participants in a grand, cyclic dance of celestial bodies and cosmic time.

#### Zodiacal Constructions as Time Markers

[Archaeoastronomy]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/archaeoastronomy.md" >}}), the study of how past civilizations understood phenomena in the sky and how they utilized this knowledge in their cultures, is a captivating blend of anthropology, astronomy, history, and archaeology. This discipline's foundation can be traced back to key figures like Joseph Norman Lockyer (1836–1920), who is renowned for his discovery of helium. As the founder and first editor of the influential journal *Nature*, he took an avid interest in astronomical alignments in ancient buildings, even penning *The Dawn of Astronomy - A Study of the Temple Worship and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians (1894)*[^1^], one of the earliest archaeoastronomical works.

When discussing archaeoastronomy, it is impossible to overlook the *Giza pyramid complex*—an iconic example of ancient constructions that reflect a deep understanding of celestial bodies. The pyramids mirror a non-zodiacal star constellation, and there's a statue known as the *Sphinx*, bearing a striking resemblance to Leo—the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac, possibly denoting the [Age of Leo]({{< relref "intro/timeline/age-of-leo.md" >}}). The *Pyramid of Khufu* is of particular interest because of its ability to mark the day of an equinox. This feature is a testament to the extraordinary craftsmanship and scientific sophistication of the civilization that built it.

The *Pyramid of Khufu*, also known as the *Great Pyramid*, has a unique eight-sided structure, rather than the four sides typically associated with pyramids. This design enables the sun's light to *mark* the construction when the light comes from a direct, perpendicular direction towards a given side of the pyramid. Considering the *Pyramid of Khufu*'s precise alignment with the North, there are only two days in a year—the equinoctial days—when the pyramid can be *marked* as seemingly intended.

A fascinating insight into the unusual design of the Great Pyramid comes from J.P. Lepre's comprehensive work, *The Egyptian Pyramids: A Comprehensive, Illustrated Reference (1990)*[^2^]:

> One very unusual feature of the Great Pyramid is a concavity of the core that makes the  monument  an  eight-sided  figure,  rather  than  four-sided  like  every  other Egyptian pyramid. That is to say, that its four  sides are hollowed in or indented along  their  central  lines, from  base  to  peak.  This  concavity  divides  each of  the apparent four sides in half, creating a very special and unusual eight-sided pyramid; and it is executed to such an extraordinary degree of precision as to enter the realm of the uncanny...

The *Great Pyramid* was clearly designed and built with astronomical knowledge in mind, indicating equinoctial sunrises and sunsets and marking the progression of the precession[^3^]. Furthermore, there is evidence of Zodiac symbolism within the *Giza pyramid complex*. The Sphinx, a lion-like figure, faces due East, directly towards the rising Sun on equinoctial days. This position implies the Sphinx looks at the Zodiacal constellation hiding behind the Sun at these precise moments—does this mean it is a nod to the Zodiac sign Leo?

While this interpretation may seem conjectural, the more we learn about these ancient civilizations and their understanding of the cosmos, the more plausible it becomes. The law of *Occam's razor*—that entities should not be multiplied without necessity—suggests that the more congruent factors we find in the construction of these monumental buildings, the more likely it is that this highly sophisticated astronomical knowledge has been applied universally.

## Summing It Up

The Great Year and its Twelve Houses have intriguing aspects that tie in closely with the Earth's three key motions, particularly the precession. This slow westward shift of the equinoxes along the plane of the ecliptic, resulting from the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation, causes the equinoxes to occur earlier each sidereal year. A complete precession cycle takes around `25,920 years`, marking the Great Year.

This Great Year can be divided into twelve distinct months or World Ages, each lasting `2,160 years` and corresponding to one of the constellations on the ecliptic, specifically a Zodiac sign. From `1950 AD`, Earth and its inhabitants entered the Age of Aquarius, also referred to as the Aquarian Age or the [New Age]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/golden-age.md" >}}). This understanding of World Ages seems to have persisted throughout history, encoded into folklore and monumental construction, which continues to inspire awe today.

This understanding of the cosmos that's embedded in ancient structures such as the Giza pyramids implies a civilization far advanced for its time. This notion may not conform to the traditional narrative of human progress, but it increasingly aligns with the body of knowledge unearthed through archaeoastronomy. The advanced knowledge, as demonstrated by the construction techniques, and the remarkable understanding of celestial bodies, suggest the existence of a pre-flood civilization that had mastered the art of astronomical timekeeping.

Astrological ages, as depicted in the Great Year and the Twelve Houses, provide a comprehensive chronology that has been utilized for millennia. These World Ages are not merely relics of the past, but they hold predictive power, serving as a celestial calendar of what's to come. The progression from one astrological age to the next signifies both an astronomical shift and a sociocultural transition. Each age carries its unique character, influencing the zeitgeist and the course of human development.

It's fascinating to consider that these civilizations, thousands of years in our past, possessed an understanding of time that we are only beginning to fully appreciate. They saw time not as linear but cyclical, marked by the celestial dance of stars and planets. It seems that they understood the inherent rhythms of the cosmos and our planet's place within it, a wisdom that they encoded into their greatest monuments.

This glimpse into the past serves not only as a testament to the accomplishments of these ancient civilizations, but it also invites us to see the future in a new light. As we move further into the Age of Aquarius, we might find that the knowledge held by our ancestors can guide us in navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. After all, the ancients viewed the cosmos not as a vast, empty space, but as a grand celestial clock, a timeless guide inscribed with the wisdom of ages past, present, and future.

The narrative presented here has been simplified for ease of understanding, but each topic warrants deeper exploration. Future write-ups will delve more deeply into each aspect, shedding more light on our ancestors' relationship with the cosmos.
