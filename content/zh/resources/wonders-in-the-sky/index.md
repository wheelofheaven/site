Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times" by Jacques Vallée and Chris Aubeck is a comprehensive investigation into the history of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The book examines over 500 reports of UFO sightings from ancient times up to the year 1879, a period before the profound changes brought by the Industrial Revolution and the advent of modern aircraft like airplanes and dirigibles.

The work is noted for its rigorous approach to paranormal investigation, presenting a detailed compendium of pre-twentieth-century UFO accounts. Vallée and Aubeck, both respected researchers in the field of unexplained phenomena, delve into sightings that occurred in an era when human society had not yet developed the technology to take to the skies. This historical context adds a layer of intrigue to the sightings they document, as it rules out contemporary sources of aerial phenomena like aircraft.

In addition to documenting these sightings, the book explores their impact on human culture, history, and beliefs. The accounts are not only seen as mere reports of unexplained aerial objects but are also analyzed for their cultural and historical significance, providing insights into how these sightings may have shaped human understanding and beliefs over the centuries.

"Wonders in the Sky" is acknowledged as one of the most ambitious works in the field of paranormal investigation, shedding light on a largely unexplored aspect of UFO phenomena and their place in human history​.
