The Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible, is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a significant part of Christian scriptures. It is divided into three sections: the Torah (Teaching or Law), the Nevi'im (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). The word "Tanakh" is an acronym derived from these three divisions.

- **The Torah (Law or Teaching):** Also known as the Pentateuch, the Torah comprises the first five books of the Bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These books, traditionally attributed to Moses, contain the laws and religious teachings of Judaism, including the Ten Commandments and the narrative of the Israelites from the creation of the world to their arrival in the Promised Land.

- **The Nevi'im (Prophets):** This section is divided into two parts - the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, which is a single book in the Jewish canon). These books encompass the historical narrative of the Israelites, their moral and prophetic teachings, and their relationship with God.

- **The Ketuvim (Writings):** This diverse collection includes poetry, religious hymns, philosophical discourses, and narrative stories. Key books in this section include Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles.

The Tanakh forms the theological and ethical foundation of Jewish religious practice. Its teachings guide Jewish law (Halakha), philosophy, and tradition. The Tanakh is also central to Jewish worship and is regularly studied both for its religious and moral teachings and for its cultural and historical significance.

In terms of historical context, the Tanakh was compiled over a period of centuries, with scholars generally agreeing that the final form was completed by the 2nd century BCE. The books of the Tanakh were originally written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.

The influence of the Tanakh extends far beyond Judaism; its narratives, teachings, and themes have had a profound impact on Western culture and religious thought. The Christian Old Testament is based on the Tanakh, though the order and number of books differ. The Tanakh continues to be a subject of religious and academic study, offering insight into ancient Near Eastern history, culture, and religion.
