"Science After Babel" by David Berlinski is a book that challenges the established norms and widely accepted theories in contemporary science. Berlinski, known for his deep learning, close reasoning, and sharp wit, critiques what he considers to be the shibboleths of modern science. These include widely accepted concepts in Darwinism, reductionism, the Standard Model of particle physics, and the idea of "talking" chimpanzees.

In his book, Berlinski questions the solidity of what is often passed off as secure scientific knowledge. He describes Neo-Darwinism as "empty" and makes a wry comment about the transient nature of scientific theories in general, saying, "Theories come and go." Berlinski's criticism extends to a range of contemporary authors and their works in various scientific fields, including cosmology, biology, and philosophy of biology. Among those he critiques are Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, Stephen Jay Gould, and Michael Ruse.

Berlinski's work is noted for its elegant reasoning and erudition, as well as his unique and engaging prose style. He is praised for his ability to articulate complex scientific concepts in an accessible and often beautiful way, making his work appealing not only to those interested in the science but also to readers who appreciate the literary aspect of his writing.

In his reflections, Berlinski draws parallels between the current state of the scientific enterprise and Bruegel’s Tower of Babel. He suggests that while science is undoubtedly an impressive endeavor, it has failed to reach the lofty heights it promised a century ago. This comparison implies that science, much like the Tower of Babel, has become a bloated and vain enterprise, losing sight of its original goals and principles.

"Science After Babel" thus presents a critical and thought-provoking view of modern science, questioning the validity of certain scientific "truths" and urging a re-evaluation of what is often accepted without question in the scientific community​.
