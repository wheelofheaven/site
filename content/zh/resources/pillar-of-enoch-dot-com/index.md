### Description

The following excerpt was directly taken from Helena Lehman's website:

> Messianic Christian Scholar Helena Lehman’s ministry features the Language of God Book Series and Pillar of Enoch Trilogy books and free articles discussing the Language of God hidden within the Gospel in the Stars. See how the Signs in the Heavens surrounding Orion, Draco, Taurus and Scorpio reveal the meaning behind the Mayan date 13 Baktun or December 21, 2012, and the Sign in the Heavens between 2008 and 2019. Also see how the Great Pyramid, the Great Sphinx, the Desert Tabernacle, Stonehenge, the pyramids at Teotihuacán, the statues of Easter Island, Hawaii, Alaska, Tibet, the temples at Angkor and the Ark of the Covenant are tied to the 48 constellations of the ancient Zodiac. Discover the truth behind the mysterious prophecies hidden in the nine Jewish Feasts and the Prophecies in Psalms 110 thru 118 that may be tied to the Great Tribulation. Also see how the Star Gospel can help to decipher prophecies in the Book of Revelation concerning the Woman Clothed with the Sun, the Beasts from the Sea and the Earth, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and their connection to the celestial signs in the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars between 2008 and 2019.
