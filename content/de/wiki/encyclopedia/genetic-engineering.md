title: "Gentechnik"
description: "Genetic engineering is a scientific discipline that involves the deliberate modification of an organism's genetic material, typically its DNA, to introduce new traits or characteristics. It encompasses techniques used to manipulate genes and genetic elements, such as gene insertion, deletion, or modification, to alter the genetic makeup of an organism. Genetic engineering enables scientists to transfer specific genes between different species, create genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or introduce desired traits into organisms for various purposes, including improving crop yields, developing medical treatments, or producing useful products."
