title: "Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth's Lost Civilization"
description: "\"Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth's Lost Civilization\" by Graham Hancock, published in 1995, explores the hypothesis of a highly advanced civilization existing in prehistory, serving as the progenitor of all known ancient civilizations. Hancock proposes that this civilization, centered around Antarctica, ended catastrophically at the end of the last ice age but passed on significant knowledge in astronomy, architecture, and mathematics. The evidence for this lost civilization, according to Hancock, is found in ancient Egypt and American civilizations like the Olmec, Aztec, and Maya. He discusses various creation myths and archaeological sites, such as Tiwanaku in Bolivia, to support his theory."

"Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth's Lost Civilization" by Graham Hancock, published in 1995, explores the hypothesis of a highly advanced civilization existing in prehistory, serving as the progenitor of all known ancient civilizations. Hancock proposes that this civilization, centered around Antarctica, ended catastrophically at the end of the last ice age but passed on significant knowledge in astronomy, architecture, and mathematics. The evidence for this lost civilization, according to Hancock, is found in ancient Egypt and American civilizations like the Olmec, Aztec, and Maya. He discusses various creation myths and archaeological sites, such as Tiwanaku in Bolivia, to support his theory.

Hancock also explores the pole-shift hypothesis based on Charles Hapgood's theory of Earth Crustal Displacement, suggesting that around 10,450 BC, a major shift positioned Antarctica at its current location, potentially leading to the destruction of this ancient civilization. This hypothesis, though not supported in the geological community, is central to Hancock's exploration of a lost civilization, possibly Atlantis​.
