"The Sacred City" is a Dokumentarfilm by Dan Gibson that presents a provocative and alternative perspective on the early history of Islam and its sacred geography. Gibson, a historical researcher, embarks on a quest to investigate the origins of Islam, challenging the conventional narrative about the birthplace of the religion.

The central thesis of Gibson's documentary is the controversial claim that the Islamic holy city of Mecca, as known today, was not the original location mentioned in early Islamic texts. He argues that the descriptions of Mecca in early Islamic scriptures do not align with the geographical and archaeological realities of the current city. Instead, Gibson suggests that the original holy site of Islam was located in Petra, in modern-day Jordan.

Throughout the documentary, Gibson meticulously examines archaeological evidence, ancient manuscripts, and architectural remnants to support his theory. He points out discrepancies in the directional alignment of early mosques, which, according to his research, face Petra rather than Mecca. This finding is crucial to his argument, as the Qibla, or the direction towards which Muslims pray, is a fundamental aspect of Islamic practice.

Gibson delves into the historical context of the early Islamic period, exploring how the city of Petra, a major trading hub and a cultural melting pot, could have been a more likely setting for the emergence of Islam. He examines the city's religious significance in pre-Islamic times, its architectural wonders like the Al-Khazneh temple, and its strategic location along ancient trade routes.

The documentary also explores the possible reasons for the shift of the sacred city from Petra to Mecca, suggesting political, religious, and social factors that might have influenced this change. Gibson hypothesizes that the relocation could have been a strategic move by Islamic leaders to consolidate power or to distance the religion from its pre-Islamic roots.

"The Sacred City" challenges viewers to reconsider accepted historical narratives and invites a re-examination of Islamic history. Gibson's work is a call for further research and dialogue in the academic community, urging historians and archaeologists to look beyond traditional sources and consider alternative evidence in understanding the past.
