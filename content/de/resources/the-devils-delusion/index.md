In "The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretensions," David Berlinski mounts a vigorous critique of scientific atheism, particularly addressing the assertions made by figures like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. Berlinski, a secular Jew and mathematician, questions the completeness and authority of science in answering profound existential and moral questions.

Berlinski argues that the science often cited by atheists to debunk religious beliefs actually does not conclusively negate the possibility of a divine existence. He highlights the limitations of scientific theories, especially in fields like quantum mechanics and relativity, in explaining the origins and nature of the universe, and he points out that these theories lack comprehensive empirical verifiability. Berlinski expresses skepticism towards Darwinian evolutionary theory, questioning its ability to fully explain the complexity of life and the emergence of human consciousness.

Moreover, Berlinski challenges the idea that a secular, rationalist approach can provide a robust foundation for morality. He suggests that objective morality might indeed require a religious underpinning, countering the claim that moral understanding can be achieved purely through rational thought.

Despite his critiques, Berlinski does not completely dismiss the achievements of Western science. He acknowledges the importance of scientific theories as significant human accomplishments but argues that they fall short in addressing the profound questions traditionally explored by religion.

Controversially, Berlinski's book raises questions about his own religious beliefs. Despite his defense of religious thought, Berlinski himself is not religious, leading to discussions about the sincerity and motivation behind his arguments. His book is seen as a response to the rise of militant atheism and the dismissal of religious belief by prominent thinkers in the scientific community. It has been described as well-informed, pointed, and entertaining, offering a perspective that is both critical of scientific atheism and reflective of a broader intellectual discourse on the intersection of science and religionâ€‹.
