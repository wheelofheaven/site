Ye recently posted a tweet that got him banned (again) from Twitter. Superifically, it looks a lot like some sort of provocation, that is tweeting a picture featuring what appears to be combining two seemingly opposing symbols. Two symbols that carry heavy historical connotations. "Love everyone. #lovespeech" wrote Ye alongside his provoking tweet. What one may not know however (and what Ye himself may have not known either) is that this intertwined synthetization of two ostensibly unrelated, opposing symbols was not a new creation by Ye or someone affiliated. This symbol has already been in use for some time. The merging of the Shield of David and the Swastika represents infinity in the Raëlian theology. Indeed a symbol that colloquially equated with love among Raëlians. While Raëlian claim that symbol as their religious emblem, they are also very clear about its origin, namely that they haven't invented it either, but it is deeply entrenched in our historical past and has been used by multiple important civilizations a long time ago.

### Ye's Tweet

Yesterday, on the 2nd of December 2022, Ye posted the following Tweet on Twitter:

This is interesting as it may be the first time that a well-known celebrity showcases the Raëlian symbol so obviously so that one may ask what this may actually represent.  

### Fact

Yes, the screenshot portraying a computer screen showing an open Adobe Photoshop window which itself displays a weird looking symbol in black on white background. That symbol clearly has the shape of the infamous Star of David, also called Magen David (shield of David) featuring an interconnected Swastika in its center. Without going as far as to interpret what Ye, formlery Kanye West was trying to express, what he was showing is nothing else, but the emblematic symbol of the Raëlian religion. A new religious movement that got started in 1973 by a Frenchman. This religion and its premises is at the very underlying narrative that this very web site you'reading, Wheel of Heaven, tries to uncover.

### Explanation

In the Raëlian theology, more specifically Raëlian cosmology, what we commonly refer as to the universe is considered infinite in size and in scale: infinite space without any relevant borders. Space doesn't end where we think it does, it keeps on being bigger and larger than any we can image. Infinity of space so to speak. Not only that, but space consitsts multiple levels of scale. If the entirey of our known universe is part of an even bigger being, then that scale of existence is higher up so to speak. If that is true for the highest scale, it would be conducive to consider the very same analogy to work for the smallest scales. And indeed, for Raëlians, we are these larger beings for much smaller worlds living in a scale even smaller than sub-atomic particles. As above so below goes the Hermetic saying which takes a new dimension within Raëlian theology. This relationship between smaller and larger scales of existence is the very meaning of the Star of David.

The interlaced Swastika within the Raëlian symbol of infinity represents cyclical nature of an infinite timeline. Combined together, Magen David representing the infinity of space, "as above, so below" and the Swastika representing the infinity of time are utlimately symbolizing the infity of time and space.

### Dive deeper

If you want to learn more about what the Raëlian symbol of infinity means and what the Raëlian religion teaches, then you're in the right place as we at Wheel of Heaven research the very premises of Raëlism as the only existing embodiment of a system of thought that asserts that the Creation myth of Genesis AND the non-existence of an immaterial god as equally true.
