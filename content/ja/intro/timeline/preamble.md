タイムラインは約22,000年前、すなわち摩羯宮の時代の門戸の直前から始まります。摩羯宮の時代に先立つのは、前の大年の水瓶宮の時代です。摩羯宮の世界時代、つまり最初の歳差の大月を始める前に、それに先立つ出来事を調査する価値があります。それが何だったのかを説明するために、アメリカ映画業界の古典、ジュラシックパークからインスピレーションを得ることができます。

## 傲慢、あるいは勇敢？

あなたはスティーブン・スピルバーグによる古典的な映画シリーズ、ジュラシックパークを観たことがありますか？[^1] 私たちは、映画の設定とフィクションの設定を、宇宙の探検家、惑星のテラフォーマー、生命の創造者たちの旅の出発点として使用します。最初の映画では、裕福で成功した起業家ジョン・ハモンドと彼の優秀な科学者チームが、クローニングと遺伝子工学を使って恐竜を生き返らせることを紹介します。映画では、化石化していない琥珀に閉じ込められた古代の蚊がまだ一部の爬虫類の血を部分的に保持しており、これがDNA抽出の基礎となります。DNAを補完するために、推測的なプロセスを通じてカエルのDNAでギャップが埋められます。これにより、科学者たちは長い間絶滅していた恐竜を再生し、それを中米の島のテーマパークで世界中からの訪問者に披露します。

しかし、恐竜が自由になり混乱を引き起こすと、物事はうまくいかなくなりますが、主要キャラクターたちは困難に立ち向かい、映画の最後に救出チームによって救出されます。このパターンはシリーズ全体で続きます。この映画シリーズは、マイケル・クライトンの1990年の同名の小説に触発された科学的進歩と人間の傲慢に対する懐疑的な視点で知られています。

ここでの接続点は、ヤハウェがラエルに明らかにしたことに基づく[Wheel of Heaven の仮説]({{< relref "intro/at-a-glance/the-hypothesis.md" >}})によれば、摩羯宮の時代の開始時に起こったことは、ジュラシックパークのページから直接取られたかのようなものであるということです。このシナリオでは、ビジョナリーな科学者のグループが遺伝子工学を通じて新しく、潜在的に危険な種を作り出し、それが最終的には災厄の結果をもたらし、彼らの研究を危険にさらす。

[^1]: ジュラシックパークはスティーブン・スピルバーグが監督した映画ですが、実際にはマイケル・クライトンの同名の小説に基づいています。この本は1990年に初めて出版され、遺伝子操作で作られた恐竜が生息するテーマパークの物語を描いています。本は遺伝子工学の倫理的および科学的な含意、および自然と遊ぶ危険性を探求しています。映画版の「ジュラシックパーク」は1993年に公開され、大成功を収めました。この映画は小説の物語を広く伝え、多くの人々に遺伝子操作で作られた恐竜の概念を紹介しました。ジュラシックパークの映画版は小説といくつかの点で異なりますが、本のテーマに忠実であり、多くの同じ倫理的および科学的な問題を探求しています。詳しくはこちらを参照してください：[ジュラシックパーク（小説）| Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel))

## 昔々

明らかに、ジュラシックパークはフィクションであり、最近、絶滅した種または新しい生命種を合成したというニュースで研究機関が取り上げられることはありません。今から話すことになる出来事は、全く異なる日と時代に位置付けられるべきです。

前章で指摘したように、[仮説]({{< relref "intro/at-a-glance/the-hypothesis.md" >}})で、我々は、ラエリアン教の三冊の創設書が示す物語を、正典として認識しています[^2]。これらの本は、神々と誤解されてきた永遠の者たちの評議会の首代表である[ヤハウェ]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/yahweh.md" >}})と、フランス人との一連の出会いを記録したものです。この評議会の永遠の者たちは、我々が一般的に[エロヒム]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/elohim.md" >}})と記憶している宇宙文明の政府機関として最も適しています。このフランス人は、地球の大使としての役割を指すラエルという名前を与えられ、新たな宗教運動である[ラエリアン教]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/raelism.md" >}})[^3]を形成しました。新設された運動の主な目標の一つは、ヤハウェによって委託されたメッセージを保管、翻訳し、受け入れる耳に伝えることです。これらのメッセージの中で、ヤハウェは神の概念を神秘化し、宗教の意味を改訂し、聖書の創世記の創造物語を詳細に再話します。

その一つの再話の中で、ヤハウェは地球への彼らの到着の開始を位置付けるための重要な時間的手がかりを与えます。

> 約22,000年前、あなたたちの創造に先立ち、我々は地球に到着しました。[^4]

[^2]: ラエリアン運動の創設書は、彼らの指導者であるラエル（本名：クロード・ヴォリロン）によって書かれた三冊の本で構成されています。それらは「地球の使者たち」（1974年）、「終わりの書」（1975年）、「宇宙の人間の永遠の生命」（2003年）です。

[^3]: ラエリアン教は、1970年代にラエルによって創設された新興宗教です。この宗教は、地球上の生命が宇宙から来た科学者たちによって創造され、これらの科学者が聖書で言及される「神」であると主張します。ラエリアン教は、自己の開発、愛、個々の自由、そして全ての生命の尊重を強調します。

## On a distant planet

The narrative as recorded during the encounters between Raël and Yahweh is for the most part a commentary on the Biblical scriptures. In an exegetical manner[^5], Yahweh recollects what happened in the beginning, during Genesis[^6]. However, before he starts commenting on the Biblical passages, he establishes a prologue to the events described in [Genesis]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/genesis.md" >}}). That prologue brings us back to Jurassic Park.

The story of the Elohim evidently doesn't start on planet Earth. They originate from another planet, an [Elohimian home planet]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/elohimian-home-planet.md" >}}). Yahweh starts off the story with remembering what preceded the events Genesis and eventually lead to them:

> A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.
>
> The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people. [...]

The parallels with the Jurassic Park lore is staggering. We note that some 24'000 years ago, on a distant planet, the Elohimian home planet, its inhabitants managed to develop a civilization capable of [artifical gene synthesis de novo]({{< relref "wiki/encyclopedia/synthetic-biology.md#artifical-gene-synthesis" >}})[^7]. These advancements of genetic engineering lead them to synthetically engineer new life forms. Ulimately, that branch of research of synthetic life engineering ended in a fateful casuality where some of these synthetically created animals broke loose and did kill many people.

We must imagine how a civilization similar to ours, even if slightly more advanced and developed, would react to experimental research like that. Especially considering that the concerns voiced by an eminent faction among the populace, deeming that kind of research to be distateful, objectionable and most importantly dangerous proved to be appropriate. In our day and age, abundant with controversies and mistrust towards executive and leading institutions, a research project of the same magnitude, if it were to become a public matter, would most likely provoke a similar amount of criticism and politicization. The very popularity of the Jurassic Park franchise is a telling indicator on how arguments would be made.

The franchise explores the dangers of playing God through the use of genetic engineering to bring extinct species back to life. In the first Jurassic Park movie for instance, the character Dr. Ian Malcolm warns of the dangers of genetic engineering and the risks of creating genetically modified organisms that can potentially escape and wreak havoc on the world. He argues that the scientists behind the creation of the park were so preoccupied with whether or not they could create dinosaurs, they never stopped to think if they should.

The subsequent films in the franchise also continue to explore the consequences of genetic engineering, such as the development of hybrid dinosaurs with unpredictable and dangerous behaviors. Through these themes, the Jurassic Park franchise critiques the potential for science to be used for destructive purposes and emphasizes the importance of responsible scientific research and development.

What happened after these _monsters_ broke free? The second part of the prologue as recounted by Yahweh finished with the following sentence:

> [...] Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments.

This brings us back to Jurassic Park lore once more. In the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park movies, Jurassic World (2015), the female lead character Claire Dearing mentions the possibility of the space program being as profitable as dinosaur-based theme parks[^8]. Although the movie is fictional, this detail is intriguing. The writers suggests that in a society as advanced as the one depicted in the film, genetic engineering and space travel could potentially develop concurrently.

Apparently, this concurrency did happen for the Elohimian civilization. Considering our own pace of scientific and technological progress of the past few decades, it isn't too much of a stretch to imagine that a sophisticated state of genetic engineering capabilities, where life synthetization is possible, coincides with interplanetary and interstellar space travel capabilities in terms of civilizational progress[^9]. It is also reasonable to assume that a civilization like ours that just entered the age of space travel wouldn't have fully overcome resource and energy scarcity. While such a civilization must be thriving and abundant in problem solving technologies and research, it would also be likely to incentivize and foster progress through a credit system. The point being that genetic engineering and space travel as industries and fields of research must be very lucrative and highly incentivized in such a civilization that just made the technological leap of creating the means to travel in space and create new life from scratch.

The consistency of the narrative allegedly put forward by Yahweh himself is in the realm of the conceivable. While in our day and age, we clearly haven't achieved nor mastered in the least any of these leaps in technology, these things cannot be considered fictional anymore, but almost seem in reach. Only 50 years ago, when these revelations were made to Raël, the Apollo program just came to put men on the moon and James Watson Francis Crick discovered the double helix structure of the DNA two decades before that. Science and especially applied science has come a long way since, what used to be science-fiction only 50 years ago became reality. Let's just consider for a minute what is possible in the next 50 years, let alone 100 years from now on...

[^9]: The idea that reviving extinct creatures like dinosaurs through genetic engineering may happen at the same time as space travel becoming possible is based on the idea that both fields of science and technology are advancing rapidly. The connection between these two fields lies in the fact that they both involve exploring the boundaries of what is possible and pushing the limits of what we can achieve as a species. While it is difficult to predict the future of these fields with certainty, it is reasonable to think that both genetic engineering and space travel will continue to advance in the coming decades and may lead to significant scientific and technological breakthroughs.

## To Earth

The prologue doesn't end there. After the genetic experiments became polemic and consequently were halted therefrom on the Elohimian home planet, space exploration lead to new interplanetary and interstellar frontiers. A complete new class of possibilities opened for them.

Right after the aforementioned passage, Yahweh goes on and adds what ties us to them:

> They chose Earth where you live.

Earth, a barren but material planet devoid of life proved to be the frontier they were looking for. Who is _they_ though? _They_ refers to brave ones among the Elohimian civilization that were willing to travel long distances in the vicinity of their home planet and push the boundaries of what was previously considered the realm of the unchartered and the unknown. But who in particular could these brave ones have been? The Raëlian canon does offer partial answers to this question. At this stage of the narration however, let us speculate on the nature of that may have been the incentives to go such great lengths to get a better grip on the matter. These speculations will give us a better understanding of the conditions in which these events evolved in.

[^5]: The practice of exegesis equates to critically explain or interpret a religious text. In simple terms, exegesis refers to the process of discovering the original and intended meaning of a passage of scripture. This is precisely what Yahweh does as described in the foundational works of Raëlism. Yahweh comments on Biblical passages and explains how these passages should be understood.
[^6]: The Biblical Book of Genesis is called Bereshith (בְּרֵאשִׁית) in the Hebraic Torah, literally meaning "in the beginning" in Hebrew. This is because in the Hewbrew Bible, books are named using incipits. The first words in first book of the Hebrew Bible is Bereshit ("In the beginning ..."). See more: [Incipit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incipit)
[^7]: De novo gene synthesis is a process where a DNA sequence is artificially created from scratch, without the need for an existing DNA template. Essentially, it is like writing a new genetic code from scratch. See more: [De novo synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis)
[^8]: In the movie Jurassic World (2015), the idea of space travel is briefly mentioned as a competing business of dinosaur theme parks. The movie is set about 22 years after the events of the original Jurassic Park, and it depicts a fully operational dinosaur theme park called Jurassic World. The character who suggests the space-themed ride notes that people are now more interested in space travel than in seeing dinosaurs. This idea reflects the changing interests and priorities of society over time.

## The economy of science

We already pointed out that is reasonable to assume that the Elohimian civilization during that stage of development was likely to still be governed by an economical system predicated on the scarcity of resources and of energy where a credit system must have been in place allocating productive means to those best suited for the job. Also, we know that the public opinion which was responsible for halting the experimental research of genetic engineering had shown enough influence to sway legislative and most likely executive power in their favour. Some sort ofpolitical system with a republic component, where the _Rēs pūblica_, the matter of the people is considered, can also be assumed.

With these two assumptions, which indeed mirror a lot our own economical and political conditions of the 21st century, we can venture to speculate that researchers that were responsible for the research and development of synthetic engineering must have worked on behalf of a quasi-corporative social institution (which we may or may not call an enterprise). That institution must have more likely than not benefitted from the affluence of bright minds and power that came along with their scientific insights.

One can only wonder what economical side-effects that kind of promising research must have generated. The capability of reverse engineering genetic code to the extend of being able to write new genetic code as one does write software source code today. The ability to compile and integrate genetic code with nothing but chemical source components as one does transpile source code into machine code today. To fully understand and emulate new features with a given set of decoded genes is not unlike what some tech wizards do when reading source code nowadays and then come up with ways to extend the repository of functionalities with a set of new features. These tech wizards, more commonly referred to as software engineers and software architects, are famous pushing the boundaries of what technology is capable of and make not little of a living out of it.

If we extend these principles not only to machine code that is run on digital computing units, but to the machinery that is biological life, the possibilities that can be deduced therefrom are dizzying. Pharmaceutical products of all kinds, the healing of kinds of diseases and life-reducing hardships, the extension of the life span and even the preservation of life itself beyond death become viable. The Elohimian civilization must have truly entered a Golden Age on their own with the development of such technology.

The coalition of enterprises that were responsible for the embetterment of life's condition for everybody that was willing to consume and able to afford their products, the confluence of knowledge and power must have been noteworthy to say the least. The circumstance that the legacy of whoever made the progress of genetic engineering possible also is also the foundations of what lead to the creation of synthetic monster that broke free and caused havoc must have been even more noteworthy and likely to be highly polemical in their days.

Nonetheless, the wealth of power generated from the benefits of genetical engineering most likely have had a direct impact on how the Elohimian civilization was funding and allocating resources to the cause of space exploration. The affinity shared by both causes is strongly conducive to the idea that similar agents, to not say individuals, must have contributed to both the these causes.

## The Eternal

At the end of the first book out of the three foundational works of Raëlism, [The Book Which Tells The Truth]({{< relref "resources/the-book-which-tells-the-truth.md" >}})<sup>📖</sup>, Yahweh reveals who he is and what makes him being the main representative of the Elohim:

> The oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.

There we have it. Yahweh was the first one to enjoy the fruits of the scientific progress. The Elohimian civilization developed and perfected a technique that enabled them to inhabit multiple bodies through scientific means, therefore rendering the individuals willing to have this technique applied to them to become veritably immortal. Given the cumulated age of 25'000 years, we can safely park the invention of the techniques of immortality chronologically before the dawn of the Age of Capricorn and therefore before their arrival on planet Earth.

## A quick recap

The Age of Capricorn is one of the twelve World Ages and started at –21'810, lasted as each World Age 2'160 years. Before that period of time, the Elohim, an extraterrestrial civilization, arrived on Earth. Motivated by a tragic incident involving the escape of one of their genetic experiments, which resulted in the loss of Elohimian lifes and the cessation of that branch of research on their home planet, the Elohim sought new interstellar frontiers. Pursuing interplanetary and interstellar exploration, the researchers eventually chose Earth, an exoplanet, as their frontier for genetic research.

The establishement of a new exoplanetary frontier on Earth gets the precessional clock work of the unfolding of the World Ages going. With the arrival of the Elohim on planet Earth begins the onset of the Age of Capricorn (from –21'810 to –19'650).
