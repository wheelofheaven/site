The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Scriptures resource offers a comprehensive collection of religious texts central to the faith, including the Old Testament, New Testament, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and various study aids and proclamations. The history of these scriptures reveals a dynamic process of compilation, revision, and enhancement to make these sacred texts accessible and relevant to its members.

Key milestones in the history of these scriptures include the commissioning of the King James Version of the Bible by King James I, the translation and subsequent revisions of the Book of Mormon initiated by Joseph Smith, and the compilation of Joseph Smith's revelations into the Book of Commandments, which later evolved into the Doctrine and Covenants​. Over the years, these texts have been subject to various updates and revisions to correct errors, improve clarity, and update language. Notable revisions include Elder Orson Pratt's adjustments to the Doctrine and Covenants in 1876 and the canonization of the Pearl of Great Price as the Church's fourth standard work in 1878​.

In the late 20th century, the Church undertook significant efforts to publish its own editions of these scriptures, incorporating study aids to deepen understanding and facilitate engagement with the texts​​. The most recent revisions, in 2013, focused on minor textual corrections and updates to study aids, underscoring the Church's ongoing effort to keep its scriptures relevant and accessible​​.
