_Hard to Be a God_ (1989) is a West German-Soviet-French-Swiss science fiction film directed by Peter Fleischmann, based on the novel of the same name by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The film is set on a distant planet that mirrors Earth's Middle Ages, where society has not progressed beyond a primitive, feudal state. This alien world is being observed by Earth scientists posing as noble feudal lords.

The central character, Anton, is one of the scientists sent from Earth. He grapples with the moral dilemma of whether to intervene in the brutal and oppressive societal practices he witnesses or adhere to the non-interference policy of the Earth scientists. Anton's struggle is intensified by his growing attachment to the inhabitants of this alien world and his disillusionment with the observers' mission.

_Hard to Be a God_ delves into themes of power, morality, and the consequences of intervention in a society's natural development. The film poses profound questions about the role of advanced civilizations in influencing the course of less developed societies. It challenges the viewer to consider the ethical implications of wielding power over a society that is unaware of its true nature and origin.

The film's narrative is enriched by its stark and atmospheric visual style, which vividly portrays the grim and oppressive environment of the alien world. This stylistic choice amplifies the film's exploration of the heavy burden borne by those who possess advanced knowledge and the capacity to influence the course of an entire society.
