In his paper "A Gentleman’s Joyous Esotericism: Jean Sendy Above and Beyond the Ancient Aliens," Stefano Bigliardi discusses the work of Jean Sendy, a French esoteric writer who explored the idea of ancient astronauts and extraterrestrial intervention in human history. Bigliardi provides an overview of Sendy's life and work, including his theories on the origins of humanity, the influence of extraterrestrial beings, and the possible connections between various mythologies and ancient cultures.

Bigliardi argues that while Sendy's ideas are often associated with the contemporary "ancient aliens" movement, his work is more nuanced and sophisticated than the simplistic and often sensationalist claims of some modern authors. Sendy drew on a wide range of sources, including mythology, ancient texts, and scientific theories, to develop his ideas. He also emphasized the need for critical thinking and careful analysis of evidence, rather than simply accepting or rejecting theories based on preconceived notions.

Overall, Bigliardi suggests that Sendy's work is an interesting and valuable contribution to the study of esotericism and the search for meaning in human history, and encourages readers to engage with his ideas in a thoughtful and critical manner.

### Abstract

The paper was published in September 2016, focusing on the works and ideologies of Jean Sendy, a French author. It delves into a bibliography of Sendy's works, highlighting titles such as "Les cahiers de cours de Moïse," "La lune clé de la Bible," "Nous autres, gens du Moyen Age," and "L’ère du Verseau, fin de l’illusion humaniste."

Jean Sendy proposed various theories and interpretations about ancient civilizations and their interactions with extraterrestrial beings, which he referred to as "Theosites." He theorized that certain ancient monuments, like the Pyramids, the archaeological remains in Tihuanaco, Bolivia, and the Temple of Baalbek in Lebanon, might have been constructed using advanced techniques introduced by these extraterrestrial entities.

Central to Sendy's narrative is the idea that Theosites visited Earth, imparting their knowledge to humans. This wisdom was preserved as a "Tradition" by select civilizations, leading to their flourishing. In contrast, those who strayed from this Tradition encountered adversities.

The document also touches upon the influences on Sendy's work. It suggests that he might have drawn inspiration from other authors and thinkers, including Matest Mendeleiev Agrest and Alexander Kazantsev, who also ventured into theories about extraterrestrials and ancient human history.

On a side note, Sendy's own interpretation of world history, especially the conflict between Nazism and Catholicism, is explored. Having lived through the atrocities of Nazi Germany, these experiences deeply influenced his writings. He perceived Catholicism as a beacon of rationality and was critical of ideologies like Communism, Nazism, and capitalism.

This is a quote directly taken from the paper's abstract itself:

> The article reconstructs the narratives advanced by the author Jean Sendy (1910-1978). His life is reconstructed as well. It is argued that Sendy was a cultivated, sophisticated and ironic author, deeply different, by virtue of his books’ quality, from other proponents of the “ancient aliens” narratives with whom he is often paired.
