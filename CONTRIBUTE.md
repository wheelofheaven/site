# How to contribute

The web presence is still under heavy development. Things still ought to change. Where we could use some help is with translation work.

## Target languages

For now, we are planning on fully translating the original content from English into the following languages

- German
- French
- Spanish
- Japanese
- Russian
- Chinese

## How to help translate

We use a static page generator that generate html markup language from markdown markup language. These files contain the content written in English that need to be translated. Open one of these content files that you want to translate. If it doesn't exist, create it with the same naming as in English. Commit the change through git and open a pull request which we're going to approve if the translations are meeting our requirements of quality.

## How to submit correction/modification requests

Same process as described in the last point. Please, open a pull request for any modification request that you deem important.
