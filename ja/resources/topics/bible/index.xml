The book explores the idea that entities described in these stories, which we would today classify as extraterrestrial beings (ETs), have played a significant role in human history. Wallis takes the reader on a global journey, from Senate briefings in Washington DC to secret ceremonies in southern Africa, and from strange phenomena in Australia and Iraq to mysterious encounters in modern Brazil and ancient Greece.</description></item><item><title>Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis teach that the human race was created by God or engineered by ETs?</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/escaping-from-eden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/escaping-from-eden/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Escaping from Eden&amp;rdquo; by Paul Wallis is a book that reexamines the stories of the Book of Genesis. Wallis suggests that anomalies in the text indicate we are not reading the original versions of these stories. He explores what the original narratives might have been, particularly regarding human origins, which he believes were almost obliterated from the Hebrew Scriptures in the 6th century BC and suppressed in Christian writings in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.</description></item><item><title>Is Genesis History?</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/is-genesis-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/is-genesis-history/</guid><description>Is Genesis History?&amp;quot; is a 2017 American film directed by Thomas Purifoy Jr., which presents the perspective of Young Earth creationism. This form of creation science challenges established scientific facts regarding the origins of the universe, Earth, solar system, and life itself, advocating for a literal interpretation of the biblical narratives. The film posits that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days and supports the Genesis accounts of Adam and Eve, the fall, a global flood, and the Tower of Babel.</description></item><item><title>Mazzaroth | The Alpha and the Omega</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/mazzaroth-dot-com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/mazzaroth-dot-com/</guid><description>Jim A. Cornwell&amp;rsquo;s website, mazzaroth.com, offers a detailed exploration of the interplay between the zodiac, biblical narratives, and ancient civilizations. It delves into the correlations of zodiac symbols with biblical patriarchs, interprets the creation story in Genesis in relation to astronomical events, and examines the historical and astronomical connections to various periods, such as the Bronze Age and Egyptian Dynasties. The site also explores themes like the New Age, the Antichrist, and biblical prophecies of tribulation, linking these concepts to astronomical interpretations and the concept of completeness symbolized by the number twelve.</description></item><item><title>Mazzaroth; or, The constellations</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/mazzaroth-rolleston/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/mazzaroth-rolleston/</guid><description>Frances Rolleston&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;Mazzaroth; or, The Constellations,&amp;rdquo; explores the significance and symbolism of the constellations in the context of divine revelation and biblical prophecy. She contends that the constellations hold a deeper, spiritual meaning that has been obscured by associations with pagan mythology and a lack of understanding of their original intent.
Rolleston argues that the constellations and their names, which are known worldwide and throughout history, point to a common origin both for humanity and these celestial symbols.</description></item><item><title>Science After Babel</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/science-after-babel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/science-after-babel/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Science After Babel&amp;rdquo; by David Berlinski is a book that challenges the established norms and widely accepted theories in contemporary science. Berlinski, known for his deep learning, close reasoning, and sharp wit, critiques what he considers to be the shibboleths of modern science. These include widely accepted concepts in Darwinism, reductionism, the Standard Model of particle physics, and the idea of &amp;ldquo;talking&amp;rdquo; chimpanzees.
In his book, Berlinski questions the solidity of what is often passed off as secure scientific knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Sefaria: A Living Library of Torah</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/sefaria/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/sefaria/</guid><description>Sefaria, founded in 2011 by journalist Joshua Foer and Brett Lockspeiser, a former product manager at Google, is a remarkable digital library of Jewish texts.

Il grande inganno&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;The Bible is Not a Sacred Book. The Great Deception&amp;rdquo;) by Mauro Biglino presents a controversial view of the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. Biglino argues that the Bible does not contain a spiritually understood divinity and that there is no worship directed towards God in it. He questions the traditional understanding of the Bible, raising issues like the multiple versions of the Bible, the unknown authors and time of its writing, the real nature of the Tree of Life, and the idea that humans are genetically modified organisms (GMOs).</description></item><item><title>The Bible of La Pleiade</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/la-bible-of-la-pleiade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ja/resources/la-bible-of-la-pleiade/</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;La Bible: Ancient Testament (tome 1 et 2)&amp;rdquo; from La Pléiade publisher, translated by Édouard Dhorme, Franck Michaéli, and Antoine Guillaumont, offers a comprehensive look at the Old Testament.

Berlinski, a secular Jew and mathematician, questions the completeness and authority of science in answering profound existential and moral questions.
Berlinski argues that the science often cited by atheists to debunk religious beliefs actually does not conclusively negate the possibility of a divine existence.</description></item></channel></rss>
