The book offers a complete and harmonious vision of the Hebrew tradition, tracing its evolution from its beginnings to the present day. Safran highlights the unity and continuity within Jewish tradition, emphasizing how divisions between law and freedom, intelligence and sensitivity, appear artificial in the context of Kabbalah.</description></item></channel></rss>
