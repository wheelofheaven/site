These texts, stemming from the Hellenistic period, are foundational to the tradition of Hermeticism, which blends elements of mysticism, astrology, alchemy, and philosophy. The Hermetica encompasses a wide range of writings, varying in style and content, but generally focused on esoteric wisdom, the nature of the divine, and the path to spiritual enlightenment.</description></item><item><title>The Kabbalah: Law and Mysticism in the Jewish Tradition</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/the-kabbalah-law-and-mysticism-in-the-jewish-tradition-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/the-kabbalah-law-and-mysticism-in-the-jewish-tradition-/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The Kabbalah: Law and Mysticism in the Jewish Tradition&amp;rdquo; (simply &amp;ldquo;La Kabbale&amp;rdquo; in French, its original title) by Alexandre Safran is a comprehensive exploration of Jewish mysticism and tradition, transcending a purely analytical study of Jewish esotericism. The book offers a complete and harmonious vision of the Hebrew tradition, tracing its evolution from its beginnings to the present day. Safran highlights the unity and continuity within Jewish tradition, emphasizing how divisions between law and freedom, intelligence and sensitivity, appear artificial in the context of Kabbalah.</description></item></channel></rss>
