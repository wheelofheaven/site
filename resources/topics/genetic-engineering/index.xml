The narrative revolves around three main characters: Daniel, a successful comedian disillusioned with his hedonistic lifestyle and the state of society, and his two clones, who lead a hermit-like existence in a post-apocalyptic future. This future world is depicted as one where the human species, ravaged by climate change and nuclear war, has either regressed to hunter-gatherer societies or is on the brink of extinction.</description></item></channel></rss>
