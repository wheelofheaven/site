The series, produced by ITN Productions and highly watched upon release, suggests that this civilization was destroyed in a cataclysm and its survivors introduced agriculture, monumental architecture, and astronomy to hunter-gatherers around the world. Hancock contends that various ancient monuments are evidence of this civilization and accuses archaeologists of ignoring or covering up this alleged evidence.</description></item><item><title>Avesta</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/book-of-enoch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/book-of-enoch/</guid><description>The Avesta is the holy scripture of Zoroastrianism, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest monotheistic religions.
