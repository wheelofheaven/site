# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Please follow these steps:

- Do Not Publicize the Vulnerability: Sharing the vulnerability publicly can increase the risk to our users. Please email us directly.
- Email Your Findings: Send your report to [Your Security Email]. Include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the issue.
- Give Us Time: We ask for your patience while we investigate your report. We will respond as quickly as possible.

## Security Update Process

Once a security issue is identified and confirmed, we will work to quickly address the issue. We will release a patch, notify our users, and update this security policy as needed.

## Out of Scope

Please note that our security policy does not include:

- Security issues in software not explicitly maintained by our project team.
- Issues that do not have a direct impact on the security of our users.

## Thank You

We appreciate your efforts in keeping our project safe and your responsible disclosure. We are committed to working with security researchers and the community to improve security.
