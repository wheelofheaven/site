The planet they\u0026rsquo;ve found was covered in water and mist, and didn\u0026rsquo;t harbour any life at the moment of its discovery. They went on to build a network of artifical satellites to study the planet. They themselves were orbiting the planet in a what we would call a space station while studying and evaluating the data they were gathering while doing so. Eventually, the data started to become clear in answering the question whether or not the planet would be able to support life and they decided to go on with their work.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Capricorn which lasted from ‚Äì21'810 to ‚Äì19'650, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. Another appellation of that period of time, that is known through the Biblical scriptures, is the First Day of Creation. The discovery and subsequent studies of that new exoplanetary world is indeed to be equated with what is being described in the first book of Genesis: \u0026ldquo;And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the planet Earth was deemed good, meaning it not only had all the elements necessary to bear new life, but was also favorable in a series of other, equally important aspects, the second phase begun. The Second Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Sagittarius.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 19'650 BC Water world # In the first book out of the three foundational works of Ra√´lism, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, Yahweh continues the exegetical interpretation of the Biblical verses.\nAnd Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. Genesis 1: 7.\nAfter studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, ‚Äúthe waters which were above the firmament‚Äù, and the ocean covering the whole planet, ‚Äúthe waters which were under the firmament‚Äù.\nAccording to Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s explanation, this excerpt describes how the scientifical pioneers went on to study cosmic rays above the clouds, and then went below the clouds but remained above the ocean. This literally means they were between the \u0026ldquo;waters above the firmament\u0026rdquo; (the clouds) and the \u0026ldquo;waters below the firmament\u0026rdquo; (the ocean).\nIll. 1 - Research vessel in cloud formations Terraforming Earth # Yahweh then goes on to explain how the first continent was built out of the shallow ocean bed.\nLet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear. Genesis 1: 9.\nAfter they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere. So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent.\nThe quoted text is a reference to the verse from Genesis 1:9, in which the Elohim create dry land by gathering the waters under heaven to one place. This describes quite literally how the scientists studied the sea bed and used explosions to raise matter from the bottom of the seas, piling it up to form a continent.\nThe process described, using explosions to raise matter from the ocean floor and create a landmass, is a form of artificial terraforming1. This is because it involves intentionally modifying the natural environment to create a new land area where there was none before. The process is similar to land reclamation2, where land is created by filling in a body of water, but in this case, the material is obtained by using explosions to bring up material from the ocean floor.\nThe key word here is terraforming. The concept of terraforming is rather a novel notion and emerged as part of the space race in the 20th century, as scientists and engineers began to explore the idea of colonizing other planets and moons in our solar system. While the idea of terraforming remains largely theoretical, it continues to capture the imagination of scientists, writers, and the public alike as a potential way to explore and colonize other worlds. In very broad terms, terraforming refers to the theoretical process of transforming a planet, moon, or other celestial body to make it habitable for humans and other Earth-based life forms. This process typically involves a combination of technologies and processes designed to change the climate, atmosphere, and other environmental conditions of a celestial body in order to make it more like Earth. Terraformation of neighbouring planets such as Mars3 or Venus4 has been envisioned by planetary scientists such as Carl Sagan since the 1960s and has been revisited very recently with the SpaceX Mars program5.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t that exactly what supposedly happened initially here on Earth? In this specific instance, the kind of terraforming applied by the Elohimian scientists would involve intentionally modifying the physical environment of a celestial body (in this case, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s ocean floor) in order to create a new land mass that could potentially support life. The process would likely involve a combination of scientific and engineering techniques, including mapping the ocean floor, analyzing geological data to identify the most suitable areas for land formation, and designing and executing controlled explosions to raise material from the ocean floor. If we imagine how this might have happened, it\u0026rsquo;s within the thinkable that a large number of controlled and coordinated explosions would be necessary to raise enough material from the ocean floor to create a continent. One possibility might have been to use strategically placed explosive charges to fracture the ocean floor in a controlled manner, allowing material to be dislodged and raised to the surface.\nSuch a process would have significant impacts on the topological constitution of the planet and would require careful consideration and planning to minimize undesired long-term or latent side effects. Also, the feasibility of such a process would depend on a number of factors, including the depth and composition of the ocean floor, the availability of suitable materials for land formation, and the technical and logistical challenges of executing such a large-scale project. This must have really been a project of gigantic proportions.\nIll. 2 - Earth-shaping through controlled explosions Pangaea # This single massive supercontinent that got raised from the bottoms of the oceans does sound a lot like the contemporary idea of a supercontinent that supposedly must have existed according to geological insights. This hypothetised supercontient is known as Pangaea6. It is thought to have existed during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, from about 335 to 175 million years ago. It is also thought to have been the most recent of several supercontinents that have formed and broken apart over the course of Earth\u0026rsquo;s history.7\nPangaea was a single, massive landmass that included all of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s major continents at the time, including North America, South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The formation of Pangaea is believed to have been driven by the movement of tectonic plates, which gradually brought the continents together over millions of years.\nIf we assume that a single massive supercontinent were to be raised from the shallow oceans in a scenario like the one described in the passage above, it could very well potentially resemble Pangaea in terms of its size and shape. If we assume that a massive terraforming effort wheere land mass was formed out of the bottom of the oceans could potentially have unintended consequences that lead to the emergence of plate tectonics, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say exactly what those consequences might be. The mechanisms that drive plate tectonics are complex and not fully understood, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to predict how they might be affected by large-scale modifications to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface.\nThat said, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the creation of a large landmass from the ocean floor could potentially alter the balance of forces within the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust and mantle, leading to increased geological activity and the emergence of plate tectonics. This could result in the formation of new land masses, volcanic activity, and other geologic processes that could reshape the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface over time. It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting to ponder the consequences of these terraforming activities.\nIll. 3 - Research installation on barren dry soil Second day of creation # As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, The Age of Sagittarius corresponds to the Biblical Second Day of Creation. The amount of time it took for the extraterrestrial scientists to keep on researching the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceanic and topographic features and to proceed with the terraformation of dry surface area by amassing matter into one spot thus shaping a new supercontinent took a while. That period of time is referred to as a day in the book of Genesis. This day however, as explained in the previous chapter, is not to be substituted with a day and night cycle of 24 hours, but a celestial day that refers to the passage of time during one precession-induced World Age.\nWhile the transition from one task to the other task may be seen as continuous, what matters is to be able to locate a given event, such as the terraformation of a supercontinent, in a frame of time that accounts for long periods of time. The Sagittarian World Age during which the events happened as stated earlier lasted therefore, as any other World Age for that matter, 2'160 years.\nThe Second Day of Creation is described in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 1:6-8. On this day, the Elohim are said to have created the firmament, or the expanse, to separate the waters below from the waters above.\n6 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.‚Äù 7 God made the expanse, and separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse; and it was so. 8 God called the expanse ‚Äúheaven.‚Äù And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. (NASB 2020 üîó)\nAs we know now, the Elohim didn\u0026rsquo;t create the waters above or below the firmament, but simply went on with their scientific investigations to understand the planet Earth better which was covered with thick mist above the planet-wide oceans.\n9 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear‚Äù; and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land ‚Äúearth,‚Äù and the gathering of the waters He called ‚Äúseas‚Äù; and God saw that it was good. (NASB 2020 üîó)\nFrom a strictly Biblical point of view, the moment where the Elohim \u0026ldquo;gather the waters below the heavens into one place and for dry land to appear\u0026rdquo; happens after the Second Day has ended. The Ra√´lian canon is not specific enough to locate the terraformation events in either the second of third World Age after their arrival. For stylistic reasons, we chose to include the terraforming happenings during the Second Day of Creation, during the Age of Sagittarius. These may have endured for a while and have well lasted into the Third Day of Creation.\nA quick recap # The Age of Sagittarius is one of the twelve World Ages and lasted from from ‚Äì19'650 to up ‚Äì17'490 and took, as each World Age, 2'160 years to complete. It is considered the second World Age out of the twelve World Ages. This second World Age corresponds to the Second Day of Creation famously mentioned in the Biblical book of Genesis. It was during the Age of Sagittarius that a non-terrestrial civilization that has arrived to Earth a while ago and started to investigate the planet for its ability to sustain life. At some point during their investigations, which showed that the planet Earth indeed predisposed to harbour life, these scientists decided to settle on its grounds. For it lacked any dry ground to land on, they single-handedly they proceeded to terraform such a continent out of the oceans\u0026rsquo; seabed.\nThe terraformation project consisted of a series of controlled subterrain ignitions. These ignitions formed cavities that would act as a type of land reclamation. Ultimately, the product of these terraforming activities gave rise to a landform that itself would lay the basis for dry ground to land and build upon. This made it possible for the extraterrestrial visitors to land and build lasting structures on the surface of the Earth.\nAfter the Age of Sagittarius (from ‚Äì19'650 to ‚Äì17'490) comes the Age of Scorpio (from ‚Äì17'490 to ‚Äì15'330). After the Capricornian First Day of Creation, the Age of Sagittarius corresponds to the Second Day of Creation, the following Age of Scorpio evidently equates to the Third Day of Creation.\nLand reclamation is the process of creating new land from the sea. The simplest method of land reclamation involves simply filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or cement, then filling with clay and soil until the desired height is reached.

The theory of plate tectonics explains how the movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s plates caused Pangaea to break apart and its continents to drift apart. The estimated age of this remote supercontinent Pangaea is a product of assuming the so-called Uniformitarianism because the theory of plate tectonics and the concept of Pangaea are fundamental to the Uniformitarian Doctrine. This doctrine assumes that the processes and natural laws that operate in the present have operated in the same way throughout the history of the Earth.

The whole planet was covered in water, so they went on to build new outposts on the surface these oceans and kept studying and surveying the constitution of this new planet, especially its ocean and the bottom of it. Eventually, they realized they could terraform a dry land mass by piling up matter from the bottom of the ocean in one place. A single gigantic land mass emerged through the terraformation.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Sagittarius which lasted from ‚Äì19'650 to ‚Äì17'490, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. As we learned with the Age of Capricorn, which represents the First Day of Creation mentioned in the first book of Genesis, the Age of Sagittarius as the subsequent World Age is therefore representing the Second Day of Creation. The Bible describes the terraformation very eloquently as wollows: ‚ÄúLet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.‚Äù\nWith the newly terraformed supercontinent, the Elohimian scientists could land on firm soil and build permanent structures; the third phase could begin. The Third Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Scorpio.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 17'490 BC Directed abiogenesis # Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth. Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe quoted text is a reference to Genesis 1:11, in which the Elohimian scientists create vegetation on Earth. These scientists create plant cells from chemicals in a laboratory setting, with the goal of producing different types of plants. The scientists\u0026rsquo; focus was on reproduction, and they worked to create cells that could eventually reproduce on their own.\nThe creation of synthetic life involves the design and engineering of biological systems that can perform specific functions or exhibit specific behaviors. In the context of the passage, the scientists are creating plant cells from chemicals in a laboratory setting, which is a type of synthetic life engineering.\nThis type of engineering involves using techniques from various fields, including genetics, molecular biology, and bioengineering, to create artificial organisms or biological systems that did not exist on the Elohimian home planet before. To create synthetic life, these scientists need a thorough understanding of the molecular and genetic processes that underpin life. This includes knowledge of DNA replication, gene expression, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. They also require access to advanced tools and techniques for manipulating DNA and other biomolecules, such as CRISPR/Cas91 gene editing. Other advanced techniques such as synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and protein engineering have also been developed to enable scientists to engineer new biological systems and molecules with specific functions.\nThe creation of synthetic life through engineering can be considered a type of directed abiogenesis, as it involves the deliberate design and creation of new forms of life using chemical and biological processes. Abiogenesis refers to the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, and directed abiogenesis involves actively guiding and controlling this process to achieve specific outcomes.\nIn synthetic life engineering, scientists are using their understanding of the principles of life to create new biological systems and organisms that do not exist in nature. This involves the design and construction of synthetic DNA and other biomolecules, as well as the development of new techniques for manipulating and controlling biological systems.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to speculate on how a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization such as the Elohim might create synthetic life ex nihilo (from nothing), as we cannot be certain what their technological capabilities and limitations might have been in that moment in time. However, we can imagine some general strategies that the Elohim might have employed based on our current understanding of synthetic biology and genome engineering.\nOne possible approach to creating synthetic life ex nihilo might involve using advanced tools for genome engineering, such as CRISPR/Cas9 or other gene editing systems as mentioned before, to manipulate the genetic code of simple organisms such as bacteria or yeast. By carefully engineering the genome of these organisms, the Elohimian scientists could potentially create entirely new biological systems with novel functions and behaviors.\nAnother approach might involve designing and synthesizing artificial DNA and other biomolecules that could be used to build entirely new biological systems from scratch. This would require a deep understanding of the underlying principles of life, as well as advanced techniques for synthesizing complex biomolecules and designing self-assembling systems.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also possible that a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization might employ computational methods to design and simulate synthetic biological systems before actually building them. Computer simulations and modeling can be used to predict the behavior of complex biological systems, and could help extraterrestrial scientists to identify optimal designs and avoid potential pitfalls.\nAs for now, we must satisfy ourselves with mere speculations as we cannot fathom what incredible knowledge and technologies these early Elohimian scientists must have wielded to synthetize new life forms.\nIll. 1 - Genetic research lab with water supplies Intelligent Design # Not only can this process be considered directed abiogenesis, but is also a subtype of Intelligent Design. Intelligent Design is a concept that argues that certain features of the natural world are best explained by the intervention of an intelligent designer or creator, rather than through natural processes such as evolution. Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that there are certain biological structures and systems that are too complex to have evolved through natural selection and therefore must have been designed by a higher power.\nIntelligent Design argues that certain features of the natural world, such as the complexity and functionality of living organisms, are best explained by the intervention of an intelligent designer or creator. Proponents of Intelligent Design often use analogies to computer programming to support their argument, such as the idea that the DNA code that governs the development of living organisms is analogous to a software program. This kind of paradigm argues that the information content of the genetic code, and the complex biological systems that it controls, cannot be explained by natural processes such as evolution, but instead require the intervention of an intelligent agent or designer.\nFor instance, the intelligent agent is often considered a type of coder as biological life is thought to feature an information layer that is considered unaccounted for by more popular explanations such as evolution. DNA is often compared to computer programs because both are systems of information storage and processing that rely on a digital code. DNA is a long, linear molecule that consists of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the genetic code. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes information that directs the development, function, and behavior of living organisms. Computer programs, similarly, are a set of instructions written in a digital language that directs the function of a computer. Computer programs consist of a series of code that is stored in binary form, consisting of 0s and 1s that represent the basic building blocks of digital information. Both DNA and computer programs rely on a digital code, where the sequence of individual units (nucleotides or binary digits) determines the overall function and behavior of the system. In the case of DNA, the sequence of nucleotides determines the sequence of amino acids that make up proteins, which in turn determine the structure and function of cells and tissues in the body.\nIntelligent Design is often associated with creationism, which is the belief that the Earth and all living things were created by a divine entity, as described in religious texts. Most Intelligent Design proponents have a Christian background and therefore equate the Designer to besame as the Creator God of the Christian exegesis of the Bible. While the process of creating synthetic life involves deliberate design and engineering, it is based on natural principles and the laws of physics and chemistry however. The goal of synthetic life engineering is to understand and replicate the natural processes that underlie life, rather than to invoke any kind of supernatural or religious explanation for the origin of life.\nIll. 2 - Geodesic research structures on grassland Game of Life # [\u0026hellip;] The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.\nThe extraterrestrial scientists created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate of the continent they were exploring. They worked in small research teams and met regularly to compare their progress. The people on their own planet followed their work with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists joined the scientists to create decorative and pleasing plants with unique appearances and fragrances.\nThey may use advanced techniques for genome engineering and biomolecule synthesis to create plants with desired traits, such as drought resistance or colorful blooms, and then modify these plants further over time to optimize their performance in the local environment. In terms of the involvement of artists in the scenario, this could suggest that aesthetics and creativity are valued as highly as functionality and practicality in the design and creation of synthetic life forms. The artists may use their skills to design plants with unique appearances and fragrances, using colors, textures, and patterns to create a visually appealing and harmonious environment. They may also work with the scientists to identify plants with particularly interesting or useful features, and then modify these plants further to enhance their aesthetic qualities. The involvement of artists in the scenario raises interesting questions about the relationship between art and science, and the potential role of aesthetics in the design and creation of synthetic life forms. It suggests that the creation of new life forms could be viewed as a form of art, with the aim of not only creating useful and functional organisms, but also aesthetically pleasing and visually stunning ones.\nAs Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s explanation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide specific details about the different climates, we can only speculate about what they might have looked like. Depending on the size of the continent and its location on the globe, the different climates could range from arid deserts to lush tropical rainforests, from icy tundras to windy steppes.\nEach of these climates would present unique challenges and opportunities for the extraterrestrial scientists in terms of the types of plants they could create and the adaptations required for those plants to survive in their respective environments. In a desert climate, for example, the plants may need to be adapted to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures, while in a rainforest climate they may need to be adapted to compete with other plant species for resources such as sunlight and water. In a polar climate, where temperatures are consistently below freezing, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate extreme cold and snow. These plants may need to be adapted to conserve energy during long periods of darkness and to withstand strong winds. In a tropical climate, where temperatures are consistently warm and rainfall is abundant, the scientists may need to create plants that can grow quickly and compete for resources such as sunlight and water. These plants may also need to be adapted to resist pests and diseases that thrive in humid conditions. In a mountainous climate, where temperatures can vary widely depending on altitude, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations and low oxygen levels at high elevations. These plants may also need to be adapted to rocky terrain and steep slopes. In a coastal climate, where saltwater spray and high winds can be common, the scientists may need to create plants that can tolerate salt and moisture. These plants may need to be adapted to sandy soils and to resist damage from high winds and storms.\nIn other words, the specific characteristics of the different climates would require the Elohimian scientists to create plants with a wide range of adaptations and traits, based on the specific challenges and opportunities presented by each environment.\nIll. 3 - Primordial jungle featuring a researcher Third day of creation # As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, The Age of Scorpio corresponds to the Biblical Third Day of Creation. The period of time during which the extraterrestrial scientists were erecting terrestrial residential buildings and scientific research installations was indeed the Scorpionian Age. As we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the previous chapter, The Age of Sagittarius, a supercontinent got formed out of the seabed by amassing matter from the bottom of the oceans in a given place, ultimately forming dry land that surpassed the sea level. It is on that newly formed dry land that these terrestrial structures were built upon, truly deserving the descriptor \u0026ldquo;terrestrial\u0026rdquo;, on the earthy soil of the planet Earth. What succeeded was the beginning of what we commonly think of when we say Genesis. Genesis as in the creation of the very life that we see all around us. This Genesis project started with the engineering of simple cells from scratch. After the cells were successfully created, more complex organisms followed, organisms such as plants. All of this happaned during the Third Day of Creation, during the Age of Scorpio, a World Age that is situated between 17'490‚Äî15'330 BC.\nThe Third Day of Creation is described in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 1:9-13. The Elohim are said to have gathered the waters under the heaven into one place, forming the dry land, which is called \u0026ldquo;Earth,\u0026rdquo; and the gathering together of the waters is called \u0026ldquo;Seas.\u0026rdquo; The Elohim then commanded the Earth to bring forth vegetation, including grass, herbs, and fruit-bearing trees.\n11 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them‚Äù; and it was so. 12 The earth produced vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, according to their kind; and God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\nWe can cleary read into what is being said here: \u0026ldquo;Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them\u0026rdquo;. The fact that reproduction is highlighted as much in the Biblical Genesis story exhibits how this feature was of capital importance to these extraterrestrial scientists when they started out creating the first artifical organisms, namely organisms that were inherently capable of reproducing themselves, needing no further intervention from outside to preserve the continuity of their existence. \u0026ldquo;And it was so.\u0026rdquo; They managed to implement this crucial feature with success, most likely taking life from their home planet as a blueprint template. The Elohim \u0026ldquo;saw that it was good\u0026rdquo;. Patience paid off, after two full World Ages lasting for more than 4'000 Earthly years culminated in the ability to finally start with the serious work that got banned on their home planet, and their perseverance bore fruits.\nA quick recap # The Age of Scorpio is linked to the Biblical Third Day of Creation. During this time, which corresponds to a period between 17,490‚Äì15,330 BC, extraterrestrial scientists are said to have built terrestrial residential buildings and scientific research installations on the newly formed dry land, as described in the Book of Genesis 1:9-13.\nThe creation of life as we know it started with the engineering of simple cells, followed by more complex organisms such as plants. The fact that reproduction is emphasized in the Biblical Genesis story suggests that this feature was crucial for these extraterrestrial scientists when creating the first artificial organisms. They aimed to create organisms capable of reproducing themselves without the need for further intervention.\nAfter the Age of Scorpio (from ‚Äì17'490 to ‚Äì15'330) comes the Age of Libra (from ‚Äì15'330 to ‚Äì13'170). As we\u0026rsquo;ve identified the Days of Creation being each a World Age based on the cycle of precession, the following Age of Libra corresponds to the Fourth Day of Creation.\nGene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 are a group of powerful tools that would allow potential scientists to precisely modify the genetic code of living organisms. These technologies work by using specialized proteins to cut and modify specific sections of DNA, allowing researchers to add, delete, or replace genes with great accuracy.

As soon as they managed to terraform a new barren continental land mass out of the bottom of the oceans, they went on to synthetize plant life. This plant life was engineered from nothing else but chemical base elements. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take them long to cover the new supercontinent with grass, saplings, shrubs and other greeneries. The engineers were joined by artists and formed various research groups that each focused on a different region of this supercontinent to diversify and sophisticate further the newly created flora.\nAll of that happened during the Age of Scorpio which lasted from ‚Äì17'490 to ‚Äì15'330, one of the twelve precessional World Ages. As we learned with the preceedings World Ages, which each represented one of the Days of Creation as mentioned in the first book of Genesis, the Age of Libra as the subsequent World Age is considered the Fourth Day of Creation.\nWith the research groups having split up and while exploring the prospective creative possibilities of having a whole planet to themselves, the Elohimian scientists had all the freedom in their hands to fully take advantage of their situation. Earth was a sandbox environment of engineering, research and artistic expression. It was time to settle further and better understand the environment they were in; the fourth phase could begin. The Fourth Day of Creation is the sum of all events that happened subsequently during the Age of Libra.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 15'330 BC Regulation # Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. Genesis 1: 14.\nBy observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.\nYahweh states here that lights in the sky, such as stars and the sun, serve to differentiate day and night, and to mark signs, seasons, days, and years. Observing these celestial bodies allowed the Elohimian pioneers to measure time on Earth and adapt to the differing duration of days and years compared to their original planet. Studying astronomy helped them better understand and navigate their new environment on Earth.\nWe know that the Elohim, the Celestials that came from the sky, originate from a different planet. We\u0026rsquo;re only so far in narrating the overarching story, not a lot is known yet about the Elohimian home planet. In the excerpt above, we learned that the duration of the day and night cycle as well as the duration of the year is different on their home planet than here on Earth. For reasons that we won\u0026rsquo;t go into here, let\u0026rsquo;s be said that there are reasons to believe that they day and night cycle would be much longer on the Elohimian home planet.\nIf we speculate on what would have been seen as different in direct comparaison of their home planet and the new Earthly frontier world they were exploring at that moment in time, several differences in the night sky and the pace of various astronomical cycles could have been observed. The arrangement of stars visible from their planet would likely be different, resulting in unique constellations and celestial landmarks compared to those on Earth. Their planet might have a different number of moons or other visible celestial bodies, which could influence tides, illumination during the night, and other phenomena.\nThe rotation period of their planet might be different from Earth\u0026rsquo;s, leading to longer or shorter days and nights. Their planet\u0026rsquo;s orbit around its star might also be shorter or longer than Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, affecting the duration of a year and the pace of seasonal changes. If their planet has a different axial tilt compared to Earth, the intensity and duration of seasons could differ as well.\nThe Elohimian planet could orbit a star different from our Sun, such as a red dwarf or a binary star system. This would affect the amount and type of light received on the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface, as well as the pace of various astronomical cycles. Additionally, a different magnetic field strength could lead to unique auroras, different levels of cosmic radiation, and other effects on their planet\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere.\nThese differences would affect the way the Elohimian scientists perceive and measure time, as well as their understanding of astronomy and celestial events. Adapting to Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique cycles and celestial phenomena would be crucial for their successful integration and navigation on our planet.\nIll. 1 - Geodetic installation by the ocean Adaptation # The new Earthly planet could offer a range of different possibilities. We learned in the previous chapter how new plant life was created ex-nihilo from base elements, the Elohimian scientists would face a unique opportunity to design and shape the planet\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems from scratch. This would allow them to build a completely new biosphere, with a careful balance of plants, fungi and other small life forms such as insects and worms, that could thrive in Earth\u0026rsquo;s specific environmental conditions.\nCreating Earth-specific plant life ex-nihilo would involve designing plants that could efficiently harness energy from the Sun through photosynthesis, and have the necessary adaptations to survive and reproduce in different climates and habitats. These engineered plants would form the basis of Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems, providing the essential foundation for food chains and nutrient cycles.\nOnce the flora would be established, the scientists would be able to introduce various fauna, designed to interact with the plants and with one another in a harmonious manner. This would involve the possibility of creating herbivores to consume the plants, carnivores to regulate herbivore populations, and decomposers to recycle nutrients back into the environment. The balance of these species would be crucial in maintaining a stable and functioning ecosystem.\nThe Elohimian scientists would also have the opportunity to design Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystems in such a way that they are resilient to disturbances and can adapt to changing conditions over time. This could involve creating species with high genetic diversity, fostering symbiotic relationships between different organisms, and ensuring that ecosystems have redundancies and backups for key ecological processes.\nThe synthetic engineering of plant life on a new Earthly planet could significantly benefit from the knowledge gained through observing the sky and understanding one\u0026rsquo;s location. This knowledge would provide valuable information about the specific environmental conditions that the engineered plants would need to adapt to, and help guide the design of these plants to ensure their success in the new ecosystem.\nUnderstanding day-night cycles through sky observation would enable the scientists to design plants that can efficiently utilize available sunlight for photosynthesis. They could tailor the plants\u0026rsquo; light-harvesting mechanisms and growth patterns to match the duration and intensity of sunlight received in different parts of the planet.\nBy studying the movements of celestial bodies, scientists could also gain insight into Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and seasonal variations. This knowledge would be crucial in engineering plants that can tolerate temperature fluctuations and adapt to the changing availability of water and nutrients throughout the year. Additionally, understanding how seasonal changes impact pollinator activity could help inform the development of plants with appropriate flowering and fruiting periods to maximize reproductive success.\nPrecise location information, derived from astronomical observations, would allow scientists to map out the different biomes and habitats present on Earth. This knowledge would enable them to engineer plant species that are specifically adapted to the unique environmental conditions of each biome, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil composition.\nMonitoring the sky could also help scientists predict and prepare for natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or meteor impacts, which could significantly affect the survival of the engineered plant life. By understanding the potential risks and incorporating resilience strategies into the design of the plants, they could increase the likelihood of their successful establishment and long-term survival on the new Earthly planet.\nIll. 2 - Primordial botany featuring two researchers Earth in motion # Several key astronomical cycles, which are influenced by Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique properties, govern various aspects of our planet\u0026rsquo;s behavior and environment.\nOne of the most fundamental cycles is the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation, which creates the day-night cycle. As Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the planet are exposed to sunlight, resulting in alternating periods of daylight and darkness. This cycle has a significant impact on temperature, weather patterns, and the behavior of living organisms.\nAnother important astronomical cycle is Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, which takes approximately 365.25 days to complete. This cycle, combined with Earth\u0026rsquo;s axial tilt of roughly 23.5 degrees, results in the changing of the seasons. As Earth moves around the Sun, the angle at which sunlight strikes different parts of the planet changes, leading to variations in temperature, daylight duration, and weather conditions.\nThe axial tilt of Earth also leads to the cycle of solstices and equinoxes. The solstices mark the longest and shortest days of the year, while the equinoxes occur when day and night have equal lengths. These events are caused by Earth\u0026rsquo;s tilted axis and its position relative to the Sun during its orbit.\nIn addition to these cycles, the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit around Earth gives rise to several cycles that influence our planet. The most notable of these is the lunar cycle, which lasts approximately 29.5 days. This cycle causes the Moon to go through different phases, from new moon to full moon, as its position relative to Earth and the Sun changes. The lunar cycle has a strong influence on tides, with higher tides occurring during full and new moons due to the combined gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun.\nAnother lunar cycle is the lunar nodal cycle, which lasts about 18.6 years. This cycle affects the angle of the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit relative to Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator, influencing the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses. When the nodes of the Moon\u0026rsquo;s orbit align with the Sun, eclipses can occur.\nThese astronomical cycles are crucial in shaping the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate, ecosystems, and the behavior of living organisms. Understanding these cycles allows us to predict and prepare for various natural events, as well as to better comprehend the complex interactions that occur on our planet.\nSeveral key astronomical cycles, which are influenced by Earth\u0026rsquo;s unique properties, govern various aspects of our planet\u0026rsquo;s behavior and environment.\nOne of the most fundamental cycles is the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation, which creates the day-night cycle.

Precession has been explained multiple times during the Introduction because it plays a key role in retelling of the Elohimian chronicles with an accurate time marker. Precession, often referred to as the precession of the equinoxes, is the gradual change in the orientation of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. It is caused by the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge. This slow, wobbling motion of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis takes approximately 25'920 years (modern day estimations amount to 25'772 years) to complete a full cycle.\nAs a result of precession, the position of the celestial poles (the points in the sky that the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis points towards) gradually shifts over time. This means that the pole stars, which are currently Polaris in the Northern Hemisphere and Sigma Octantis in the Southern Hemisphere, change over thousands of years. For example, around the year 14'000 CE, the bright star Vega will become the new North Star.\nPrecession also impacts the timing of the solstices and equinoxes. Over the course of the 25'920-year cycle, the positions of the Sun along the ecliptic at the time of the solstices and equinoxes gradually shift. This has a subtle effect on the length of the seasons and the timing of the solstices and equinoxes, with each season slowly changing its duration.\nUnderstanding Earth\u0026rsquo;s various cycles such as the precession allowed the Elohimian scientists to study long-term astronomical changes, which can have implications for climate and ecosystems.\nFourth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"13","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –î–µ–≤—ã","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –î–µ–≤—ã, –¥–ª–∏–≤—à–∞—è—Å—è —Å 13 170 –ø–æ 11 010 –≥–æ–¥ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç., –æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–∞ –ù–µ–±–µ—Å\", —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –í–µ—Å–æ–≤. –í —ç—Ç—É —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å —Å–º–µ—â–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ –ø—Ç–∏—Ü. –ü—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—Å—è —Å —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∫—Ç–æ–Ω–∞, –º–µ–ª–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä—ã–±, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–π –¥–ª—è —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã. –≠—Ç–æ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞–µ—Ç —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø—ã. –ö—Ä–æ–º–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –≤ —ç—Ç—É —ç—Ä—É –±—ã–ª–∏ –≤–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω—ã –ø—Ç–∏—Ü—ã, –ø—Ä–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–º —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤—É—é —Ä–æ–ª—å –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∏—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º –∏ —è—Ä–∫–∏—Ö —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ã–º–∏, —á—Ç–æ –≤–ª–∏—è–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ç–∏—Ü –∫ –ø–æ–ª–µ—Ç—É. –ó–∞–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–ª —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏—Ö, –ø—É–≥–∞—é—â–∏—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤, –Ω–∞–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –¥—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–≤, –¥–∏–Ω–æ–∑–∞–≤—Ä–æ–≤ –∏ –±—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–∑–∞–≤—Ä–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞—è —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—é—é –æ–ø–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏—é –∫ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –∞–º–±–∏—Ü–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–º –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∞–º —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ —É—á–µ–Ω—ã—Ö.","content":"The Age of Virgo lasts from ‚Äì13'170 to ‚Äì11'010 and follows the Age of Libra which lasted up to ‚Äì13'170.\nFig. 2 - Vernal equinox in 13'170 BC Aquatic and bird kingdoms # Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens. Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn. Thus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as ‚Äúecology‚Äù, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals. [\u0026hellip;]\nIll. 1 - Oceanium laboratory installation under water In Genesis 1:20, the waters are filled with an abundance of living creatures, and birds are created to fly above the Earth. The first aquatic animals were created, starting from plankton and small fish to larger fish, along with seaweed to maintain balance in the ecosystem. This allowed smaller fish to feed on seaweed while bigger fish could eat the smaller fish, ensuring that one species wouldn\u0026rsquo;t destroy another for survival. This process is similar to modern-day \u0026ldquo;ecology.\u0026rdquo; The scientists and artists involved in these creations often held competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or interesting animals.\nIll. 2 - Fauna and flora Artistic expression # [\u0026hellip;] After the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome. The contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe creation of birds followed the creation of fish, with artists heavily involved in designing their diverse forms and vibrant colors. The focus on aesthetics led to some birds having difficulty flying due to their cumbersome feathers. Competitions expanded to include not only physical attributes but also the animals\u0026rsquo; behavior, especially the intricate mating dances they performed.\nCreating birds with a strong focus on aesthetics and unique behaviors, such as elaborate mating rituals, would involve genetic engineering to manipulate specific genes responsible for physical traits and behavioral patterns. Scientists would need to identify and modify genes that control feather development, coloration, and patterns to create visually stunning birds. Similarly, they would need to understand and alter the genetic basis for the behaviors associated with mating rituals, such as courtship displays and dances.\nIll. 3 - Palatial bird with lots of decorative features Jurassic origins # [\u0026hellip;] Some other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nIn the creation process, certain groups of scientists designed fearsome creatures resembling monsters, such as dragons or what we know as dinosaurs and brontosaurs. These creations validated the concerns of those who had initially opposed the creation plans on the scientists\u0026rsquo; home planet.\nIn this context, dinosaurs, a diverse group of reptiles, would represent an earlier stage of synthetic life experimentation on Earth, with their unique physical features and behaviors potentially serving as a showcase of the scientists\u0026rsquo; capabilities in designing life forms. They were unique in their upright posture, with legs positioned directly beneath their bodies, unlike other reptiles that have sprawling limbs. This allowed dinosaurs to be more energy-efficient and agile, giving them an advantage in their environment.\nThe size of dinosaurs varied greatly, from small chicken-sized creatures to gigantic sauropods that reached lengths of over 30 meters. They were terrestrial animals and inhabited a range of ecosystems, from forests and plains to coastal regions and deserts. Dinosaurs can be broadly classified into two major groups: the Saurischia, which includes the theropods (carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex) and the sauropods (large, long-necked herbivores like the Brachiosaurus), and the Ornithischia, which includes the herbivorous, bird-hipped dinosaurs such as the Triceratops and Stegosaurus.\nSome dinosaurs exhibited remarkable adaptations, such as sharp teeth and claws for hunting or long necks for reaching vegetation in high places. They also featured various defense mechanisms, like bony plates, spikes, and frills, to protect themselves from predators. The reproductive strategy of dinosaurs involved laying eggs, and many species built nests to protect and incubate their offspring. Their legacy lives on through the birds, which are considered to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs and have evolved from small, feathered theropod dinosaurs.\nIll. 4 - Pod of brontosaurs grazing on meadowland Fifth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"14","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B2%D0%B0/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –õ—å–≤–∞","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –õ—å–≤–∞, –¥–ª–∏–≤—à–∞—è—Å—è —Å 11 010 –ø–æ 8 850 –≥–æ–¥ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç., —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –î–µ–≤—ã –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–∞ –ù–µ–±–µ—Å\". –≠—Ç–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–µ–Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –Ω–∞–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ –ø—Ç–∏—Ü. –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞, —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é, –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏–ª–∞ –æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å—ã –¥–ª—è —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–æ—è–¥–Ω—ã—Ö, –∞ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –≤–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω—ã —Ö–∏—â–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≤–µ—Å–∏—è. –ó–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ–º –≤ —ç—Ç—É —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É —Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤, –ø–æ—Ö–æ–∂–∏—Ö –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–∏—Ö –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —É—á–µ–Ω—ã—Ö. –≠—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª–æ –∫ —Å–ø–æ—Ä–∞–º –Ω–∞ –∏—Ö —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –∏–∑-–∑–∞ –æ–ø–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∏–π, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–∏ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–≤–∑–æ–π—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤ –ø–æ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º. –í —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ, –≤–Ω–æ–≤—å —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–±—ã—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö, –±–µ–∑ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π, –∏, –∫–∞–∫ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—è—Ç, –∫–∞–∂–¥–∞—è —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å–∞ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–µ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π.","content":"The Age of Leo lasts from ‚Äì11'010 to ‚Äì8'850 and follows the Age of Virgo which lasted up to ‚Äì11'010.\nFig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 11010 BC Animal kingdom # Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind. Genesis 1: 24.\nAfter marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.\nIn the quoted passage from the Ra√´lian book \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells the Truth,\u0026rdquo; it is explained that scientists from another planet, including the speaker (Yahweh), created various forms of life on Earth. After developing marine organisms and birds, they focused on land animals. Initially, they created herbivores, supported by the already flourishing vegetation. To maintain ecological balance, carnivores were later introduced. The ultimate goal of these extraterrestrial scientists was to establish a harmonious ecological order on Earth.\nEngineering a balanced ecological order is a complex process that involves understanding and manipulating various factors and components of an ecosystem. To create such an order, one must first study existing ecosystems, gaining insight into their structure, function, and the relationships between various living organisms and their environment. A key aspect of this process is identifying keystone species, which play a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of an ecosystem. By introducing these species into an engineered ecosystem, it is possible to establish the foundation for a balanced ecological order.\nDesigning a stable food web and considering trophic interactions are also important factors in engineering an ecological order. This involves ensuring the presence of primary producers, such as plants, which form the base of the food web, as well as herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers. It is crucial to maintain the right balance of these species to prevent overpopulation or depletion of resources. Another aspect of creating a balanced ecological order is managing population dynamics. This includes monitoring and controlling the growth and decline of different species to maintain equilibrium in the ecosystem. This may involve using natural predators, introducing new species, or implementing population control measures.\nHabitat creation and restoration are also essential in engineering an ecological order. Providing suitable living conditions and resources for various species is vital for their survival and well-being. This includes creating and preserving diverse habitats, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and aquatic environments. Ongoing monitoring and adaptive management are necessary for maintaining a balanced ecological order. By regularly assessing the health and stability of the engineered ecosystem, adjustments can be made to address any imbalances or issues that arise. This could include reintroducing species, removing invasive species, or altering habitat conditions to better support the ecosystem\u0026rsquo;s overall health.\nIll. 2 - Struggle between a lion and a crocodile The Elohim scientists, with their advanced scientific knowledge and expertise in genetic engineering, would have likely approached the creation of a balanced ecological order by first studying the biology and characteristics of various organisms. They may have started by creating simpler life forms, such as single-celled organisms, and observed their interactions and impact on the environment. As they gained more understanding of these life forms, they might have introduced more complex organisms, such as plants and simple animals, while monitoring their interactions with one another and the environment. This would have allowed them to better understand the ecological dynamics and the requirements for creating a stable ecosystem.\nWith this knowledge, they could have gradually introduced more advanced and specialized species, including herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, while ensuring that these species played specific roles in the ecosystem. They would have focused on establishing functional relationships between these species to maintain a balanced food web, ensuring that the energy and nutrients flowed throughout the system efficiently. To create the wide variety of animal species we see today, the Elohim scientists might have used their expertise in genetic engineering to adapt existing species to various habitats and conditions. This would have led to the development of species with unique adaptations suited for different environments, such as desert-dwelling animals, aquatic species, and high-altitude creatures.\nThroughout the process, they would have paid close attention to population dynamics, ensuring that the population sizes of various species remained within sustainable limits. They may have achieved this by introducing natural predators or through other means of population control. The Elohim scientists would have been involved in ongoing monitoring and adaptive management, adjusting their approach as needed to maintain a balanced ecological order. This could have included reintroducing species, removing invasive species, or modifying habitat conditions to support the overall health of the ecosystem.\nIll. 1 - Elephant walking the Earth Homo genesis # It was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making ‚Äútest tube children‚Äù who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.\nIn this passage from the book, Yahweh describes how the most skilled scientists among them wanted to create artificial human beings resembling themselves. Different teams worked on the project, and soon they were able to compare their creations. However, people on their home planet were alarmed by the idea of \u0026ldquo;test tube children,\u0026rdquo; fearing that these new humans could become a threat if they possessed superior mental capacities or powers. Consequently, the scientists agreed to let the new humans live primitively without any scientific knowledge and concealed their true intentions. Each race on Earth is said to correspond to a team of creators, seven in total.\nWhile we can only speculate about the reasons for the Elohim civilization\u0026rsquo;s outrage, some possible factors might include the fear of losing control. The Elohim civilization may have been concerned that the creation of artificial human beings with superior mental capacities or powers could lead to a potential loss of dominance over these new beings, undermining their authority. Another concern could have been the potential risks associated with creating new life forms. The Elohim civilization might have worried about the unintended consequences of their actions, such as the possibility of the new humans disrupting the natural balance of ecosystems or causing other unforeseen problems.\nAdditionally, ethical considerations could have played a role in the outrage. The creation of artificial human beings might have been viewed as playing with life, which could be seen as morally questionable or as infringing on the sanctity of life. This could have led to debates and disagreements within the Elohim civilization over the ethical implications of their actions. Also, the Elohim civilization could have feared the potential cultural, social, or political impact of introducing these new human beings. The presence of beings with superior mental capacities or powers could have led to clashes between the new humans and the Elohim civilization, or even the potential for conflict between different factions within the Elohim society.\nThe outrage and concerns from the Elohim civilization about creating artificial human beings likely led to intense discussions and debates within their society. To address these concerns and alleviate fears, the Elohim scientists might have reached a compromise that allowed them to continue their experiment but with certain limitations imposed on the new humans. By letting the new humans live primitively without any scientific knowledge, the Elohim civilization could have effectively limited their potential to develop advanced technologies and pose a threat to their creators. This approach would have also mitigated concerns about the new humans surpassing their creators in terms of mental capacities or powers.\nFurthermore, keeping the new humans in a primitive state would have enabled the Elohim civilization to maintain control over them and monitor their development more effectively. This would have provided a sense of security for the Elohim, knowing that they could intervene or make adjustments if any issues arose. Concealing their true intentions from the new humans would have helped the Elohim maintain an air of mystique and authority, potentially making it easier for them to guide and influence the development of these beings without revealing the full extent of their involvement.\nLet Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. Genesis 1: 26.\n‚ÄúIn our image!‚Äù You can see that the resemblance is striking. That is when the trouble started for us.\nIn this passage from the book, Yahweh quotes Genesis 1:26, which states the intention to create humans in their image and likeness, giving them dominion over other living creatures on Earth. Yahweh highlights the striking resemblance between humans and their creators. The passage also suggests that this point in the story marked the beginning of troubles for the Elohim scientists.\nWhen the passage states that human beings on Earth were made in the image of the Elohim and were look-alikes, it implies that humans were created to physically resemble their creators, sharing similar physical traits and characteristics. This might include aspects like body shape, facial features, and other physical attributes, suggesting that the Elohim and humans have a common appearance. Additionally, being created in the image of the Elohim could also mean that humans were designed to possess certain cognitive and emotional attributes similar to those of their creators. This might encompass aspects like intelligence, self-awareness, creativity, and the capacity for emotions, making humans distinct from other living creatures on Earth.\nThe concept of humans being made in the image of the Elohim could also carry a deeper philosophical or spiritual meaning, possibly suggesting that humans share a unique bond or connection with their creators. This might imply that humans have the potential to understand and appreciate the values, knowledge, or wisdom of the Elohim.\nIll. 3 - Humanoid in a cultivation pod Garden of Eden # The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all. Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call ‚Äúparadise on Earth‚Äù. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.\nIn this passage, Yahweh explains that the team of creators situated in what is now known as Israel, close to Greece and Turkey at the time, were perhaps the most talented of all. They created beautiful animals, fragrant plants, and the most intelligent humans in a paradise-like environment on Earth. However, to prevent these humans from surpassing their creators, it was necessary to keep them unaware of major scientific secrets while still educating them to gauge their intelligence.\nUnderstanding the paradise-like environment in the passage as the Biblical Garden of Eden, we can explore the similarities and connections between the two. The Garden of Eden, as described in the Bible, was a perfect and idyllic place, abundant with beautiful plants, animals, and resources. Similarly, the environment mentioned in the passage is referred to as \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth,\u0026rdquo; with the most beautiful animals and sweetest perfumes from the plants. This comparison suggests that the paradise created by the Elohim in the passage could be interpreted as the Garden of Eden.\nIts location in the area now known as Israel, not far from modern-day Turkey and Greece, would place it in the western part of the original supercontinent which is an interesting detail to take notice of. If we consider the general locations of Israel, Turkey, and Greece on today\u0026rsquo;s map and translate that to a single continent scenario, the Garden of Eden would likely be situated near the coast of this supercontinent, with access to the sea. This coastal location would provide a favorable environment for a lush and fertile paradise, with an abundance of natural resources, contributing to the idyllic setting described in the story.\nIll. 4 - Glowing dome structures in a lush landscape Good and Evil # Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die. Genesis 2: 16-17.\nThis means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.\nIn this passage, Yahweh quotes Genesis 2:16-17, where humans are allowed to eat from every tree in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, as eating from it would result in death. The passage then interprets this biblical warning as a metaphor, essentially saying that humans, as the created beings, can learn and read any available books, but they must not delve into scientific knowledge, or they will face severe consequences.\nExploring the idea that the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil represents access to scientific knowledge records or other types of knowledge storage allows us to reinterpret the biblical story from a different perspective.\nIn this interpretation, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil serves as a metaphor for the forbidden knowledge that the creators, or Elohim, want to keep hidden from humans. By restricting access to this knowledge, the creators aim to maintain control over humans and prevent them from reaching their full potential or surpassing their creators in terms of intellectual and technological advancements.\nThe warning about the consequences of eating from the tree could be understood as a cautionary measure to keep humans from venturing into the realms of science and technology that the creators deemed dangerous or threatening. The idea that humans would \u0026ldquo;surely die\u0026rdquo; if they consumed the fruit from the tree may symbolize the potential catastrophic consequences of humans gaining access to advanced scientific knowledge, which could lead to misuse, destruction, or imbalance within their world.\nThis perspective adds an intriguing layer to the story of the Garden of Eden, suggesting that the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is not just a moral or philosophical concept but a representation of the powerful and potentially dangerous nature of scientific knowledge. In this context, the story emphasizes the importance of responsible use of knowledge and the potential risks associated with unrestricted access to advanced information, as well as the desire of the creators to maintain control and balance within their creation.\nHypothesizing how an advanced civilization like the Elohim would preserve knowledge is an interesting aspect that may intrigue many of you. We can consider several possibilities that go beyond traditional methods, incorporating futuristic and cutting-edge technologies.\nThe Elohim may use advanced digital storage systems, possibly utilizing quantum computing, to store vast amounts of information. These storage systems would be highly efficient, compact, and capable of handling complex data structures, ensuring the preservation of their knowledge for extended periods. Another possibility is that the Elohim have developed advanced artificial intelligence systems that can store and process information. These AI systems could act as dynamic libraries, continuously updating and organizing the knowledge, making it easily accessible for the Elohim.\nThe Elohim might also harness biotechnology for preserving knowledge by encoding information into the DNA of living organisms or creating synthetic life forms specifically designed to store data. This method would allow them to access the stored knowledge by decoding the DNA sequences when needed. The Elohim could have developed advanced materials and technologies to store information at the atomic or molecular level, creating highly durable and long-lasting storage mediums. This approach would offer a high level of information density, ensuring the preservation of vast quantities of knowledge over extended periods.\nIll. 5 - Interior of a dome structure featuring round shaped and greenery Origins of science # He brought them to the man to see what he would name them. Genesis 2: 19.\nHuman beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them. Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 2:19, which describes how the first humans were given the responsibility to name the plants and animals around them. The passage explains that the creators, or Elohim, taught humans about the plants and animals in their environment, including their names and properties. This knowledge of botany and zoology was not considered dangerous for humans, so they were allowed to learn about these subjects. The passage also conveys the joy and excitement of the Elohim scientists as they observed the first human male and female eagerly learning from them.\nBotany and zoology are branches of biology that focus on the study of plant and animal life, respectively. These fields provide essential knowledge about the organisms that share the planet with humans, their life cycles, habitats, and interactions with their environment. The understanding of these subjects allows humans to better manage resources, protect ecosystems, and maintain a balanced relationship with nature.\nFrom the perspective of the Elohim, it is likely that botany and zoology were deemed safe for humans because these fields generally do not provide direct access to advanced technologies or dangerous scientific knowledge that could be misused or threaten the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s control over their creation. While botany and zoology offer valuable information about the living world, they do not inherently empower humans with the means to develop advanced technologies, manipulate genetic material, or create artificial life forms. By allowing humans to learn about botany and zoology, the Elohim would be fostering a sense of responsibility and appreciation for the natural world, which could help maintain a harmonious relationship between humans and their environment. This would be beneficial for both humans and the Elohim, as it would promote the sustainability and well-being of the planet.\nAs the creators shared knowledge about the plants and animals in their environment, including their names and properties, humans began to learn about the living world around them. This early education in botany and zoology would have laid the foundation for their understanding of biology, ecology, and other related scientific fields. So, within this context, botany and zoology can be considered the first terrestrial human sciences acquired by the first humans.\nIll. 6 - Transluscent platform above the clouds Sixth day of creation # A quick recap # "},{"id":"15","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –†–∞–∫–∞","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –†–∞–∫–∞, –æ—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Å 8850 –ø–æ 6690 –≥–æ–¥ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç., —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –õ—å–≤–∞ –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"Wheel of Heaven\". –≠—Ç–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –∏–º–µ–µ—Ç —Ä–µ—à–∞—é—â–µ–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏ –∏ –∏—Ö –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏, –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏. –ö–ª—é—á–µ–≤—ã–µ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—é—Ç —É—á–µ–Ω—ã—Ö –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞–∫ \"–ó–º–µ–π\", –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–∏–ª–∏ –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–≤ –ª—é–¥—è–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤—ã–µ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç –∞–∫—Ç –±—É–Ω—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª –∫ –∏—Ö —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–µ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª—é –∏ –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞–ª –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏ –∏ –∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏, –ø–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É –ª—é–¥–∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∏ —Å–∞–º–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏, –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç–æ–º –∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –ª—é–¥–µ–π –∫ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∏.","content":" Fig. 1 - Vernal equinox in 8850 BC The Age of Cancer lasts from ‚Äì8'850 to ‚Äì6'690 and follows the Age of Leo which lasted up to ‚Äì8'850.\nAwakening # The serpent\u0026hellip; said unto the woman\u0026hellip; of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden\u0026hellip; ye shall not surely die, for Elohim doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be like Elohim. Genesis 3: 1-5.\nSome scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù, and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 3:1-5, where in the Biblical story the serpent tempts the woman to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The passage then suggests that some scientists within the Elohim team felt a deep love for the humans they created and wanted to provide them with a complete education, including advanced scientific knowledge. These scientists, known collectively as the Serpent, encouraged the young humans, who were almost adults, to pursue their scientific studies, promising that by doing so, they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.\nIt appears that some scientists within the Elohim team developed a strong emotional bond with their human creations. This emotional connection may have led them to believe that the humans deserved to have access to the same knowledge as their creators, including advanced scientific understanding. As a result, these scientists challenged the restrictions imposed by their own civilization on the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans.\nBy encouraging the young humans to pursue scientific studies, these scientists were essentially advocating for their creations to achieve their full intellectual potential and become as knowledgeable as the Elohim themselves. This act of defiance against the established norms could be seen as a gesture of love, empathy, or solidarity with the human beings they had created.\nHowever, this act could also be seen as controversial or dangerous within the context of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s original intentions for humans, as providing access to advanced scientific knowledge could potentially lead to unforeseen consequences or challenges to the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s authority and control over their creation.\nAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. Genesis 3: 7.\nThe new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their ‚Äúparents‚Äù for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 3:7, where the eyes of the first humans were opened, and they realized they were naked. The passage then suggests that this realization also made them aware of their potential to become creators themselves, which made them angry at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them away from scientific books.\nThe new human beings appear to have developed a sense of intellectual curiosity and a desire to gain knowledge and become creators themselves. This newfound awareness of their own potential may have led them to question the restrictions imposed on their access to scientific knowledge and to feel angry or resentful towards their creators for keeping them ignorant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible that this anger was also fueled by a sense of betrayal, as the humans may have felt that their creators were withholding important information that could have helped them understand their world and their place in it. This realization could have led to a fundamental shift in the relationship between humans and their creators, as the former began to question the latter\u0026rsquo;s authority and to assert their own intellectual autonomy.\nThe humans\u0026rsquo; anger at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them away from scientific books suggests that they viewed this restriction as a form of oppression or control. This interpretation is reinforced by the comparison to \u0026ldquo;dangerous laboratory animals,\u0026rdquo; which implies that the Elohim were treating the humans as mere subjects of experimentation, rather than as equals or partners in the creation process. This sense of frustration and resentment could have motivated the humans to seek out knowledge and power on their own, potentially leading to a rebellion or a shift in the power dynamics between humans and the Elohim. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that this rebellion could have taken the form of a quest for scientific knowledge or technological advancement, as the humans sought to catch up with or surpass their creators.\nAlternatively, the humans\u0026rsquo; anger could have turned inward, as they began to question their own place in the world and their purpose as creations. This could have led to a sense of alienation or despair, as the humans struggled to reconcile their newfound awareness with their previously limited understanding of their own existence. The realization of their own potential as creators could have had far-reaching consequences for the humans and their relationship with the Elohim, potentially setting the stage for a complex and fraught dynamic between these two groups.\nIll. 1 - Modern looking urban landscape in front of large pond The Serpent # And Yahweh1 Elohim said unto the serpent, ‚ÄòBecause thou hast done this, thou art cursed\u0026hellip; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.‚Äô Genesis 3: 14.\nThe ‚Äúserpent‚Äù was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.\nIn this passage, Yahweh refers to Genesis 3:14, where the serpent is cursed for tempting the humans to eat from the tree of knowledge. The passage then suggests that the serpent refers to a small group of creators who wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth. It appears that this group of creators challenged the established norms of their own civilization by advocating for the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans. This act of defiance may have been seen as a threat to the government\u0026rsquo;s control over its population and to the established order of their society.\nAs a result, the creators were punished by being sent into exile on Earth, while the other scientists were forced to abandon their experiments and leave the planet. This punishment suggests that the government of the Elohim was willing to use harsh measures to maintain control over its population and to prevent the dissemination of dangerous knowledge. This passage therefore suggests that the conflict between the creators who wished to share knowledge with humans and the government that sought to maintain control over its population had significant consequences, leading to the exile of the creators and a shift in the relationship between humans and their creators.\nThe fact that the Elohimian scientists were banished by their remote home planet government is presented as a crucial consequence of the narrative. The creators who wished to share knowledge with humans represent a progressive or revolutionary element within the Elohimian society, challenging the established order and advocating for greater freedom and equality. The government of the Elohim, on the other hand, represents a conservative or authoritarian element, seeking to maintain control and preserve the existing power structure. The conflict between these two groups could be seen as a reflection of the tensions that can arise between progressive and conservative elements within any society.\nUnto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them. Genesis 3: 21.\nThe creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, enough to manage without needing any further contact with them. The Bible has preserved a sentence, which is close to the original document:\nBehold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil2: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. Genesis 3: 22.\nHuman life is very short, but there is a scientific way to prolong it. Human scientists who study all their lives can only begin to amass sufficient knowledge to start making interesting discoveries when they get old, which is the reason why human progress is so slow. If humans could live ten times longer, scientific knowledge would take a gigantic leap forward.\nThis passage describes how the creators of humanity provided Adam and Eve with clothing made from animal skins, giving them the basic means of survival necessary to manage without further contact. The passage also suggests that humans have the potential to gain knowledge of good and evil, similar to their creators. This implies that humans have the capacity for growth and development, potentially reaching the same level of knowledge as their creators.\nAccording to the passage, the scientific way to prolong human life would enable humans to make significant strides in knowledge and discovery, potentially leading to a \u0026ldquo;gigantic leap forward.\u0026rdquo; If humans could live ten times longer, for example, they would have much more time to study and accumulate knowledge, allowing them to make discoveries that may currently be out of reach due to the limitations of the human lifespan. They would also have more time to gain practical experience and apply their knowledge to real-world problems, potentially leading to more rapid progress and innovation. Furthermore, a longer lifespan would allow for greater collaboration and knowledge-sharing among generations, as older scientists and thinkers would have more time to pass on their knowledge and mentor younger generations. This could lead to a more cumulative and expansive body of knowledge, potentially unlocking new insights and discoveries.\nIf when they were first created these new beings could have lived much longer, they would have quite rapidly become our equals because their mental faculties are slightly superior to our own. They are unaware of their full potential. This applies especially to the people of Israel who, as I mentioned earlier, had been selected in a contest as the most successful type of humanoid on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. This explains why they have always considered themselves to be the ‚Äúchosen people‚Äù. In truth they were the people chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. You can see for yourself the number of geniuses born out of that race.\nHere, Yahweh explains that if humans had a longer lifespan, they would be able to rapidly develop their mental faculties and potentially become equals to their creators, as they possess slightly superior mental capabilities. He also mentions that the people of Israel were selected as the most successful humanoid type on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. The idea is presented that the people of Israel were chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. The passage suggests that the people of Israel have historically considered themselves to be the \u0026ldquo;chosen people\u0026rdquo; due to their intelligence and superior mental faculties. This idea is supported by the numerous geniuses that have emerged from the Jewish community throughout history.\nThe idea that the people of Israel were selected as the most successful humanoid type due to their superior intelligence can be understood as a way to explain why this particular group of people has historically played such a prominent role in human history. According to this perspective, the Jewish people\u0026rsquo;s intellectual abilities and creativity have made them uniquely suited to excel in various fields, including science, philosophy, literature, and the arts. This has allowed them to make significant contributions to human civilization, and to achieve a level of success and influence that is disproportionate to their relatively small numbers.\nOne example of the Jewish people\u0026rsquo;s intellectual contributions to human civilization can be seen in the field of science. Despite their relatively small population, Jews have made significant contributions to many branches of science, including physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Some of the most famous scientists in history were Jewish, including Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Robert Oppenheimer. In addition to science, Jewish thinkers and writers have also played an important role in shaping human thought and culture. The Hebrew Bible, for example, has been tremendously influential in the development of Western civilization, and has inspired countless works of literature, art, and music. Jewish philosophers such as Maimonides and Spinoza have also had a significant impact on human thought, and continue to be studied and debated to this day.\nIll. 2 - Antidiluvian queen on golden throne Safeguarding the secrets # So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. Genesis 3: 24.\nSoldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators‚Äô residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge.\nYahweh states that after the humans ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they were banished from the Garden of Eden and prevented from accessing the Tree of Life. The entrance to the creators\u0026rsquo; residence was guarded by soldiers with advanced weaponry to keep human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge.\nIt is suggested that the Elohim created human beings to be like them, but were concerned about the potential dangers of giving them access to their advanced scientific knowledge and the ability to extend life span (Tree of Life). The Elohim may have seen themselves as responsible stewards of this knowledge and wanted to ensure that it was not used irresponsibly or for destructive purposes. The Elohim who were banished to Earth after being condemned by their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government for wanting to give their human creations access to scientific knowledge were terrestrial keepers of that knowledge. This may have made them even more cautious about protecting their knowledge and keeping it from their human creations. The soldiers with advanced weaponry guarding the entrance to their residence can be seen as a measures of the Elohim government\u0026rsquo;s determination to protect their knowledge at all costs.\nIll. 3 - Defense equipment in front of silos Chimera # And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. Genesis 4: 3-4.\nThe creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the ‚Äútree of life‚Äù, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn this passage, Cain brings an offering of fruit to Yahweh, while Abel brings the firstlings of his flock and their fat. The passage suggests that the creators in exile, who were under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their superiors that the newly created people were good and would not turn against their creators. Through this, they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of the first human beings to benefit from the ‚Äútree of life,‚Äù allowing them to live for an exceptionally long time, as stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn this context, the Tree of Life can be seen as a sign of devotion because the creators in exile were willing to risk their own safety and well-being to provide their human creations with access to this technology. They believed that their human creations deserved to have the same opportunity to live long and productive lives as they did, and were willing to go to great lengths to ensure that this was made possible. By providing the humans with access to the Tree of Life, the creators were showing their commitment to their creations and their desire to see them thrive.\nThe fact that the creators had to convince their superiors to allow the humans to benefit from the Tree of Life suggests that this was not an easy decision to make. The Elohim government may have been concerned about the potential risks and dangers of allowing humans to live longer, and may have been hesitant to grant permission for this technology to be shared. By convincing their superiors to allow the humans to benefit from the Tree of Life, the creators were demonstrating their commitment to their creations and their belief in their potential to use this technology responsibly. This act of devotion and advocacy on behalf of their human creations can be seen as a significant gesture of love and solidarity.\nIt is safe to assume that the relationship between the banished Elohim and their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government was strained, if not outright hostile. The banishment of the Elohim from their home planet suggests that they were seen as a threat to the established order, possibly due to their advocacy for greater freedom and equality and their willingness to challenge the established norms regarding the dissemination of scientific knowledge. The government\u0026rsquo;s decision to punish the creators by banishing them to Earth and forcing the other scientists to abandon their experiments suggests a willingness to use harsh measures to maintain control over its population and prevent the spread of dangerous knowledge.\nIt is within the reasonable to assume further that the banished Elohim maintained some form of communication with their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government, perhaps in an attempt to reconcile their differences or negotiate a return to their previous status. However, the text does not provide any details regarding the nature of this communication, so it is difficult to say for certain what the relationship between the two parties looked like. It is also possible that the banished Elohim took measures to protect themselves and their knowledge from their home planet\u0026rsquo;s government, perhaps by developing new technologies or forming alliances with other groups who shared their views. Again, the text does not provide any specific details regarding these actions, so it is difficult to say for certain what the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s strategy may have been.\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. Genesis 6: 1-2.\nThe creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.\nYahweh refers to Genesis 6:1-2, which describes how the sons of Elohim took wives from among the daughters of men. According to the passage\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, the creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives. This suggests that the creators may have established relationships with humans, potentially forming families and intermingling with the human population.\nThis passage raises questions about the nature of the relationship between the banished Elohim and their human creations. It is possible that the creators saw themselves as benevolent benefactors or mentors to the humans, and sought to establish relationships with them in order to guide and protect them. Alternatively, the Elohim may have been motivated by a desire for companionship or a sense of loneliness, leading them to seek out human partners. It is also possible that the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s relationships with humans were more complex or fraught, potentially leading to tensions or conflicts between the two groups. The fact that the Elohim were banished by their own government suggests that there may have been significant disagreements or power struggles within Elohimian society, which could have influenced the nature of their relationship with humans.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make a small paranthesis here: The story in the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish religious text, is often seen as a parallel to the passage in Genesis 6:1-2. According to the Book of Enoch, the \u0026ldquo;sons of God\u0026rdquo;, clearly referring to the Elohim as a whole1, saw the beauty of human women and took them as wives, giving birth to a race of giants known as the Nephilim.\nThe parallels between the story in the Book of Enoch and the passage in Genesis 6:1-2 are striking, as both describe a situation in which supernatural beings take human women as wives and give birth to a new hybrid race of beings. In the Book of Enoch, the \u0026ldquo;sons of God\u0026rdquo; are explicitly identified as fallen beings, whereas in Genesis they are simply referred to as \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim,\u0026rdquo; a term which can be interpreted in various ways. The Enochian account is more precise in the sense that it tells us that there\u0026rsquo;s a specific subset of the Elohimian species that were having children of the Human species. The classifier used is \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo;2 which refers to the banished Elohim on planet Earth, clearly delimiting them from the remainder of the Elohimian civilization.\nIll. 4 - Group of individuals standing on golden floor Exceptional children # My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. Genesis 6: 3.\nLongevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the ‚Äútree of life‚Äù. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind‚Äôs progress was slowed down.\nIn this passage, Yahweh states that his spirit will not always strive with man because they are flesh and limited in their lifespan. He declares that their days shall be limited to 120 years. It is suggested that longevity is not hereditary and that the children of the newly created human beings did not automatically benefit from the \u0026ldquo;Tree of Life\u0026rdquo;. As a result, the secret of life was lost, and humanity\u0026rsquo;s progress was slowed down. This passage implies that the limitation of human lifespan had a significant impact on the development of human civilization, as it prevented humans from accumulating knowledge and experience over longer periods of time.\nThe Elohim home planet\u0026rsquo;s government may have been relieved because the loss of the secret of life meant that their creations, the humans, would not have the ability to challenge their authority or disrupt the established order of their society. The government of the Elohim may have seen the sharing of scientific knowledge and the ability to prolong life as potentially destabilizing factors, and the fact that these abilities were not hereditary may have provided some reassurance that they could maintain control over their creations.\nThe loss of the secret of life may have slowed down human progress, which may have been seen as a positive development by the government of the Elohim. As mentioned in the previous passage, the creators who wished to share knowledge with humans were seen as a progressive or revolutionary element within the Elohimian society, challenging the established order and advocating for greater freedom and equality. The government of the Elohim, on the other hand, represented a conservative or authoritarian element, seeking to maintain control and preserve the existing power structure. The loss of the secret of life may have been seen as a way to maintain the status quo and prevent any disruptive changes to the established order of their society.\nWhen the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. Genesis 6: 4.\nThere you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.\nThe passage describes how the offspring of the sons of Elohim (the creators living in exile) and the daughters of men became mighty men of renown. This suggests that the offspring of these unions possessed exceptional abilities and may have played an important role in human history. However, the actions of the Elohim in producing these offspring were seen as dangerous by the authorities on their distant planet, and as a result, they decided to destroy what had been created. The passage implies that the scientific progress on Earth was seen as a threat to the established order of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s society and that they were willing to take drastic measures to maintain control over their population. It is possible that the authorities saw the interbreeding between the Elohim and humans as a violation of some fundamental principle, or as a threat to the genetic purity of their civilization.\nThe drastic measures taken by the authorities to destroy what had been created suggests that they viewed the situation as a serious threat. It is possible that they believed that the interbreeding between the Elohim and humans would lead to some kind of catastrophic event or disruption of the natural order. Alternatively, they may have been concerned about the potential for the exceptional abilities of the offspring to upset the existing power structures on their home planet. Whatever the specific concerns may have been, the fact that the authorities took such drastic measures suggests that they viewed the situation as a major threat that required urgent action.\nDuring the second encounter with Yahweh, witnessed in the the second book \u0026ldquo;Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh makes a revelation that refers back to the children made during these prediluvian times.\nThere is an important revelation, which you may now make. The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a specific destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of ‚Äúthe sons of Elohim and the daughters of men‚Äù, as mentioned in Genesis. Their original mistake was to have mated with their scientific creations.\nYahweh reveals that the Jews are direct descendants of the Elohim who mated with their scientific creations, the daughters of men, as mentioned in Genesis. The Jews, therefore, have a specific destiny reserved for them because of their direct lineage to the Elohim. This revelation suggests that the relationship between the Elohim and their human creations was complex and intertwined, with significant consequences for human history and the fate of the Jewish people.\nIll. 5 - Landmark structure emitting bright beam into the sky Seventh day of creation # As per the sidereal astrology, The World Age refers to the 25,920-year precession of the equinoxes, also known as the Great Year. Each age lasts approximately 2,160 years, during which the vernal equinox moves through one of the twelve zodiacal constellations.\nThe Age of Cancer is said to have started around ‚Äì8,850 and ended around ‚Äì6,690 BCE. This period is believed to have been characterized by the emergence of agriculture and the domestication of animals. It was a time of significant technological progress, particularly in the development of tools and weapons made from copper and bronze.\nIf we consider the Seventh day of creation as the day of rest, it is typically associated with a time of peace and harmony, when all creation is in a state of balance and order. In the context of the Elohim story, this could be interpreted as a time when the creators had successfully established a stable and harmonious society on their home planet, marked by advanced scientific knowledge and a deep understanding of the natural world.\nDuring this age, the Elohim may have focused on cultivating their knowledge and developing new technologies, as well as exploring the mysteries of the universe. They may have also devoted time to the arts, music, and other creative pursuits, as a means of expressing their understanding of the world and their place within it.\nIt is also possible that the Seventh day of creation represents a time of reflection and introspection, when the creators took a step back to consider the impact of their actions and the consequences of their knowledge. They may have recognized the potential dangers of sharing their knowledge too freely or using it for destructive purposes, and may have taken steps to ensure that their discoveries were used responsibly and for the greater good.\nA quick recap # The phrase \u0026ldquo;Sons of Man\u0026rdquo; is a metaphorical or figurative expression. The word \u0026ldquo;of Man\u0026rdquo; refers to humanity as a whole, and \u0026ldquo;sons\u0026rdquo; emphasizes the shared human experience and identity. In contemporary usage, the phrase \u0026ldquo;Sons of Man\u0026rdquo; is not commonly used in everyday language. Instead, people tend to use terms such as \u0026ldquo;humanity,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;humankind.\u0026rdquo; In the same vein, the \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; refers to the entirety of the God-kind. If we use the original Hebrew term Elohim instead of God, we would refer the entirety of the Elohim-kind in these archaic terms as the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe original Hebrew term is Nephilim, a term borrowed from Hebrew ◊†÷∞◊§÷¥◊ô◊ú÷¥◊ô◊ù (‚Äúnefilim, fallen ones‚Äù), plural of ◊†÷∏◊§÷¥◊ô◊ú (‚Äúnaf√≠l, fallen one‚Äù).

The number eight is encoded in the amount of people entering Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark: Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives, a total of 8 people.\nThe Age of Gemini is associated with the eighth day of creation and represents a time of new beginnings and fresh starts. This is reflected in the story of Noah and the Flood, which is said to have taken place during this age. According to the biblical account, God was disappointed with the state of humanity and decided to cleanse the Earth with a flood, sparing only Noah and his family. The Age of Gemini is also associated with the concept of duality, reflected in the symbol of the twins. This age is said to represent a time of increased communication, exchange, and cooperation between different cultures and peoples. It is a time when ideas and knowledge are shared and disseminated, leading to increased understanding and collaboration.\nThe Decision # And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Genesis 6: 5.\nThe ‚Äúevil‚Äù in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being ‚Äúgood‚Äù, as far as those on the Elohim‚Äôs planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their ‚Äúevil‚Äù was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.\nWhat happened on Earth was deemed too dangerous to the authorities on the Elohimian home planet. The passage suggests that Elohim saw the wickedness of humans on Earth, as they desired to become scientific and independent, equal to their creators. This desire for progress and advancement was seen as \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; by the authorities on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, who preferred the new human beings to remain primitive and under their control. The conflict between the desire for progress and the desire for control can be seen as a fundamental tension that has played out throughout human history.\nAccording to the perspective presented in the text, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet government held a certain moral code that defined what was \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; From their point of view, the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; outcome was for the newly created human beings to remain primitive and dependent on their creators, while the \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; outcome was for humans to become independent and equal to their creators through scientific progress.\nThis suggests that the morality of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government was based on a hierarchical power structure, with the creators at the top and the humans below them. In this framework, it was considered \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; for the humans to remain subservient to their creators, while it was \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; for them to challenge their creators\u0026rsquo; power or to strive for equality with them. This moral code may have been enforced through the government\u0026rsquo;s control over scientific knowledge, as well as through the use of force to maintain the existing power structure.\nWhat is important to understand here is that the concept of good and evil presented in this interpretation of Genesis is tied to a specific perspective, that of the Elohim home planet\u0026rsquo;s government. The Elohim saw themselves as responsible stewards of scientific knowledge, and believed that sharing this knowledge with humans would be dangerous and could lead to destruction. From their perspective, it was \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; for humans to remain primitive and subservient to their creators, as this would ensure their safety and prevent them from acquiring dangerous knowledge.\nHowever, this perspective is not absolute and is subject to interpretation. Other individuals or societies may have different beliefs about what is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and what is \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; For example, a society that values progress and innovation may see the acquisition of scientific knowledge as \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and the restriction of knowledge as \u0026ldquo;evil.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, a society that values individual freedom may see the subjugation of one group by another as \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; and the pursuit of equality as \u0026ldquo;good.\u0026rdquo;\nIt can be inferred that the Elohim faction banished to Earth, including the group known as the Serpent, had a different moral code than the Elohim government from their home planet. They believed in sharing scientific knowledge with humanity and allowing them to progress and evolve, while the Elohim government sought to maintain control over their population and prevent the dissemination of dangerous knowledge. The group known as the Serpent, in particular, was portrayed as a small group of creators who challenged the established norms of their own civilization by advocating for the dissemination of scientific knowledge to humans. This act of defiance may have been seen as a threat to the government\u0026rsquo;s control over its population and to the established order of their society. As a result, they were punished by being sent into exile on Earth, while the other scientists were forced to abandon their experiments and leave the planet.\nThis suggests that the Serpent and the banished Elohim faction had a moral code that placed a high value on the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of civilization, even if it meant challenging the established order and risking their own well-being. They believed in the potential of humanity to reach their level of knowledge and saw themselves as mentors and guides to help them achieve this goal. This is in contrast to the moral code of the Elohim government, which placed a high value on maintaining control over their population and preventing the dissemination of dangerous knowledge.\nIll. 1 - Circular megalopolis seen from the sky The Preservation Project # The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.\nThis was true figuratively speaking, but in reality - and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this - a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nThe Elohim government, seeing the scientific progress of human beings as a threat, decided to destroy all life on Earth using nuclear missiles. However, the exiled creators asked Noah to build a spaceship that would preserve pairs of each species during the cataclysm. The preservation of a single living cell of each species, male and female, was sufficient to recreate the whole being, which was a colossal task but completed on time. Noah\u0026amp;rsquo;s Ark is therefore a space vessel capable of leaving the waters and going up to the orbit rather than a mere watercraft floating on the potentially cataclysmic oceans.\nThe overarching story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark as presented in the Bible can actually be understood as a metaphor for the larger scientific undertaking: The Elohim, who had created humans and other species on Earth, realized that a catastrophic event was imminent and that all life on Earth was at risk. To preserve the genetic material of each species, they instructed Noah to build a spaceship that would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm, containing a single living cell of each species, male and female.\nThe text suggests that this was not meant to be taken literally, but rather figuratively. The idea is that a single living cell contains all the genetic information necessary to recreate an entire being, similar to how the first living cell of a fetus contains all the information needed to create a human being. In this way, Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark can be seen as a metaphor for a larger project to preserve the genetic material of all species on Earth, which was accomplished by collecting and storing living cells from each species. This insight presents Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark not as a miraculous vessel that saved a select group of animals from a global flood, but rather as a symbol of humanity\u0026rsquo;s efforts to preserve the genetic diversity of life on Earth.\nThe preservation project would have involved collecting a single living cell of each species, male and female, and preserving them on board the spaceship. The process of preserving the genetic material would likely have involved advanced technology and techniques that are beyond our current understanding.\nOne possibility is that the genetic material was cryogenically preserved, which involves freezing the material at very low temperatures to slow down its metabolic processes and prevent decay. Another possibility is that the genetic material was stored in a highly stable and protected environment, such as within a specially designed container or within the structure of the spaceship itself. It is important to note that the details of how the preservation project was actually carried out are not provided in the passage, so any explanations would be speculative. However, the passage suggests that the exiled creators had all the necessary knowledge and technology that enabled them to undertake this monumental task.\nIll. 2 - Guarding groups collecting genetic material all over the world The spacecraft had three sections:\n\u0026hellip;and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. Genesis 6: 16.\nThis passage clearly reiterates that the ark was indeed a spacecraft, and needed to be constructed in a predefined manner based on blueprints provided by the banished Elohim, with the instruction to make it with three sections or floors: a lower section, a second section, and a third section. This is consistent with the idea that the ark was not just a wooden boat, but a technologically advanced spacecraft designed to preserve genetic material and sustain life during a catastrophic event.\nIll. 1 - Guarding groups collecting genetic material all over the world The Great Flood # When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe Great Flood caused by the nuclear explosion submerged the continent with a massive tidal wave and destroyed all life forms on the surface. However, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth in Noah\u0026rsquo;s spacecraft. Everything was preserved and guarded in time through the Ark spacecraft carrying genetic material of each species. This ensured the continuation of life on Earth after the fading away of the cataclysmic flood and its aftermath\u0026rsquo;s effects.\nThe Great Flood was a cataclysmic event that caused a global mass extinction and was responsible for breaking up the original supercontinent. The explosion that triggered the Great Flood was so powerful that it might have caused a shift in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis, which in turn resulted in the sinking of the ancient continent. This theory is supported by geological evidence that suggests that there was a major shift in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s tectonic plates around 8'000 years ago, which is consistent with the timeline proposed in the book. The Flood was also responsible for depositing large amounts of sedimentary rock and other geological formations that can still be observed today. Overall, the theory suggests that the Great Flood was a catastrophic event that fundamentally altered the course of human history and the planet itself.\nAs the floodwaters receded, they left behind massive sedimentary deposits, which only over a few months or years, turned into solid rock formations. The shifting of tectonic plates, caused by the catastrophic event, also resulted in the creation of mountain ranges and the breakup of the original supercontinent, Pangaea. The movement of the plates and the resulting collisions caused intense pressure and wolding of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust, leading to the formation of mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, the Andes or even the Alps. The layers of sedimentary rock formations that were deposited during the Great Flood can also be seen as evidence of the event. The distinct layers represent different periods of time, and the fossils found within them provide clues about the types of creatures that existed during each period.\nIll. 3 - Cosmic impact causing Earth-wide cataclysmic mass-extinction event The ark\u0026hellip; was lift up above the earth. Genesis 7: 17.\nAs you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted ‚Äúabove‚Äù the Earth and not ‚Äúon‚Äù the water.\nThe passage highlights that the ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water, as mentioned in Genesis 7:17. The preservational spacecraft managed to escape in time. The description of the ark (spacecraft) being lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth strongly suggests that it was not a conventional boat as conventional interpretations still persist to explain, but rather a spacecraft that has to be capable of leaving the waters into the space of air.\nIt is noteworthy, that there are reasons to believe that the Great Flood happened around 6'000 BC when the Sun was rising in the house of Gemini during the vernal equinox, aligning with Castor, one of the majors star (which actually consists of multiple stars) of the constellation.\nIll. 4 - Ark spacecraft in safe orbital space Reseeding # Then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:\nAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. Genesis 7: 24.\nThis passage states that after the flood, the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days, implying that it took that long for the radioactive fallout to dissipate and the environment to become safe for the Ark\u0026rsquo;s passengers to disembark.\nWhen the decision was made to destroy all life on Earth, they sent nuclear missiles to achieve the goal of mass-extinction as pointed out at the outset of this chapter. The resulting explosions would have created radioactive fallout, which would have been dangerous to any remaining life on the planet, including the preserved genetic material on the spacecraft. Therefore, it was necessary to wait until the radioactive fallout had dissipated before landing on the ground and beginning the process of reseeding the planet with life.\nSome method of nuclear decontamination was necessary to shorten the amount of time they had to wait in safer outer space before attempting to land back on the grounds of Earth.\nLater it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.\nAnd Elohim remembered Noah\u0026hellip; and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged. Genesis 8: 1.\nThe passage describes how after the flood, the Ark spacecraft carrying Noah and the genetic legacy of all life created on Earth by the Elohim on Earth landed on on dry land.\nAfter monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:\nAnd Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. Genesis 8: 20.\nAfter the Great Flood, the banished creators who had saved the human race from destruction, instructed Noah to release the first batch of resurrected animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere, which turned out to be a successful experiment. The recreation of all animals and human beings followed. The human survivors were then asked to show gratitude to their creators by working and multiplying. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and cattle to the creators. He built an altar and offered burnt offerings of every clean beast and fowl to Yahweh as a sign of their gratitude. Humans were thankful.\nThe goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.\nAnd by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. Genesis 10: 32.\nthe purpose of humanity is to achieve scientific progress, and after the Flood, the human races were returned to their original places of creation. The preservation of genetic material in the Ark made it possible to recreate all species of animals that had been destroyed during the Flood. After the Flood, the human population and animal kingdom were thus able to start anew and repopulate the Earth. The passage from Genesis 10:32 suggests that the descendants of Noah\u0026rsquo;s three sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth) were responsible for repopulating a specific part of the Earth in today\u0026rsquo;s Fertile Crescent and therefore creating the various nations at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. This can be seen as a symbol of the importance of diversity in human society, with different races and cultures contributing to the overall progress and development of humanity.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of time it would have taken to recreate each species from the genetic data preserved aboard the Ark spacecraft. However, it is clear that this would have been a massive undertaking, requiring advanced scientific knowledge and technology. The text suggests that the Elohim creators were able to successfully recreate each animal species preserved that way. It is noteworthy that some species were deliberately chosen not to be recreated at this moment in time. A prominent example here are the dinosaurs.\nNoahic covenant # The creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n\u0026hellip;for the imagination of man‚Äôs heart is evil. Genesis 8: 21.\nThe creators were pleased to see that the humans had expressed gratitude for their preservation and promised not to try to destroy their creation again. They realized that it was natural for humans to desire scientific progress. Despite this, they acknowledged that the human heart can be prone to evil, as stated in Genesis 8:21. The preservation of life was seen as a positive outcome. Having safeguarded life was good in the eyes of the banished creators.\nThe covenant established with Noah in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noahic covenant, in which God promises never again to wipe out all life on Earth through a flood and designates the rainbow as a symbol of the \u0026ldquo;eternal covenant,\u0026rdquo; can be seen as a precursor to the Noahide Laws. The covenant established with Noah [Gen 9:1-17] extends to every living being, including humans and other creatures. As part of this agreement, the creators pledges never again to wipe out all life on Earth through a flood, and designates the rainbow as a symbol of the \u0026ldquo;eternal covenant\u0026rdquo; between the Elohim and every living creature, both human and animal, on the planet.\nThe Seven Laws refer to the set of moral and religious laws that according to Jewish tradition, were given to all of humanity through Noah after the flood. These laws are also known as the Noahide Laws or the Seven Noahide Laws. According to Jewish tradition, these laws are applicable to all human beings, regardless of their religion or nationality, and are considered the foundation of a just and moral society.\nThe Tower of Babel # But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators‚Äô planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket - The Tower of Babel.\nAnd now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Genesis 11: 6.\nThe people of Israel, who were considered the most intelligent race, made remarkable progress and with the help of the exiled creators, were able to conquer space. The creators wanted the new human beings to go to their planet to obtain their forgiveness by demonstrating that they were intelligent, scientific, grateful, and peaceful. They built an enormous rocket, known as the Tower of Babel, which reflected their aspirations to achieve great feats beyond their current capabilities.\nIt is possible that it could have been built in Eridu or a nearby location close to the Persian Gulf. This would have provided easy access to a large body of water that could have been used for rocket launch and recovery operations. Additionally, being near a body of water could have provided a source of fuel or other resources needed for the rocket\u0026rsquo;s construction and operation.\nThe people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this. They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.\nGo to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another‚Äôs speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. Genesis 11: 7-8.\nThe people on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet became alarmed when they heard about the Tower of Babel, a rocket built by the people of Israel with the help of the exiled creators. They feared that the new human beings may be able to reach their planet and asked Yahweh to intervene. Yahweh then caused confusion by confounding their language, leading to their scattering across the Earth. This event is described in Genesis 11:7-8.\nthe people on the distant planet who were observing the Earth became frightened when they heard that the people of Israel were making remarkable progress in space exploration and were building an enormous rocket to go to the creators\u0026rsquo; planet to obtain their pardon. To prevent this from happening, they decided to intervene and confound the language of the people building the tower so that they would not understand each other\u0026rsquo;s speech.\nSo they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.\nPreventive action\nWar in Heaven # To avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nIn that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. Isaiah 27: 1.\nThe creators built their bases on high mountains and at the bottom of the sea to avoid being disturbed by humans. The mountain stations were gradually abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The banished creators had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nThe idea of a War in Heaven or a cosmic conflict between older and younger gods is a common theme in various mythologies and religious traditions. In the context of the Elohim and the banished creators, it is suggested that there was a power struggle or conflict between the original creators and a new faction that emerged on the home planet.\nThis conflict led to the banishment of the creators to Earth, where they were able to establish a presence and influence human history. The reference to \u0026ldquo;leviathan\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the dragon in the sea\u0026rdquo; in Isaiah 27:1 can be seen as symbolic of this conflict between the older and younger factions, with the \u0026ldquo;dragon\u0026rdquo; representing the banished creators who took refuge in the oceans.\nOverall, this suggests that the Elohim and the banished creators had different agendas and approaches to their interactions with humanity and the universe, leading to conflict and tension between them.\nAt that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.\nThis is a small but crucial sentence in the Ra√´lian canon, not to be mentioned again. The infamous myths about a pantheon of younger Gods fighting another pantheon of older Gods fully comes to fruition here, the so called \u0026ldquo;Theomachy\u0026rdquo;. The government of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet wanted to destroy the banished creators who had come to Earth and created humans. This indicates a conflict or disagreement between the two groups, possibly due to differing ideologies, beliefs, or goals. It also suggests that the creators may have been seen as a threat to the established order or power structure on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, leading to a desire to eliminate them.\nA quick recap # "},{"id":"17","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86%D0%B0/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –¢–µ–ª—å—Ü–∞","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –¢–µ–ª—å—Ü–∞, —Å 4530 –ø–æ 2370 –≥–æ–¥ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç., —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–æ–º –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"Wheel of Heaven\", —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—è –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –ë–ª–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Ü–æ–≤. –í —ç—Ç—É —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É —Ä–∞–Ω–µ–µ –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—Ü—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø–æ–º–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –∏ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–æ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ—é —Ä–æ–¥–Ω—É—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—É. –û–Ω–∏ –∑–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∑–∞ –ª—é–¥–µ–π –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–ª–µ–∫–∞—è –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –∫ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ –∏ –µ–µ –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º. –¢–µ–º –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–µ–º –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, –∂–µ–ª–∞—é—â–∏–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∏, —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞—Ö –°–æ–¥–æ–º –∏ –ì–æ–º–æ—Ä—Ä–∞. –≠—Ç–∏ –ª—é–¥–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ä–∞–Ω–µ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç—ã, –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –æ—Ç–æ–º—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ç–µ–º, –∫—Ç–æ –ø—ã—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è –∏—Ö —É–Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å. –≠—Ç–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≥–ª–∞ —Å–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ –∞–ø–æ–≥–µ—è –≤ —É–Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞—Ç–æ–º–Ω—ã–π –≤–∑—Ä—ã–≤, –∫–∞–∫ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–æ –≤ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–µ –æ –°–æ–¥–æ–º–µ –∏ –ì–æ–º–æ—Ä—Ä–µ.","content":"The Age of Taurus lasts from ‚Äì4'530 to ‚Äì2'370 and follows the Age of Gemini which lasted up to ‚Äì4'530.\nPeace in Heaven # The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.\nThe exiled creators were eventually forgiven and permitted to return to their original planet. They used this opportunity to advocate on behalf of their creation, the humans on Earth. This led to the distant planet focusing their attention on Earth as they realized it was home to the people they had created.\nAccording to the text, the home planet\u0026rsquo;s government ultimately won the conflict and decided to pardon the exiled creators. The text does not provide specific details on how this conflict was resolved, but it suggests that the creators were able to plead their case and convince the government of their planet to forgive them. After the pardon, the creators were allowed to return to their original planet, and everyone on the distant planet became interested in Earth because it was inhabited by beings that they themselves had created. It is possible that the resolution of the conflict involved a negotiation or agreement between the two factions, but the text does not provide further details.\nSodom and Gomorrah # But among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them.\nThe passage talks about how a group of humans, the ones that were scattered all over during the construction of the interstellar spacecraft remembered in the Bible as the Tower of Babel, who nursed a desire for vengeance gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities which were located in the Jordan River plain, precisely where now the Dead Sea is located, in the biblical region of Canaan. They had salvaged a few scientific secrets and prepared an expedition to punish those who had tried to destroy them. This suggests that while the conflict between the creators and the home planet\u0026rsquo;s government had been resolved, there were still humans on Earth who held grudges and had access to advanced scientific knowledge.\nConsequently, the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on:\nAnd there came two angels to Sodom at even 3. Genesis 19: 1.\nThe creators sent two angels as spies to investigate what was happening in Sodom. This is mentioned in Genesis 19:1. The creators\u0026rsquo; authority from the distant planet of the Elohim used espionage as a means of gathering intelligence on the actions of humans on Earth. In this particular case, the creators sent two spies in the form of angels to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah. The use of spies suggests that the creators were monitoring and keeping tabs on human activities, possibly to ensure that humans were not attempting to create any technological advances that could pose a threat to their authority.\nIll. 1 - Red-colored cityscape Some humans tried to kill them, but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon:\nAnd they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great. Genesis 19: 11.\nThe two spies sent by the creators to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah were attacked by some humans who tried to kill them. However, the spies were able to defend themselves by using a pocket atomic weapon that blinded their attackers, both small and great. This event is described in the book of Genesis 19:11.\nThe passage describes how the two spies sent by the creators to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah were attacked by some of the humans there. In order to defend themselves, the spies used a pocket atomic weapon to blind their attackers. The phrase \u0026ldquo;smote the men\u0026rdquo; means that they struck or hit them with the weapon, causing them to become blind. The passage highlights the use of advanced technology by the creators, who were able to equip their agents with powerful weapons to protect themselves and carry out their mission.\nThey warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:\nUp, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city. Genesis 19: 14\nAs the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.\nEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. Genesis 19: 17.\nIn this passage, the two spies who were sent to investigate Sodom and Gomorrah warned the peaceful inhabitants to leave the city because it was going to be destroyed with an atomic explosion. The inhabitants did not fully grasp the severity of the situation and did not leave the city with a sense of urgency. The spies had to urge them to escape for their lives and not to look back. The plan was to annihilate the two cities of the Jordan plain.\nThe passage describes the warning given by the two spies to those who were peaceful in Sodom and Gomorrah to leave the town, as it was going to be destroyed by an atomic explosion. The warning was heeded, but the people were not in a hurry to leave as they did not understand the full danger of an atomic explosion. The spies urged them to escape for their lives, not to look behind them, and not to stay in the plain. This passage suggests that the creators had access to advanced technology and weaponry, including atomic weapons, similar to those employed to cause the Great Flood but evidently less potent in their strength, and were willing to use them to protect themselves or achieve their objectives.\nAnd the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:\nThen Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. Genesis 19: 24-26.\nAs you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.\nThe passage describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah through a rain of brimstone and fire from heaven. This destruction caused the death of all inhabitants and vegetation in the area. However, Lot\u0026rsquo;s wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt, which is suggested to be a result of the burns caused by the atomic explosion that killed those who were too close to the impact. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were both annihilated. The usage of the phrase \u0026ldquo;the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and brimstone from the sky\u0026rdquo; strongly suggests in archaic language of the Bible that that an atomic explosion is being described.\nIll. 2 - Tactical explosion over the sea Abraham # Now that Sodom and Gomorrah were both razed to the ground and most likely left the a huge crater that became known as the Dead Sea, Abraham, the infamous Hebrew patriarch of Biblical fame, does get introduced.\nLater, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them.\nThe creators, after the destruction of many leading intellectuals, observed that the people of Israel had relapsed into a semi-primitive state. They wanted to test if the people, and their leader in particular, still had positive feelings towards them.\nThis is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.\nLay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. Genesis 22: 12.\nThe passage describes a test conducted by the creators to see if Abraham\u0026rsquo;s feelings towards them were strong enough. It is mentioned that Abraham was willing to sacrifice his own son as part of this test, but the creators intervened and stopped him from doing so. The creators were satisfied with the outcome of the experiment and acknowledged that Abraham had strong feelings towards them.\nThis test was intended to see if Abraham still had positive feelings towards the creators, even after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and to test his loyalty and faith in their commandments. The creators were pleased with Abraham\u0026rsquo;s response, and the passage indicates that he passed the test and showed his reverence and fear towards them.\nIll. 2 - Individual standing on open-air plaza Regression # Because of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:\nPut away the foreign gods that are among you. Genesis 35: 2.\nThe passage suggests that after the destruction of advanced centers of civilization, such as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the elimination of intellectuals, human society regressed to a primitive state. The people began worshipping inanimate objects, such as pieces of stone and idols, instead of the actual creators. The quote, \u0026ldquo;Put away the foreign gods that are among you,\u0026rdquo; implies a call to abandon these idolatrous practices and return to the worship of the true creators.\nThe Elohim were seen as the creators of humanity and responsible for the progress and knowledge that early civilizations had achieved. The practice of idolatry, or the worship of physical objects or idols as deities, can be seen as a result of a loss of understanding and knowledge of the true nature of the Elohim. In the absence of the creators or their direct guidance, humans may have sought to fill the void with physical representations of their belief systems. Therefore, the admonition to \u0026ldquo;put away the foreign gods\u0026rdquo; can be seen as a call to return to the knowledge and understanding of the true creators and the rejection of false idols.\nThe line of thinking that idolatry was the result of forgetting the true creators and adoring pieces of stone and idols could have led to the emergence of monotheism in several ways.\nFirstly, it could have led to the idea that there was only one true God, the creator of everything, and that all other gods and idols were false and had no power. This idea may have arisen from the belief that the true creators were so powerful that they could not be represented by a physical object and therefore any such representation was a false idol.\nSecondly, the idea that idolatry was the result of forgetting the true creators may have led to the belief that a single deity or group of deities was responsible for the creation of everything, including humans. This belief could have evolved into a monotheistic religion where there is only one God who is responsible for everything in existence.\nFinally, the concept of idolatry being the result of forgetting the true creators may have led to the belief that the true creators were the only beings deserving of worship and adoration. This could have led to the development of a monotheistic religion where the worship of any other deity or idol was considered to be wrong and against the will of the true creators.\nIll. 3 - Two individuals searching for remainders Quick recap # "},{"id":"18","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –û–≤–Ω–∞","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –û–≤–Ω–∞, –æ—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Å 2370 –ø–æ 210 –≥–æ–¥ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç., —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –¢–µ–ª—å—Ü–∞ –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"Wheel of Heaven\". –≠—Ç–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–µ–Ω–∞ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è–º–∏, –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å –ú–æ–∏—Å–µ–µ–º, –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤–æ–π —Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä–æ–π –≤ –∏—É–¥–∞–∏–∑–º–µ. –°—é–∂–µ—Ç –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á—É –ú–æ–∏—Å–µ—è —Å –≥–æ—Ä—è—â–∏–º –∫—É—Å—Ç–æ–º –∫–∞–∫ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–µ–π, –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–µ, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–π –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ. –ö—Ä–æ–º–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –≤ —ç—Ç—É —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ –æ–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª—è –ø–æ–¥ —Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤–µ–ª–∏ –∏—Ö –¥–Ω–µ–º –≤ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–ø–µ –æ–±–ª–∞–∫–∞ –∏ –Ω–æ—á—å—é –≤ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–ø–µ –æ–≥–Ω—è, –∫–∞–∫ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–æ –≤ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ –ò—Å—Ö–æ–¥. –≠—Ç–∏ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è –∏–ª–ª—é—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—é—â–µ–µ—Å—è –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤ –≤ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞.","content":"The Age of Aries lasts from ‚Äì2'370 to ‚Äì210 and follows the Age of Taurus which lasted up to ‚Äì2'370.\nMoses # In Exodus, we appeared to Moses.\nAnd the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. Exodus 3: 2.\nThe passage describes a significant event in the Hebrew Bible when Moses, a key figure in Judaism, encountered an angel of Yahweh, the God of Israel. The angel appeared to Moses in a flame of fire that was emanating from a bush. Despite the fire, the bush was not consumed or burnt. This miraculous occurrence caught Moses\u0026rsquo; attention, and he approached the bush. From within the bush, the angel of Yahweh spoke to Moses and revealed his divine mission to lead the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt and into the Promised Land. Moses was chosen for a special mission.\nA rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.\nThis passage suggests that the description given in the Bible of the appearance of an angel of Yahweh in Exodus 3:2 may have been the result of an encounter with an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The author is drawing a comparison between the experience of Moses and the possible experience of a Brazilian tribesman encountering a modern-day spacecraft, implying that both encounters may have been similar in nature. The reference to illuminating the trees without burning them suggests that the spacecraft may have had some kind of advanced technology that allowed it to land without causing damage to the surrounding environment.\nThe people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.\nExodus # The beginning of Exodus describes all that we had to do to help liberate the people of Israel. Once departed, we guided them to the country, which we had destined for them:\nAnd Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night. Exodus 13: 21.\nThe passage describes how the Elohim guided and helped the people of Israel to liberate themselves and led them to the land that was destined for them. The Elohim were said to have gone before the people, leading them by day in a pillar of a cloud and by night in a pillar of fire, providing them with light and guiding their way.\nQuick recap # "},{"id":"19","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B1/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –†—ã–±","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –†—ã–±, –æ—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Å 210 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –¥–æ –Ω.—ç. –¥–æ 1950 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –Ω.—ç., –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –û–≤–Ω–∞ –∏ –Ω–µ–¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—à–ª–∞ –≤ –≠–ø–æ—Ö—É –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ „ÄäWheel of Heaven„Äã. –≠—Ç–∞ —ç—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–µ–Ω–∞ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è–º–∏, –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Ä–æ–ª—å—é –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞, —á—å–µ–π –º–∏—Å—Å–∏–µ–π –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω—ã –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ –≤—Å–µ–º—É –º–∏—Ä—É, —Å–ª—É–∂–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏—è —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–æ—è—â—É—é —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏. –≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è, –Ω–∞—á–∞–≤—à–∞—è—Å—è –≤ 1945 –≥–æ–¥—É —Å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ–º —è–¥–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏–∏ –∏ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –≤—Ä–µ–º—è —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∞, –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è—è —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É –ø–µ—Ä–µ–æ—Å–º—ã—Å–ª–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—é—é –º—É–¥—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—å —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏–∑–º—É. –ö—Ä–æ–º–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –≤ –≠–ø–æ—Ö—É –†—ã–± –≤—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫–∞, —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç –∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–π –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏ –∏ –∏–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—è–Ω–∏–Ω–∞, —É–Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–ø–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –∫–∞–∫ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–æ –≤ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–µ –æ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ò–∏—Å—É—Å–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞.","content":"The Age of Pisces lasted from ‚Äì210 BC to 1950 CE and followed the Age of Aries which lasted up to ‚Äì210. This World Age just ended very recently and the transition from the Age of Pisces to the new Age of Aquarius is still being felt.\nThe importance of the Biblical scriptures # Christ‚Äôs role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything.\nThe significance of Biblical scriptures lies in their ability to convey essential truths about our existence and the world around us. Christ\u0026rsquo;s mission was to disseminate these truths globally, ensuring their preservation for future generations. In the age of science, the knowledge found in the Bible can be better understood, providing evidence and insights for humanity.\nIf we consider the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1945 with the development of nuclear power and the advent of information systems, to be synonymous with the age of science, several implications arise. The Age of Aquarius, which will be the main focus in the next chapter bearing the same name, is often associated with a time of increased knowledge, technology, and human potential. In this context, the age of science represents a period where humanity gains a deeper understanding of the world, enabling us to reexamine and reinterpret ancient wisdom, such as the Biblical scriptures, through a modern lens. During the Age of Aquarius, scientific advancements have led to remarkable discoveries and innovations, which have significantly shaped our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The development of nuclear power, for instance, has not only revolutionized energy production but also provided us with a glimpse into the immense power contained within the fabric of matter itself. Similarly, the arrival of information systems has transformed our ability to communicate, share knowledge, and access vast amounts of information at an unprecedented scale.\nJesus Christ # The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:\nShe was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Matthew 1: 18.\n"},{"id":"20","href":"/ru/intro/%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%8F/","title":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è","description":"–≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è, –æ—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Å 1950 –ø–æ 4110 –≥–æ–¥ –Ω.—ç., —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–µ–π —ç—Ä–æ–π –≤ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ \"Wheel of Heaven\", —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—è –∑–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–æ–π –†—ã–±. –≠—Ç–∞ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞, –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞–∫ –ù–æ–≤–∞—è –≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞, –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤–∞–∂–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥ –≤ –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ø–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏–≥–º–∞—Ö. –û–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –∫–æ–Ω–µ—Ü –º–∏—Ä–∞ –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏, –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞—è –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –µ–µ —Ä–æ–ª–∏ –≤ –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∫–µ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∫ –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—é –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π. –≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –†—ã–±, —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–º –∏ –µ–≥–æ –∞–ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞–º–∏, –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –≤ –≠–ø–æ—Ö—É –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É—é—â—É—é –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π, –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—è –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª—å –≤ 1946 –≥–æ–¥—É. –≠—Ç–∞ —ç—Ä–∞ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–¥–≤–∏–≥–æ–º –≤ –≥–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∏ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏, —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º –∏ —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É—é—â–∏–º —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∏ –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è—Ö.","content":"The Age of Aquarius lasts from 1950 CE to 4110 CE and followed the Age of Pisces which lasted up to 1950 CE. While you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, chances are high that you\u0026rsquo;re reading this during the time span of the Age of Aquarius. This World Age is now and is commonly referred to the New Age.\nNew Age # We transitioned into the Age of Aquarius which folloed the Age of Pisces. The transition from one World Age to the next can still be felt to this very day.\nThe time of the end of the world has arrived. Not the end of the world as in a catastrophe destroying the Earth, but the end of the world of the Church, which has completed its work. It performed this role more or less effectively. It was a task of vulgarization, making it possible for your creators to be recognized when they return. As you have noticed, the Christian church is dying. It is the end of this world because its mission has been fulfilled, albeit with quite a few mistakes because it tried for so long to deify the creators.\nThe transition into the Age of Aquarius, following the Age of Pisces, has brought about significant changes that are still felt today. This shift marks the end of the world for the Church, as its mission of spreading awareness about the creators has been completed. While the Church has faced challenges and made mistakes in trying to deify the creators, its decline signifies the fulfillment of its role in preparing for the return of these creators in the new age.\nVulgarization of the truth has been completed. The completion of the vulgarization of the Truth through the Bible and other authentic religious scriptures involves several aspects. The Bible has been translated into numerous languages and distributed across the globe, making its teachings accessible to a vast number of people, regardless of their linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\nThroughout the past 2000 years since the Bible got canonized by the Church, religious leaders, scholars, and theologians have devoted their lives to interpreting and teaching the seemingly complex narrative concepts found within the Bible. These interpretations have led to the establishment of various religious denominations and schools of thought, each offering their unique perspectives on the scripture and while preserving the overall scriptural body of the Truth getting ouf of touch which is original meaning.\nAlso, artistic expressions, such as paintings, sculptures, music, and literature, have played a vital role in conveying the Bible\u0026rsquo;s messages to a broader audience. These artistic endeavors have often simplified and illustrated the biblical stories, making them more relatable and engaging for people from all walks of life.\nThe Age of Pisces was the age of Christ and his fishermen, and the Age of Aquarius, which follows, began in 1946. This is the era in which the people of Israel found their country again:\nAnd it shall come to pass in that day\u0026hellip; that there shall be the noise of a cry from the pisces 19 gate\u0026hellip; Zephaniah 1: 10.\nIn the passage from the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains that the Age of Pisces was the age of Christ and his fishermen, while the Age of Aquarius, which began in 1946, marked the period when the people of Israel reclaimed their country. This event was prophesied in Zephaniah 1:10, referencing a cry from the Pisces gate, symbolizing the transition between the two ages and the significant changes that would follow.\nThe return of the Jewish people to Israel, as it was predicted, is a sign of the golden age:\nI will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory. Isaiah 43: 5-7.\nIn this passage from the Book Which Tells The Truth, the return of the Jewish people to Israel is highlighted as a sign of the golden age. The prophecy, as described in Isaiah 43:5-7, foretells the gathering of the Jewish people from all directions‚Äîeast, west, north, and south‚Äîreturning to their homeland. This event serves as a fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s plan, as they are created for \u0026ldquo;His glory\u0026rdquo; and have been called by \u0026ldquo;His name\u0026rdquo;. The Golden Age has arrived.\nThe Truth # People of the Earth, you fly in the heavens, and your voices are carried to the four corners of the Earth by means of radio waves. So the time has come for you to know the truth.\n"},{"id":"21","href":"/ru/intro/%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–í–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–∞—è

This idea is supported by the observed uniformity and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which suggests that the universe is isotropic (the same in all directions) and homogeneous (the same at all points).\nAdditionally, the fact that we have not yet observed a distinct edge to the universe, despite our increasing technological capabilities and knowledge, also supports the idea of an infinite universe.\nMagen David ‚ú° # Infinity in time # The concept of infinite time is related to the idea that time has always existed and will always exist, without any beginning or end. This idea is based on the idea that time is a fundamental aspect of the universe and cannot be created or destroyed.\nIn physics, the concept of time as an infinite and unchanging entity is supported by the laws of thermodynamics, which suggest that time is irreversible and that entropy (a measure of the disorder of a system) always increases over time. This suggests that the universe has a definite history and that time cannot be reversed, supporting the idea of an infinite and unchanging time.\nSwastika ‡øï # See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Mass effect Wiki ‚Ä∫ Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Star of David Wiki ‚Ä∫ Swastika\n"},{"id":"30","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è","description":"–ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è, –Ω–∞–±–æ—Ä –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–π, —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏—Ö –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–æ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —É —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –±—ã–ª–æ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ò—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä–æ–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ê–ø–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–ø—Å–∏—Å–∞.","content":"The Bible is an anthology of religious texts, written and assembled over many centuries, regarded as sacred in Jewish, Christian, and, to some extent, Islamic traditions. Its significance cannot be understated; it has shaped civilizations, informed legal systems, influenced literature and art, and guided the spiritual lives of billions of people worldwide. However, it isn\u0026rsquo;t a single book authored by one individual. Instead, the Bible is a complex library of texts, encompassing a wide range of literary genres - histories, prophecies, poetry, wisdom literature, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Understanding the Bible, therefore, involves recognizing this diversity and appreciating the various religious traditions that interpret it.\nOrigins and historical context # The origins of the Bible lie in the ancient Near East, in the cradle of human civilization, where writing systems first developed. The biblical texts were primarily composed in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, each reflecting the socio-cultural contexts of their time.\nThe Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh in Jewish tradition, is foundational for both Judaism and Christianity. It consists of texts written and edited between the 12th and 2nd century BCE. The Tanakh is divided into three parts: the Torah, also known as the Pentateuch or the Law, comprises the first five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy; the Nevi\u0026rsquo;im, or the Prophets; and the Ketuvim, or the Writings, including Psalms, Proverbs, Job, and others. Each of these sections presents a rich tapestry of genres, themes, and theologies, reflecting on various aspects of human existence and relationships between humanity and the divine.\nOn the other hand, the New Testament, which is significant to Christian tradition, contains texts written in the first century CE by various early Christian communities. These include the Gospels - narratives of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s life and teachings - along with letters (or Epistles) written by apostles like Paul and Peter, and the apocalyptic book of Revelation. The New Testament texts reflect the early Christian understanding of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s teachings and their implications for both individuals and communities.\nCanonization # The process of canonization - determining which texts should be considered authoritative and included in the Bible - wasn\u0026rsquo;t a straightforward or universal process. Instead, it occurred over centuries and was influenced heavily by theological, political, and societal factors. Jewish communities recognized the Tanakh as their canon by the end of the 1st century CE, while different Christian communities took until the 4th century CE to reach a consensus on the New Testament canon.\nFurthermore, the Bible varies among Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian traditions. Some Christian traditions, such as the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, include additional books known as the Deuterocanonical or Apocryphal books. These books, written during the intertestamental period, are regarded as valuable but secondary in authority to the books in the Hebrew Bible. Protestant traditions, following Martin Luther\u0026rsquo;s lead during the Reformation, reject these additional books as non-canonical.\nApocryphas # The term \u0026lsquo;Apocrypha\u0026rsquo; often refers to a collection of Jewish writings that are included in some Christian Bibles but are excluded from the Hebrew Bible. These works, also known as deuterocanonical books in some traditions, were written during the intertestamental period - the period between the writing of the last Old Testament book (approximately 400 BCE) and the first New Testament book (around 50 CE).\nIncluded in this category are books like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (also called Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, and First and Second Maccabees, among others. These books, along with some additional texts and additions to canonical books like Daniel and Esther, are recognized by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as part of their Old Testament.\nThe Protestants, following Martin Luther, tend to exclude these books from their canon, considering them useful but not authoritative. The term \u0026lsquo;Apocrypha\u0026rsquo; in Protestant usage can sometimes also include several other non-canonical Jewish and Christian writings from various periods.\nNon-Canonical Texts # Alongside the Apocrypha, there are a plethora of Jewish and Christian texts that are not included in the standard canons of scripture but have been influential in some circles or provide important insights into ancient religious thought. These include Pseudepigrapha, Gnostic texts, and several other early Christian writings.\nPseudepigrapha are Jewish texts that are attributed to biblical figures but were not included in either the canon of the Hebrew Bible or the Apocrypha. Examples include the Books of Enoch, the Jubilees, and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.\nIn early Christian tradition, there are many texts, sometimes called the New Testament Apocrypha, that were not included in the New Testament canon. These include several Gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, numerous Acts such as the Acts of Paul and Thecla, and a variety of Epistles and Apocalypses.\nGnostic texts, often found among the New Testament Apocrypha, are a diverse collection of writings that reflect the teachings of various Gnostic sects in the early Christian era. Many of these were discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt in 1945, including texts like the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip.\nList of Biblical scriptures # Here is an expanded list of Biblical scriptures categorized primarily according to their inclusion in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and then branching out to other Jewish, Christian, and related texts:\n1.

Documentary hypothesis # One of the significant developments in the modern scholarly understanding of the Bible, particularly the Torah/Pentateuch, is the Documentary Hypothesis. This theory suggests that the first five books of the Bible aren\u0026rsquo;t the work of a single author but were composed from four distinct sources, known by their respective letters J (Yahwist), E (Elohist), D (Deuteronomist), and P (Priestly). Each of these sources is characterized by distinct literary styles, theological emphases, and historical contexts.\nThe Yahwist source (J), for example, uses the divine name Yahweh and depicts God in very anthropomorphic terms. In contrast, the Elohist source (E) refers to God as Elohim and presents God in a more transcendent way. The Deuteronomist source (D) is primarily concerned with the law and covenant, while the Priestly source (P) focuses on matters of ritual and worship.\nAlthough not all scholars agree on the details of the Documentary Hypothesis, it offers a valuable framework for understanding the Pentateuch. It highlights the Bible\u0026rsquo;s complex composition and the diverse theological perspectives present within it.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls # The Dead Sea Scrolls are an invaluable historical treasure, comprising a vast collection of Jewish documents written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Discovered between 1947 and 1956 in eleven caves near the northwestern edge of the Dead Sea, the documents offer an unprecedented insight into the life and beliefs of Jews during the Second Temple period of history (537 BC to AD 70).\nOrigins and discovery # The first of these scrolls were found by a Bedouin shepherd in the vicinity of the ancient site of Khirbet Qumran. This discovery initiated a decade-long archaeological expedition that resulted in the uncovering of thousands of fragments belonging to nearly 900 different scrolls. The texts, concealed for nearly two millennia, were preserved by the arid desert conditions, and are considered the most significant archaeological discovery of the 20th century.\nContents and importance # The collection includes a diverse array of writings: religious texts, commentaries, apocalyptic literature, sectarian documents, and even legal contracts and deeds. Most famously, the Dead Sea Scrolls encompass copies of books from the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), notably including the oldest known copies of these texts. They also contain a multitude of extrabiblical texts that shed light on the theological landscape of Judaism during this era.\nBeyond their value in verifying the accuracy of subsequent biblical copies, the Dead Sea Scrolls have illuminated the sociopolitical climate of Judea in the years leading up to the Jewish revolt against Rome in AD 66-70. They give us a window into the diverse beliefs and practices within Judaism at this time, including those of a sectarian group often associated with the scrolls, the Essenes.\nControversy and scholarship # The interpretation of the Dead Sea Scrolls is not without controversy. Debates continue over their authors (often proposed to be the Essenes), the nature of the community at Qumran, and the implications of the Scrolls\u0026rsquo; teachings on both Judaism and Christianity.\nScholars have utilized the scrolls to explore the development of the Hebrew Bible and apocalyptic literature, to understand better the context of Jesus\u0026rsquo;s teachings and the early Christian Church, and to learn more about ancient practices such as ritual purity, temple worship, and communal living.\nDespite the wealth of knowledge gleaned from these texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls continue to be carefully studied, with scholars across the world seeking to unlock their full historical, religious, and linguistic significance.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Apocalypse Wiki ‚Ä∫ Dhorme Bible translation Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ra√´lism Wiki ‚Ä∫ Truth External links # Bible | Wikipedia Bible (sacred text) | Britannica Torah | Jewish Encyclopedia Bible | World History Encyclopedia "},{"id":"31","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–í–æ–π–Ω–∞ —ç–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤","description":"–≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã , –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–µ–ª –º–µ–∂–¥—É –¥–≤—É–º—è –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ–±–æ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º–∏ —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è–º–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Å–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã–º, –Ω–æ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–µ–ª –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø–∞. –§—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–∞—è –∏–∑ –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª—é –∏ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞–ª–∏ –ù–æ—é –≤ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞ –≥–∏–±—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—É—é –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—É –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤. –≠—Ç–∞ —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤—è—â–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –∏—Ö —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –≤–æ –≥–ª–∞–≤–µ —Å –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –í–µ—á–Ω—ã—Ö –Ø—Ö–≤–µ. –í–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –≤ –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–∞—é—â–µ–º –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ. –ù–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç, –Ø—Ö–≤–µ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—É–ø—Ä—É–≥–∏ –≤ –∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ–º –∏—Ç–æ–≥–µ –≤—ã—à–ª–∏ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ, –ø—Ä–æ—è–≤–∏–≤ –º–µ—Ä—É –º–∏–ª–æ—Å–µ—Ä–¥–∏—è, –Ø—Ö–≤–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏–ª –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤, –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏–≤ –∏–º –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Ä–æ–¥–Ω—É—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—É.","content":"See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Adamite struggle Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Wiki ‚Ä∫ Leviathan Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpentine rebellion Wiki ‚Ä∫ Yahweh Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Leo External links # Chaos (cosmogony) # Chaoskampf | Wikipedia Theomachy | Wikipedia "},{"id":"32","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%8D%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B0/","title":"–í—Å–µ–º–∏—Ä–Ω–∞—è —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞","description":"–ú–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–µ–∫, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–∫ –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–µ–∫, —Ä–∞–∑–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω, –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—â–∏–π –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Å—è—Ü –µ–≥–æ –∑–æ–¥–∏–∞–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–º. –ù–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –ø—Ä—è–º–æ —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –º—ã –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º –∏–∑ —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∏ –†—ã–± –≤ —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è.","content":"The precessional Great Year is a term is used to describe the approximately 26'000 year cycle of the slow wobble of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis. This cycle of precession affects the position of the stars in the sky and the way that the sun appears to move through the constellations over time.\nIn astrology, the precessional World Ages are often associated with different historical periods and cultural developments, with each Age being seen as having a distinct spiritual or cultural significance. For example, the current World Age is sometimes referred to as the Age of Pisces, and is associated with the rise of Christianity and the development of Western civilization. Wheel of Heaven considers the current World Age to be the Age of Aquarius which started at around the year 1950 of the Common Era.\nIn addition to its astrological significance, the precessional World Age has also been of interest to scholars and scientists who study the history of astronomy and the movements of the Earth and the stars. By studying the effects of precession on the sky, scientists have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the motion of the Earth and the position of the stars, and to reconstruct the history of the sky over thousands of years.\nOverview # The following table shows the last precessional cycle starting with the Age of Aquarius (today) going back 25'920 years.\nBegins in Ends in Zodiacal house Events 1'950 4'110 Age of Aquarius Revelation, Golden Age 210 BC 1'950 Age of Pisces Jesus, multiplication 2'370 BC 210 BC Age of Aries Abraham, Exodus 4'530 BC 2'370 BC Age of Taurus Babel, Sodom \u0026amp; Gomorrah 6'690 BC 4'530 BC Age of Gemini Flood, Noah 8'850 BC 6'690 BC Age of Cancer Garden of Eden, Adam \u0026amp; Eve 11'010 BC 8'850 BC Age of Leo First humans along Elohim 13'170 BC 11'010 BC Age of Virgo Diversity of life 15'330 BC 13'170 BC Age of Libra Astronomy, accomodation 17'490 BC 15'330 BC Age of Scorpio Terraforming and plant life 19'650 BC 17'490 BC Age of Sagittarius Study and analysis 21'810 BC 19'650 BC Age of Capricorn Earth discovered, exploration \u0026hellip; BC 21'810 BC Age of Aquarius Earth barren and void The table of World Ages suggests that human history can be divided into a series of distinct time periods, eras or Ages, each associated with a particular zodiacal house and a range of significant events. The table covers the last precessional cycle starting with the Age of Aquarius, which is the present age, and going back 25,920 years.\nThe Age of Aquarius began around 1950 AD and is associated with a period of revelation and a golden age, which may suggest a new era of enlightenment and innovation. The Age of Pisces, which preceded the present age, lasted from 210 BC to 1950 AD and was marked by significant events such as the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and his fishermen, as well as the demographic multiplication of the human species. The table also suggests a link between the astrological ages and the history of the Elohim or extraterrestrial creators, with the Age of Leo marked by the first humans along with the Elohim.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Month Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Year Wiki ‚Ä∫ Precession External links # Astrological age | Wikipedia "},{"id":"33","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—è","description":"–ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—è ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏—Å—Ü–∏–ø–ª–∏–Ω–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤ —Å–µ–±—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é –º–æ–¥–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—é –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞, –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –µ–≥–æ –î–ù–ö, –¥–ª—è –≤–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫. –û–Ω –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤ —Å–µ–±—è –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥—ã, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ–º—ã–µ –¥–ª—è –º–∞–Ω–∏–ø—É–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≥–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏ –∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–º–∏, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∫ –≤—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞, —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–ª–∏ –º–æ–¥–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—è –≥–µ–Ω–æ–≤ –¥–ª—è –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞. –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—è –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç —É—á–µ–Ω—ã–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≥–µ–Ω—ã –º–µ–∂–¥—É —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–º–∏ –≤–∏–¥–∞–º–∏, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –º–æ–¥–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º—ã (–ì–ú–û) –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å –∂–µ–ª–∞–µ–º—ã–µ —á–µ—Ä—Ç—ã –≤ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º—ã –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Ü–µ–ª–µ–π, –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—è –ø–æ–≤—ã—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —É—Ä–æ–∂–∞–π–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫—É –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–æ–≤.","content":"See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic biology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic genomics External links # Genetic engineering | Wikipedia "},{"id":"34","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8/","title":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏","description":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏, –∏–Ω–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –Ω–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Ä–∞—Å–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–æ—Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏—Ö –∏–ª–∏ —Å–º–µ–Ω—è—é—â–∏—Ö –¥—Ä—É–≥ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–π —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –Ω–µ—Å—É—Ç –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∑–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–æ–ª–≥–æ–≤–µ—á–Ω—ã—Ö, —Å–≤–µ—Ä—Ö—É—Å—Ç–æ–π—á–∏–≤—ã—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–∏ –Ω–µ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–∏ –ª–µ—Ç. . –•–æ—Ç—è —ç—Ç–∏ —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –±—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω—ã –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –∏ —Ç–æ–π –∂–µ —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π, –∞ –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ –±—ã—Ç—å, –∏—Ö –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –æ—Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–º–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏ –ø–æ —Ä—è–¥—É —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Ç–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –ø–∞–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤, —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞–∫ –º–µ–≥–∞–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã, –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ—É–≥–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ –∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤—ã—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ.","content":"Ancient Builders typically refers to the architects, engineers, and skilled workers who created structures, such as buildings, temples, pyramids, and other monumental structures, in ancient civilizations. These ancient builders used a variety of materials and techniques, depending on the resources and technological abilities available to them. They often incorporated elements of sacred geometry, religious beliefs, and cultural symbols into their structures, which were sometimes used for religious or political purposes.\nExamples of ancient builders include the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan temples, the Parthenon in Greece, and the Roman Colosseum, among many others. These ancient builders have had a lasting impact on architecture and engineering, inspiring and influencing later generations of architects, engineers, and builders.\nThe notion of Ancient Builders is usually understood within the realm of an alleged Ancient Builder race. It refers to the idea that a lost or unknown race of highly advanced people existed in the distant past and were responsible for constructing many of the ancient structures and monuments found around the world.\nProponents of this idea argue that these structures, such as pyramids, stone circles, and megaliths, are too complex and sophisticated to have been built by the civilizations that are known to have lived in the areas where they are found. They suggest that this ancient race may have had advanced knowledge of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy, and that they left behind evidence of their existence in the form of these structures.\nMegalithic Structures # Megalithic structures are large, often ancient, monuments or edifices created from sizable stones or boulders. The term ‚Äòmegalithic‚Äô originates from Greek, with \u0026lsquo;mega\u0026rsquo; meaning \u0026rsquo;large\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026rsquo;lithos\u0026rsquo; meaning \u0026lsquo;stone\u0026rsquo;. These structures are found globally, with some of the most famous examples including the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge in England, and the Moai of Easter Island.\nThe builders of megalithic structures used primitive tools and techniques to create them. It\u0026rsquo;s often speculated that these buildings were created using a combination of physical labor, simple machines such as levers and ramps, and possibly even a deep understanding of acoustics and resonance frequencies. The megalithic stones are often fitted together in intricate patterns, which can suggest a level of mathematical and geometrical knowledge beyond what is typically attributed to these ancient societies.\nThese structures often exhibit astonishing precision. For instance, the stones used in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza were cut with such exactness that the gaps between them are often just a few millimeters wide. Similarly, Stonehenge\u0026rsquo;s positioning relates to celestial events like the solstices, indicating advanced knowledge of astronomy.\nHeavy stonework # One of the most baffling aspects of these megalithic sites is the use of extremely heavy stone blocks, often weighing several tons, that were quarried and transported over significant distances, including uphill to mountainous or elevated locations. This conundrum is intensified when considering that the civilizations attributed to these constructions did not have the wheel, iron tools, or any known form of advanced technology that could facilitate such an endeavour.\nFor example, the stones used in the construction of Stonehenge, known as bluestones, were sourced from a quarry over 200 kilometers away, in the Preseli Hills in Wales. Similarly, the massive granite blocks used in the Pyramids of Giza were quarried at Aswan, more than 800 kilometers away.\nIn South America, the fortress of Sacsayhuam√°n in Peru is built from stones weighing up to 200 tons, transported from quarries located several kilometers away, and then lifted and placed at altitudes exceeding 3,000 meters.\nHow these enormous stone blocks were moved, lifted, and meticulously placed remains one of the greatest mysteries of our ancient past. It\u0026rsquo;s these seemingly insurmountable challenges that have given rise to theories suggesting the involvement of an advanced builder race, or the Elohim, as it appears beyond the capacity of our known ancient civilizations to have achieved these feats with the technologies presumed to have been available to them.\nCyclopean masonry # A common characteristic seen in many megalithic sites worldwide is the use of polygonal masonry, where the stones are cut into a variety of polygonal shapes and sizes and fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle. This technique, also known as cyclopean masonry, is a testament to the high level of sophistication and skill possessed by these ancient builders. Remarkably, despite the irregularity of each stone\u0026rsquo;s shape, the stones fit together so precisely that it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to insert even a thin blade between them. Examples of this type of construction can be found globally, from the ancient Greek structures in Argolis to the Andean walls of Cusco and Sacsayhuam√°n in Peru. This architectural style has puzzled historians and engineers, as the technology needed to achieve such precision is typically associated with much more recent times. The consistent presence of polygonal masonry in ancient, geographically diverse sites has fueled speculation about a global, advanced ancient builder race, potentially linked to the extraterrestrial Elohim as the architects of these structures.\nAstronomical alignements # Many megalithic structures showcase a clear intent of aligning to celestial bodies or events, suggesting advanced knowledge of astronomy and the movements of heavenly bodies among the builders. The incorporation of such celestial alignments is seen in monuments across the world, and they often correspond to important astronomical occurrences such as solstices, equinoxes, and the rise or set of particular stars or constellations.\nThe Pyramids of Giza, for instance, are famously aligned with the constellation Orion, with the three pyramids mimicking the layout of Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt. Orion was associated with the Egyptian god Osiris, indicating a cultural as well as astronomical significance.\nIn Europe, the ancient site of Newgrange in Ireland is designed such that during the Winter Solstice, a narrow beam of sunlight illuminates its inner chamber, a phenomenon that requires precise architectural planning and understanding of solar movements.\nSignificant is the recurring reference to the Pleiades and the Zodiac across various cultures and their monuments. The Pleiades, a cluster of stars, were important to numerous ancient cultures worldwide, and many monuments, like the pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, have been found to align with them.\nIn terms of the Zodiac, it\u0026rsquo;s believed that some monuments\u0026rsquo; design incorporates the understanding of the precession of the equinoxes. The precession is a slow shift in Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis that takes about 26,000 years to complete a cycle. This understanding of the precession suggests knowledge of long-term astronomical cycles.\nThese precise alignments and astronomical references embedded in megalithic architecture defy simple explanation and point towards an advanced understanding of the heavens. Some argue that such knowledge might imply the influence or direct involvement of an advanced extraterrestrial race, such as the Elohim, in guiding or inspiring these constructions.\nExamples of megalithic sites # The Giza pyramid complex: The Egyptian pyramids, particularly the three Great Pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the most iconic megalithic structures. The precision in design and the scale of construction have fueled speculation about the builders\u0026rsquo; identity and methods. These pyramids, built as tombs for the pharaohs, align with the Orion constellation, suggesting advanced astronomical knowledge.\nMachu Picchu: The megalithic structures at Machu Picchu, Peru, provide another example of advanced construction techniques. The structures were built from large stone blocks that fit together without the use of mortar, known as ashlar masonry, with such precision that even a blade of grass cannot be inserted between the stones.\nSee the list of megalithic sites for more examples of megalithic constructions.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim known as the Serpent came to hide in the oceans and how the Elohim built bases and residences on top of high mountain peaks:\nFor by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.\n‚Äî Wisdom of Solomon 13: 5.\nSo it is simple to see the truth, recognizing the creators by observing their creations.\nAnd could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is.\n‚Äî Wisdom of Solomon 13: 1.\nTo avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nThe passage suggests that it is easy to recognize the Elohim, the creators by observing their creations, such as monumental architecture, and that the creators built their bases on high mountains and at the bottom of the sea to avoid being disturbed by humans. As time went on, the mountain stations were gradually abandoned in favor of submarine bases.\nIn another passage, Yahweh mentions how Ezekiel for instance was brought by an Elohimian craft to the base on top of a mountain:\nAnd the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea\u0026hellip;\n‚Äî Ezekiel 11: 23-24.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThis \u0026ldquo;city\u0026rdquo; is one of the Earth bases that the creators used at that time. They were always located on very high mountains so that the creators would not be disturbed by humans. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe interpretation given is that the city referred to is one of the Earth bases that the Elohim, the creators used at the time, and that they were always located on high mountains to avoid being disturbed by humans.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Archaeoastronomy Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of megalithic sites Wiki ‚Ä∫ Precession Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sacred Geometry Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpent External links # "},{"id":"35","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B8/","title":"–ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏","description":"–ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥–æ–≤ –∫ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—é –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∂–∏–≤—ã—Ö –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º —Å –Ω–æ–≤—ã–º–∏ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏—è–º–∏, —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º–∏. –û–Ω –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –º–∞–Ω–∏–ø—É–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–æ–º –∏ —Å–±–æ—Ä–∫—É –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –≤—ã–∑–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –Ω–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏—Ö –≤ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–µ.","content":"See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genetic engineering Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic biology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic genomics External links # "},{"id":"36","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B-%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B0/","title":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∏–ª—ã –°–®–ê","description":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∏–ª—ã –°–®–ê (USSF), —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤ –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä–µ 2019 –≥–æ–¥–∞, —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —à–µ—Å—Ç—ã–º –≤–∏–¥–æ–º –í–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏–ª –°–®–ê. –ö–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø–∞, –æ–Ω –±—ã–ª —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞—é—â–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–∞. –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ USSF –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—ã–º –∏–∑-–∑–∞ –º–µ–Ω—è—é—â–µ–≥–æ—Å—è —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã, –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º –æ—Ç –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç—É—â–µ–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ.

Originally proposed by the Trump administration, the Space Force is a distinct and independent military service under the Department of the Air Force, alongside the U.S. Air Force. This article explores the origins, development, and strategic importance of the USSF, highlighting how President Trump perceived the necessity of military capabilities in space.\nHistory # The idea of a separate military branch dedicated to space isn\u0026rsquo;t new or unique to the Trump administration. In fact, similar concepts have been discussed and deliberated upon within the United States government for several decades. These discussions, however, gained significant traction during Trump\u0026rsquo;s presidency, culminating in the establishment of the USSF.\nThe idea was first publicly announced by President Donald Trump during a speech to service members at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in March 2018. In his address, Trump emphasized the strategic importance of space, referring to it as a \u0026ldquo;war-fighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea.\u0026rdquo;\nFollowing this, in June 2018, Trump directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to initiate the process of establishing the Space Force as a separate branch of the military. After a series of negotiations and legislative actions, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 was signed into law on December 20, 2019, formally establishing the USSF.\nTrump\u0026rsquo;s perception of space military necessity # President Trump\u0026rsquo;s push for a separate military branch dedicated to space can be attributed to several factors. One of the most significant of these is the evolving nature of warfare and global security. The strategic importance of space has been steadily increasing over the years, and as of the early 21st century, it is deemed critical for a nation\u0026rsquo;s defense infrastructure.\nThe reasons behind this shift are multifaceted. Firstly, modern military systems heavily rely on space-based assets for functions such as communications, reconnaissance, navigation, and timing. Disrupting an adversary\u0026rsquo;s access to these capabilities could significantly impact their operational effectiveness. Secondly, technological advancements have resulted in an increase in the types of threats that can be posed in or from space, including kinetic physical, non-kinetic physical, electronic, and cyber threats.\nIn addition, there has been a growing international competition in space. Several nations, including Russia and China, have been actively developing and demonstrating capabilities to deny or degrade space-based assets, further escalating the potential for conflicts in space.\nIn this context, the Trump administration saw the creation of the USSF as a strategic necessity. By creating a separate branch with a distinct culture and dedicated resources, the administration aimed to ensure that the United States can effectively deter threats and, if necessary, defend against them.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Military cover-up of exobiology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ufology External links # United States Space Force | Wikipedia Space Force "},{"id":"37","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD/","title":"–õ–µ–≤–∏–∞—Ñ–∞–Ω","description":"–õ–µ–≤–∏–∞—Ñ–∞–Ω, –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫—É—é —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—é, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—É—é –∫–∞–∫ –ó–º–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã–ª–∞ –ø—Ä—è—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –ø–æ–¥ –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω–∞–º–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Å–µ–±—è –æ—Ç —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤.","content":"The Leviathan is a mythical sea monster mentioned in the Bible, specifically in the book of Job and in the book of Psalms. In the Bible, the Leviathan is described as a powerful and fearsome creature that lives in the sea and is difficult to control.\nThe Leviathan has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. In some interpretations, it is seen as a symbol of chaos and evil, while in others it is viewed as a symbol of the power of God and the natural order of the universe. In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, the Leviathan is often associated with the idea of a great, apocalyptic battle between good and evil, in which God will defeat the monster and restore order to the world.\nIn popular culture, the Leviathan has been depicted in many different ways, often as a giant sea serpent or dragon. It has also been used as a metaphor for various forms of evil, oppression, and tyranny throughout history. The image of the Leviathan continues to hold great cultural and symbolic significance, and it is often referenced in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture.\nEtymology # The term Leviathan originates from the Hebrew word ◊ú÷¥◊ï÷∞◊ô÷∏◊™÷∏◊ü (livyƒÅthƒÅn), which appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in several books, including Job, Psalms, and Isaiah. This term is often used to denote a large sea creature or monster.\nThe root of the word ◊ú÷¥◊ï÷∞◊ô÷∏◊™÷∏◊ü (livyƒÅthƒÅn) is believed to be derived from the Hebrew verb ◊ú◊ï◊î (lƒÅvƒÅh), which means \u0026ldquo;to twist\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to coil\u0026rdquo;, which could be a reference to the creature\u0026rsquo;s serpentine or coiling nature.1\nSea serpent in mythology # The depiction of multi-headed creatures, while unusual in biological terms, often finds representation in mythology and heraldry. Dragons with multiple heads, such as the 8-headed Orochi (Â§ßËõá) and 3-headed Trisiras, emerge frequently across various cultures. Greek mythology also tells of Heracles\u0026rsquo; battles against the 9-headed Lernaean Hydra and the 100-headed Ladon.\nThe number eight in such folklore tends to imply a sense of multiplicity or variation. Furthermore, narratives often feature gods or kings using dragons, particularly multi-headed ones, as their mode of transportation. These tales share common threads with legends across Cambodia, India, Persia, Western Asia, East Africa, and the Mediterranean region.\nThere is a recurring theme across mythologies involving a storm god battling a sea serpent. This concept, termed chaoskampf (German for \u0026ldquo;struggle against chaos\u0026rdquo;)2, symbolizes the ongoing conflict between order and chaos. As these myths develop, the role of the storm god (often the leader of a pantheon) is frequently assumed by culture heroes or figures emblematic of royalty.\nThis motif appears in the battles between Thor and J√∂rmungandr in Norse mythology, Perun and Veles in Slavic mythology, Zeus and Typhon in Greek mythology, and others. A common variant of this theme involves a hero (often of extraordinary birth) confronting a dragon that demands the sacrifice of maidens or princesses. This type of narrative is ubiquitous and classified under the Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther index as ATU 300, \u0026ldquo;The Dragonslayer\u0026rdquo;.3\nApollo vs. Python (Greek): Python was a serpentine dragon in Delphi and was slain by Apollo. This myth symbolizes the establishment of the oracle at Delphi.

Lac Long Quan vs. Ngu Tinh (Vietnamese mythology): The dragon king Lac Long Quan fought the sea monster Ngu Tinh, emphasizing the struggle between civilized and uncivilized worlds. Mankan vs. Kuzury≈´ (Japanese Buddhism): The hero Mankan defeated the nine-headed dragon Kuzury≈´, illustrating the triumph of courage over chaos and danger. Marduk vs. Tiamat (Babylonian): Marduk, the storm god, vanquished the sea serpent Tiamat, a victory of order over chaos that led to the creation of the world. Perun vs. Veles (Slavic): The thunder god Perun battled the serpent god Veles, depicting the perennial conflict between sky and underworld, order and chaos. Quetzalcoatl vs. Cipactli (Aztec mythology): Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, defeated the sea monster Cipactli Ra vs. Apep (Egyptian): Every night, the sun god Ra fought against Apep, the serpent of chaos, to ensure the sun would rise again, symbolizing the perpetual struggle between order and chaos. Saint George vs. the Dragon (Christian): Saint George, a Christian martyr, slayed a dragon to rescue a princess, symbolizing the triumph of Christianity over paganism. Saint Michael vs. Herensuge (Christian-Basque): Saint Michael, an archangel, fought against Herensuge, a seven-headed dragon, representing the battle between good and evil.

Yu the Great vs. Xiangliu or Gong Gong (Chinese): Yu the Great, a legendary ruler, defeated the serpent Xiangliu, illustrating the triumph of leadership and ingenuity over destructive forces. Zeus vs. Typhon (Greek): Zeus, the king of the gods, defeated the monstrous Typhon, signifying the victory of divine order over chaos. Chaoskampf, or the war in space # The term Chaoskampf is derived from the German words \u0026ldquo;chaos\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;kampf\u0026rdquo;, meaning struggle or battle. Chaos on the other hand originates from the Greek word œáŒ¨ŒøœÇ (kh√°os). Similarly to the Ancient Hebrew term ◊™÷π◊î◊ï÷º ◊ï÷∏◊ë÷π◊î◊ï÷º (·πØ≈çh≈´ wƒÅ-·∏á≈çh≈´)4, kh√°os referres not so much to disorder or entropy as it does in the contemporary understanding, but rather to the vast, empty space that existed before the creation of the universe.5\nIn ancient Greek cosmogony, Khaos was the primeval state of existence from which the first gods emerged. It represented the gap between heaven and earth, or more accurately, the gap that existed before heaven and earth were separated. This chasm, void, or limitless space is what was embodied by the term \u0026ldquo;Khaos\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen referring to \u0026ldquo;chaoskampf\u0026rdquo; in mythological terms, it is then a reference to the struggle that takes place within this primordial space or void. While it has come to symbolize the battle between order (represented by gods or heroes) and chaos (often embodied by multi-headed serpents or dragons), it could indeed be seen metaphorically as conflict amongst gods in the vast expanse of space.\nThis interpretation provides a different perspective on the concept, especially considering ancient astronaut theories and narratives that describe gods as extraterrestrial beings. In such contexts, the \u0026ldquo;chaoskampf\u0026rdquo; could very well represent real or metaphorical conflicts taking place in the cosmos, amongst beings who traverse or inhabit different worlds.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of exiled Elohim came to hide in the oceans:\nThe creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.\nIn that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\n‚Äî Isaiah 27: 1.\nAt that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.\nThe Leviathan is the group of scientists led by Lucifer, also known as the Serpent, who had been banished at the outset and had hidden themselves in the oceans, and according to Isaiah 27:1, the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans. This suggests a deep-seated conflict among the Elohim, a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Lucifer led the faction, also known as the Serpent, that defied the ruling authority by having transferred technological knowledge to the early human beings known as the Adamites, which resulted in their exile.\nAfter the Great Flood, this Serpentine faction concealed themselves in the oceans. The waters served as a protective shield, providing a sanctuary against their adversaries led by Yahweh. The reference to Isaiah 27:1 metaphorically encapsulates this power dynamic, wherein Yahweh seeks to punish the \u0026lsquo;Serpent in the sea\u0026rsquo;, embodying the Leviathan or the exiled group.\nThe root cause of this cosmic contention was the Serpentine faction\u0026#39;s rebellion, manifested in their act of creating human beings and interbreeding with the Adamites on Earth. This act was perceived as a grave transgression by Yahweh and his allies, who feared that the descendants of these unions could pose a significant threat to their home planet. Consequently, they desired to annihilate the rebel faction, which instigated the unfolding of this Elohimian space conflict.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Comparative mythology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohimian Space Wars Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpentine rebellion Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Gemini External links # Leviathan | Wikipedia Compound of ◊ú÷¥◊ï÷∞◊ô÷∏◊î (livy√°, \u0026ldquo;garland, wreath\u0026rdquo;) and -◊™÷∏÷º◊ü (-tan, agentive suffix), meaning \u0026ldquo;the tortuous one\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;twisting one\u0026rdquo;.

The exact individual who first used it is difficult to determine, as it emerged out of the academic tradition of German philology and mythology studies during this period. It is associated with scholars such as Hermann Gunkel, Heinrich Zimmer, and Walter Burkert, who contributed to the study of mythological patterns across different cultures. They applied the term to a variety of mythological narratives, drawing parallels between them and highlighting the common theme of a struggle between order and chaos. It is thought that the motif of Chaoskampf originated in the ancient Near East and later transmitted into the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, potentially starting with the Proto-Indo-European religion. The earliest known examples come from ancient Sumer and Babylon, with the conflict between the storm god and the sea serpent, such as the Babylonian myth of Marduk and Tiamat, and the Hittite myth of Tarhunt and Illuyanka.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther classification system is a system used by folklorists to categorize and classify folktales from around the world. It was first developed by Antti Aarne in the early 20th century, later revised by Stith Thompson, and most recently updated by Hans-J√∂rg Uther. The system groups folktales based on similar plot patterns and themes, and assigns each type a number for easy reference. ATU 300, or \u0026ldquo;The Dragonslayer\u0026rdquo;, refers to a type of folktale where the hero, often of extraordinary or mysterious birth, must face and overcome a dragon or a similarly dangerous beast. This beast often requires regular sacrifices, usually maidens or princesses, and the hero must find a way to slay the creature and end the sacrifices. Examples of this tale type can be found in many cultures and mythologies, and include famous tales such as Saint George and the Dragon, Siegfried and the dragon Fafnir from the Nibelungenlied, and the tale of Beowulf and the dragon in the Old English epic Beowulf. The tales can vary widely in detail, but the central theme of a hero overcoming a dangerous beast remains consistent.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOn a side note, \u0026ldquo;Tohu wa-bohu\u0026rdquo; is a Biblical Hebrew term that appears in the creation narrative in Genesis (Genesis 1:2). It is used to describe the state of the Earth (\u0026lsquo;aretz) just before light was created in Genesis 1:3. The word \u0026ldquo;Tohu\u0026rdquo; (◊™◊ï◊î◊ï) is understood to mean \u0026lsquo;desolation,\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;nothingness,\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness,\u0026rsquo; while \u0026ldquo;Bohu\u0026rdquo; (◊ë◊ï◊î◊ï) signifies \u0026lsquo;void\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness.\u0026rsquo; Therefore, the combined phrase \u0026ldquo;Tohu wa-bohu\u0026rdquo; conveys a sense of absolute emptiness, void, or a state of nothingness, a concept that mirrors the Greek word \u0026ldquo;khaos\u0026rdquo; (œáŒ¨ŒøœÇ) which also denotes a \u0026lsquo;vast void\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;emptiness.\u0026rsquo; Thus, both terms, although from different languages and cultural contexts, reflect similar concepts of primordial emptiness or void, a state of formless existence preceding creation, something that we call today \u0026ldquo;outer space\u0026rdquo;.

For example, a eukaryotic cell exhibits a higher degree of gesticulations in a given period of time relative to its body size compared to an ant, which, in turn, generates more kinetic activity than an elephant.\nThis law holds true at all levels of existence, from the smallest living organisms to the largest celestial bodies, and has profound consequences for understanding the behavior of the universe as a whole. For instance, a planet that is smaller than a galaxy would be expected to have a higher degree of motion due to its smaller mass, and would thus complete its revolutions in a shorter period of time. Similarly, a galaxy that is smaller than a supercluster would have a higher degree of motion relative to its size, and would complete its rotations in a shorter period of time.\nThis universal law implies that everything in the universe is interconnected and operates in harmony, with each level of existence influencing and affected by every other level.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Chapter 2 \u0026ldquo;Neither God Nor Soul\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh says the following about the perception of time:\nYou must fully understand that everything is in everything. At this moment in an atom of your arm, millions of worlds are being born and others are dying, believing or not believing in a \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; and a soul, and when a millennium has gone by for you, the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step.\nTime is, in fact, inversely proportional to the mass, or rather to the level of the form of life. But everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\nThe Earth is alive like all the planets, and for the small growth that is humanity, it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass, which prevents you from perceiving its palpitations. Nor could one of our red blood cells, or better still, one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms, with its peers, a living being.\nThe passage explains that everything in the universe is interconnected, and that there are many worlds being born and dying within an atom in your arm at this very moment. Time is inversely proportional to the mass or level of form of life, and everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and small. The Earth is alive like all planets, but humanity finds it difficult to perceive this because of the time lag caused by the enormous difference in mass. The passage concludes by stating that one red blood cell or atom in our body couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine that it forms part of a larger living being.\nOur take # If time is inversely proportional to the mass or level of form of life, then it means that time passes differently for different beings or entities in the universe. For example, a being with a larger mass or a higher level of form of life would experience time passing more slowly than a being with a smaller mass or a lower level of form of life.\nThis has interesting implications for our understanding of time and the universe as a whole. It suggests that time is not a fixed and uniform concept, but rather varies depending on the observer. It also implies that there may be beings or entities in the universe that experience time very differently from us, which could have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of the universe and the possibilities for life beyond our own planet.\nAdditionally, the idea that everything is in everything implies a deep interconnectivity and interdependence between all things in the universe. This means that everything we do and every decision we make can have far-reaching consequences that affect the entire universe, whether we are aware of it or not. It also suggests that there is a fundamental unity underlying all of existence, which can be a source of wonder and inspiration for those who contemplate it.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Infinity "},{"id":"39","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%8F/","title":"–ü–∞–Ω–≥–µ—è","description":"–ü–∞–Ω–≥–µ—è, –¥–æ–ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø–Ω—ã–π —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä–∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –±—ã–ª —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω –∏–∑ –º–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –¥–Ω–∞ –≤—Å–µ–π –ó–µ–º–ª–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏ –≤—Å–∫–æ—Ä–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –∫–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–±—ã–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—É –ó–µ–º–ª—è –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∏ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –µ–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ.","content":"Pangea is a scientific theory that suggests that all of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents were once joined together into a single supercontinent. This supercontinent is believed to have existed between about 300 million and 200 million years ago, before breaking apart and eventually forming the continents as they are known today.\nAccording to the theory of plate tectonics, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents are moving and shifting over time, driven by the movement of large plates that make up the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust. The idea of Pangea suggests that at one point in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s history, these plates collided and merged to form a single, massive landmass.\nThe exact shape and configuration of Pangea is not well understood, but it is believed to have been a unique and sprawling landmass that covered much of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. The exact location of the continents within Pangea is also a matter of scientific speculation, but it is believed that the continents were situated differently from how they are today.\nIn terms of its appearance, Pangea would have been a vastly different landscape from what is seen today, with unique flora and fauna, and a different geography and climate. It is also believed that the arrangement of landmasses within Pangea would have had a major impact on the evolution of life on Earth, leading to the development of many of the species that exist today.\nOverall, Pangea is a fascinating scientific theory that offers a glimpse into the Earth\u0026rsquo;s geological history and provides a unique perspective on the formation and movement of the planet\u0026rsquo;s continents.\nEtymology # The name pangaea is neologism of modern times and does not come from a line of the Tradition. It is derived from Ancient Greek pan (œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ) and Gaea (ŒìŒ±·øñŒ±), meaning the whole earth.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh explains how during the third day of creation a aritfical supercontinent was terraformed:\nSo then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent. Originally there was on Earth only one continent, and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents, which have drifted apart over many years, used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass.\nThe text describes how the Elohim created a continent on the third day of creation by raising matter from the bottom of the seas and piling it up into one place through explosions, and suggests that originally there was only one continent on Earth which has since the impact of the Great Flood drifted apart into different land masses.\nThe following is said about the Great Flood:\nWhen the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe Pangea continent drifted away after a catastrophic explosion that provoked the Great Flood, and the exiled creators asked Noah to build a spaceship to safequard all life\u0026rsquo;s genetic code to orbit the Earth during the cataclysm. When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth, and the continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, destroying all life on its surface.\nSee also #

One way to interpret religion is as a relationship between humanity and its creator or divine force. This interpretation views religion as a means of establishing a connection between humans and the divine, and of understanding and communicating with the ultimate reality or power that governs the universe.\nIn this context, religion provides a framework for understanding the world and one\u0026rsquo;s place within it, as well as a set of beliefs and practices that guide individuals in their quest for meaning, purpose, and a sense of connection to something greater than themselves. Religion also often involves the worship of a deity or deities, the study of sacred texts, and the performance of rituals and other practices that are believed to bring the faithful closer to their deity.\nFor many religious individuals, their faith and relationship with the divine is an important aspect of their daily lives, shaping their values, beliefs, and actions. For others, religion is a source of comfort and solace, providing guidance and support during times of hardship and uncertainty. Still others may see religion as a means of connecting with a community of like-minded individuals who share similar beliefs and practices.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the third book, Let Us Welcome The Extra-Terrestrials, the following is said about religion:\nReligion from the Latin religio means ‚Äúthat which links‚Äù or ‚Äúthe tie‚Äù, which unites the creators to their creation.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of prophets and religions External links # Religion | Wikipedia Religion | Britannica "},{"id":"43","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–†–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞ —ç–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤","description":"–í–Ω–µ—Å–æ–ª–Ω–µ—á–Ω–∞—è –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞–µ–º–∞—è –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞, –æ—Ç–∫—É–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–æ–¥ –∏–ª–∏, –ø–æ –∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ–π –º–µ—Ä–µ, –µ–≥–æ —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è. –≠—Ç–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ –≤ 1 —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–º –≥–æ–¥—É –æ—Ç –ó–µ–º–ª–∏ –∏, —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ, –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –≤ –≥–∞–ª–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ –ú–ª–µ—á–Ω—ã–π –ü—É—Ç—å.","content":"In Ra√´lism üîØ # In Chapter 3 \u0026ldquo;Watching Over the Chosen People\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh mentions the following:\nThe creators came from a planet very far away from the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit.\nIn them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.\n‚Äî Psalms 19: 4.\nIn Mormonism # According to the Book of Abraham, Kolob is the heavenly body nearest to the Throne of God. Kolob can therefore be understood either as a star or a planet. If the Throne of God can be understood as the Elohimian home planet, the heavenly body the closest to this planet would be its home star, which in turn would imply that Kolob is indeed a star around which the Elohimian home planet is orbiting around.\nJohn Tvedtnes proposes in his 2005 essay titled \u0026ldquo;Authentic Ancient Names and Words in the Book of Abraham and Related Kirtland Egyptian Papers\u0026rdquo; 1 that there word Kolob can in a Semitic etymological reading be interpreted as a derivate of the Hebrew root KLB (formerly pronounced as \u0026lsquo;kalb\u0026rsquo;)2 which simply means \u0026lsquo;dog\u0026rsquo;. In astronimical terms, the symbol of dog represents Sirius, also known as the \u0026lsquo;dog star\u0026rsquo;. The name \u0026lsquo;Dog Star\u0026rsquo; for Sirius comes from its prominence in the constellation Canis Major, which means \u0026ldquo;Greater Dog\u0026rdquo; in Latin. In some cultures, its heliacal rising (its first appearance in the dawn sky before sunrise) also coincides with the hottest part of summer, hence the term \u0026ldquo;dog days of summer.\u0026rdquo; Sirius also happens to be the brightest star in the night sky.\nIf Kolob can be understood as Sirius and Kolob is the \u0026ldquo;heavenly body nearest to the Throne of God\u0026rdquo;, the implication would be that Sirius is the center of the Elohimian solar system where they inhabit one of its planets, the \u0026ldquo;Throne of God\u0026rdquo; so to speak. It is also noteworthy here that Sirius is a binary star, meaning the bigger star Sirius A orbits around and with its sister star Sirius B, a much smaller faint white dwarf.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Astrobiology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim External links # Kolob | Wikipedia Sirius | Wikipedia John Tvedtnes has done significant research into the Book of Abraham, which is a work of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism) scripture that the church\u0026rsquo;s founder, Joseph Smith, claimed to have translated from Egyptian papyri.

It involves the application of engineering principles to design and construct biological systems or components with novel functions. Synthetic biology encompasses the design and engineering of genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, proteins, and other biological modules to create new organisms or modify existing ones. It integrates various disciplines such as biology, genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to create synthetic biological systems that can perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits.\nSynthetic genomics: Synthetic genomics primarily focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes. It involves the creation of artificial DNA sequences that mimic or differ from existing natural genomes. Synthetic genomics often aims to understand the minimal set of genes necessary for a living organism\u0026rsquo;s functioning and can involve the creation of synthetic chromosomes or even entire synthetic genomes. It is a branch of genetic engineering that deals specifically with the construction of genetic material.\nSynthetic genomics focuses on the creation of artificial genomes or large segments of genomes, while synthetic biology encompasses a wider range of activities, including the design and construction of genetic circuits, proteins, and other biological components, to create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic genomics can be considered a subset of synthetic biology that specifically deals with the construction of genetic material.\nProtein engineering # Protein engineering is a sub-discipline of synthetic biology that involves the design and construction of new proteins or the modification of existing proteins to create desired properties or functions. This field emerged from the understanding that proteins, as the primary functional units of cellular processes, hold enormous potential in various areas including therapeutics, industrial processes, and new materials. The process of protein engineering entails understanding the intricate relationship between a protein\u0026rsquo;s amino acid sequence, its three-dimensional structure, and its function.\nProtein engineering is at the heart of synthetic biology, because proteins often serve as the functional units that carry out the tasks necessary for a synthetic biological system. Proteins can be engineered to function as enzymes, signal transducers, or structural elements, among other roles. By engineering these proteins, scientists can custom-build biological systems to carry out specific tasks, creating new opportunities for biotechnology.\nThere are two primary methods used in protein engineering: rational design and directed evolution.\nRational design # Rational design involves the use of computational methods and deep understanding of protein structure and function to predict changes that could enhance or modify protein function. This method requires a detailed knowledge of the protein\u0026rsquo;s structure and biochemistry.\nBioinformatic tools, molecular modeling software, and protein databases are often used to create in silico models of protein structures. These models help scientists predict the effects of specific amino acid changes. Once a desired change is identified, genetic engineering techniques are used to alter the DNA sequence encoding the protein, thus producing the engineered protein.\nDirected evolution # In contrast to rational design, directed evolution is an iterative process that emulates natural evolution at a high speed. This method does not require prior understanding of the protein\u0026rsquo;s structure or detailed mechanistic insight into its function.\nDirected evolution involves the generation of a large library of protein variants, typically through random mutagenesis of the DNA sequence that encodes for the protein. This library is then subjected to a screening or selection process, wherein protein variants that exhibit the desired trait or function are isolated. The selected proteins are then used as the starting point for another round of mutation and selection, thus iteratively evolving the protein towards a desired function.\nDirected evolution has been extremely successful in engineering proteins with properties that could not have been predicted with rational design alone. It is now a widely used method for protein engineering, and its conceptual breakthrough and impact on protein engineering were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018.\nArtifical gene synthesis # Artificial gene synthesis, also known simply as gene synthesis, refers to the process by which scientists construct genetic material de novo, or from scratch. This process enables the creation of DNA sequences that might be difficult or impossible to generate through traditional molecular cloning or PCR amplification techniques.\nThe process of gene synthesis begins with the design of the desired DNA sequence. This sequence is often designed in silico, using bioinformatic tools to optimize the sequence for the desired expression system and to eliminate potential issues such as unwanted secondary structures or sequence motifs that could hinder the desired function.\nOnce the sequence is designed, it is synthesized in the lab using chemical methods. The method most commonly used for gene synthesis is the phosphoramidite method, in which individual nucleotides are added to a growing DNA chain in a stepwise fashion. This process starts from the 3\u0026rsquo; end of the DNA and proceeds to the 5\u0026rsquo; end, which is the opposite of the direction of DNA synthesis in living organisms.\nAfter the synthesis of individual DNA fragments, these fragments are assembled into a full-length gene. This is often done using methods such as Gibson assembly, in which overlapping ends of the DNA fragments are joined together by an enzyme that simultaneously removes the overlap and seals the DNA backbone.\nThe resulting synthetic gene can then be inserted into a plasmid or other vector for further use, such as transformation into a host organism or incorporation into a larger piece of synthetic DNA.\nDe novo synthesis # The term \u0026ldquo;de novo\u0026rdquo; is Latin for \u0026ldquo;from the new,\u0026rdquo; and in the context of gene synthesis, it means creating a DNA sequence from scratch rather than using existing DNA as a template. De novo gene synthesis allows for the creation of DNA sequences that do not exist in nature or have been significantly altered from a natural template. This enables the design of completely new genes with desired properties, a capability that is central to the field of synthetic biology.\nIn Ra√´lism # In the Age of Scorpio, the Third Day of Creation, Yahweh says the following about what happened:\nLet the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth. Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. [‚Ä¶]\nIn the Ra√´lian canon, the quoted passage from Genesis describes an act of creation through synthetic biology, in the context of the narrative provided. It seems to depict the engineering of vegetation on Earth, a feat supposedly accomplished by the Elohim.\n\u0026ldquo;Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth,\u0026rdquo; a verse from Genesis, describes the creation of vegetation. In the context of the Ra√´lian narrative, this is interpreted not as a divine act, but as a deliberate, scientific endeavor undertaken by the Elohim.\nThe second paragraph appears to describe this process in more detail. \u0026ldquo;In this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants.\u0026rdquo; This is an account of synthetic biology on a grand scale, where the Elohim are said to have created cells - the fundamental units of life - from simple chemicals. The statement reflects the aspirations of synthetic biology to create life from non-living components.\nThe passage further states that \u0026ldquo;All their efforts were aimed at reproduction. The few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own.\u0026rdquo; This highlights a critical goal of synthetic biology: to create not just individual organisms, but self-sustaining systems. For synthetic life to be viable, it must be capable of reproduction, of sustaining itself beyond the initial act of creation. This ability for independent reproduction is a defining characteristic of life, and its replication in a synthetic context represents a significant achievement.\nOutlook # Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. By merging the principles of engineering, biology, and computer science, it is pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in biological systems.\nThe creation of entirely new forms of life, as suggested in the narrative with the Elohim, lies within the realm of synthetic biology\u0026rsquo;s future potential. Today, synthetic biology is most commonly applied in the redesign of existing biological systems, for instance, by engineering bacteria to produce biofuels, or yeast to generate medicines. However, the long-term vision of many synthetic biologists extends to creating entirely new forms of life that do not exist in nature.\nThe key to this is a detailed understanding and control over the genetic material that governs life: DNA. By reading and writing DNA sequences, scientists can control the function of cells and organisms. This is where artificial gene synthesis and particularly de novo synthesis come in. As mentioned, de novo synthesis refers to the ability to create DNA sequences from scratch, without using existing DNA as a template. This allows for the design and creation of entirely new genes, and ultimately new organisms, with desired properties.\nMoreover, the creation of synthetic genomes, such as the minimal bacterial genome created by the J. Craig Venter Institute, represents a significant step towards the creation of entirely new life forms. A synthetic genome could, in theory, be designed and synthesized to encode the functions for a completely novel organism.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that creating a new life form is not just about creating new DNA sequences. Other biological components like proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and the intricate mechanisms of cellular machinery all play critical roles in the functioning of a life form.\nTherefore, while synthetic biology provides the tools and framework that could make the creation of new life forms possible, we are still at the early stages of this ambitious endeavor. The ethical, societal, and environmental considerations of such advancements are also subjects of ongoing and critical debate.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic genomics External links # Synthetic biology | Wikipedia "},{"id":"45","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –º–µ–≥–∞–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤","description":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –º–µ–≥–∞–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –û–±—à–∏—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ—á–µ–Ω—å –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ–≥–∞–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∏–ª–∏ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ —è—Å–Ω–æ –¥–µ–º–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç –æ—Ç–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–∫–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è.","content":"Megalithic sites are large, ancient structures constructed from massive stone blocks that were often used for religious or ceremonial purposes. These structures date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, and are found in various parts of the world.\nOne of the most famous megalithic sites is the Baalbek temple complex, located in modern-day Lebanon. The complex features a massive stone platform and three enormous stone blocks, known as the Trilithon, which weigh an estimated 800 tons each. The stones were transported from a quarry several miles away, and their precise placement and alignment is a testament to the advanced engineering and construction techniques of the ancient world.\nAnother well-known megalithic site is the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, which includes the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, and other smaller pyramids and tombs. The Great Pyramid is one of the largest megalithic structures in the world, consisting of more than 2 million stone blocks, some weighing as much as 80 tons. The precision with which the stones were cut, moved, and placed has led to much speculation about the methods and tools used by the ancient Egyptians.\nThe Gunung Padang site in Indonesia is another megalithic site that has gained attention in recent years. It consists of several layers of stone terraces and structures, some of which may date back to 20,000 years ago. The site has been the subject of extensive archaeological research, with some theories suggesting that it was a site of astronomical observation and/or energy harnessing.\nMachu Picchu, the famous Incan city in Peru, is also considered a megalithic site due to its impressive stonework and complex layout. The city features numerous temples, palaces, and terraces, all constructed from massive stone blocks that were cut and shaped with great precision. The city was likely built as a royal estate for the Incan emperor Pachacuti, and its location on a mountaintop is thought to have had significant symbolic and ceremonial importance.\nOverall, megalithic sites offer a glimpse into the ancient world and the advanced engineering and construction techniques that were used to create these impressive structures. Their massive stone blocks, intricate alignments, and precise shapes continue to inspire curiosity and awe, and their study can help shed light on the cultural, religious, and technological practices of ancient civilizations.\nList of megalithic sites # The following table lists an extensive enumeration of known megalithic sites:\nSite name Location Excavation status Archaeoastronomical alignment(s) Baalbek temple complex Beqaa Valley, Libanon Giza pyramid complex Near the city of Giza, Egypt G√∂bekli Tepe Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey Gunung Padang Karyamukti, West Java, Indonesia Macchu Picchu Eastern Cordillera, Peru Megalithic temples of Malta Malta Petra Jabal Al-Madbah, Jordan Puma Punku Tiwanaku near La Paz, Bolivia Stonehenge Wiltshire, England Tlachihualtepetl Cholula, Puebla, Mexico See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Builders Wiki ‚Ä∫ Archaeoastronomy Read more # Graham Hancock\u0026#39;s Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth\u0026#39;s Lost Civilization External links # Megalith | Wikipedia "},{"id":"46","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85-%D1%87%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9/","title":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ —ç–∫–∑–µ–≥–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π","description":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ —ç–∫–∑–µ–≥–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π. –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—Å—ã–ª–æ–∫, –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç—ã—Ö ¬´–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–æ–º –Ω–µ–±–µ—Å¬ª, —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç —Ä—è–¥ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö, –º–∏—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–ª–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –Ω–µ–æ—ç–≤–≥–µ–º–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–∫–∑–µ–≥–µ–∑—ã. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–π.","content":"List of exegetic readings # The following table shows the majority of words that can be read with a neo-euhemeristic exegesis.\nWord Exegesis Source Age of Apocalypse The time of revelation where what has been conceiled is going to reveal itself.

Its intended purpose is to serve as a starting point for a scientific discussion about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the likelihood of making contact with such civilizations.\nHowever, the equation is highly speculative and based on a number of assumptions and unknown variables, so its usefulness in determining a definitive answer to the question of extraterrestrial life is limited. Nevertheless, it provides a framework for considering the factors that may influence the existence and detection of extraterrestrial civilizations, and it has inspired further research and discussion on the subject.\nIn an interview, Drake says the following about the purpose of the equation as a thought experiment:\nThe importance of the Drake Equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation. It was written not for purposes of quantification at all, but rather as the agenda for the world\u0026rsquo;s first SETI meeting, in Green Bank WV in 1961. It was quite useful for its intended application, which was to summarize all the various factors which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other life.\nDr. Frank Drake (from Ask Dr. SETI | Chapter 3: Philosophy)\nIn the same chapter, Drake goes on to say the following about the equation being a mirror of our ignorance about life in the universe:\nFor the record, I consider the Drake Equation to be a marvelous tool for quantifying our ignorance.\nThe Drake Equation is meant to be a way of considering all the factors that might affect the existence and detection of extraterrestrial civilizations, and to provide a rough estimate of the number of civilizations that might exist. However, due to the lack of data on many of the variables, the answer is highly uncertain.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Astrobiology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sendy\u0026#39;s conditions of coherence External links # Drake equation | Wikipedia Drake equation (astronomy) | Britannica Drake Equation | SETI Institute "},{"id":"48","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BC/","title":"–≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º","description":"–≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º (–∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç: ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù, 'ƒìloh√Æm) - –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ Eloha (–∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç: ◊ê÷±◊ú◊ï÷π◊î÷∑÷º), –±—É–∫–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç –ú–æ–≥—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ, –∏–ª–∏, –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–æ–º —Å–º—ã—Å–ª–µ, –¢–µ, —á—Ç–æ —Å–≤–µ—Ä—Ö—É, –ù–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω—ã–µ. –≠—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ, –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º –±–æ–≥–∞–º, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Å–∞–º–∏ —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π, —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ–π –∫ –º–µ–∂–∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω—ã–º –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è–º, —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç –∏ —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ–∑—É –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏.","content":"–¢–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º (–∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç: ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù, \u0026lsquo;ƒìloh√Æm) - —ç—Ç–æ –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–æ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ –í–µ—Ç—Ö–æ–º –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ç–µ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏ –∏ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ë–æ–≥. –≠—Ç–æ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ, –∏ –µ–≥–æ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤—ã–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–±–∞—Ç–æ–≤ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—á–µ–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –µ–≥–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è.\n–í —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–º –∏—É–¥–∞–∏–∑–º–µ –∏ —Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–ª—è –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è –ë–æ–≥–∞ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ –≤–µ–ª–∏—á–∏—è, –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–æ —Ç–æ–º—É, –∫–∞–∫ –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª—å –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ —Å–µ–±–µ —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ \u0026ldquo;–º—ã\u0026rdquo;. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–µ —É—á–µ–Ω—ã–µ –∏ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç –∫ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ \u0026ldquo;–≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º\u0026rdquo;

He worked for over a decade as a translator for the Catholic Church at the Vatican, where he translated ancient Hebrew and Greek texts. According to Biglino, his work as a translator has given him access to ancient, uncensored versions of the Bible, which he claims have been altered over time.\nIn his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Ideas About The Bible, he says the following about how the name of the Biblical God is a plural and can be translated as the \u0026ldquo;being from above\u0026rdquo;:\nThe concept of ‚Äúspace‚Äù must be considered as the foundation of everything that has to do with the divine: the Sumerian term for deities is DINGIR, which actually refers to the meaning of ‚Äúcelestial apparition‚Äù highlighting its brightness and shine and then recalling the lords\u0026rsquo; flying machines, which were bright and glittering. Their ideogram symbolized a star and represented a ‚Äúbeing from above‚Äù.\nWe immediately note that this is exactly the same meaning as the biblical term ELOH√åM, ‚Äúthe lords from above‚Äù: term that is usually ‚Äì but wrongly! ‚Äì translated using the singular form to keep the concept of God\u0026rsquo;s oneness.\nLater on, in the same book, he diligently translates the early Genesis passages as follows:\nAnd the Eloh√¨m said: let us make man with image of us and in our liking\nBut the editor of the story seems to feel the need to emphasize something that the reader must absolutely understand: there must be no doubt whatsoever because certainly this is an extraordinary event, and soon you\u0026rsquo;ll understand why.\nIn the next verse (1:27), indeed, it seems he wants to make it clear:\nAnd the Eloh√¨m made man with his image. With image of Eloh√¨m he made. [He] made them male and female\nIn short, the author wants to tell us that the Eloh√¨m (Semitic plural term for the ‚Äúlords from above‚Äù) made man by using their ‚Äútsel√®m‚Äù ( ◊¶÷∂◊ú÷∂◊ù). But what is tsel√®m (◊¶÷∂◊ú÷∂◊ù)? And was this particular so important to point it out twice?\nBefore seeing the deeper meaning of this Semitic root, we note that the Bible tells us how the Eloh√¨ms took this decision and said ‚Äúlet\u0026rsquo;s do‚Äù, using a Hebrew verbal form that is called ‚Äúcohortative mood‚Äù: a form that contains the value of an exhortation, an invitation to do, a solicitation.\nIn this ‚Äúcohortative mood‚Äù we can see a kind of summary of several discussions, hypothesis and suggestions that Enki must have given to his team in order to find a solution to the problems we have listed in the previous chapter.\nThus, using the ‚Äúcoortative mood‚Äù Genesis says: ¬´Come on, let\u0026rsquo;s work, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed\u0026hellip;¬ª. Moreover, the issue of the term Eloh√¨m - plural - cannot be dismissed too easily. We who try to practice freedom of thought and do not have any monotheistic dogma to defend, can proceed with confidence to consider ‚ÄúThe Eloh√¨m‚Äù as a real plurality of persons.\nAncient exegetes believed that the matter cannot be underestimated, [\u0026hellip;]\nBiglino clearly encourages readers to consider the Eloh√¨m as a real plurality of persons, rather than a singular entity and argues that the name of the Biblical God, Elohim, is a plural that can be translated as \u0026ldquo;the lords from above.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to Paul Anthony Wallis # Paul Anthony Wallis, an Australian author on the subject of re-interpreting the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, translates Elohim as the \u0026ldquo;Powerful Ones\u0026rdquo;. This translation for instance explained in his first book on the topic, called Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis Teach That the Human Race Was Created by God or Engineered by ETs, how he uses the Semitic root of the word Elohim:\nIn whichever we may conceive of them, the story invites us to recognize a power well beyond anything we are familiar with. To understate it, they are clearly different to us! For simplicity, I will stick to the root meaning of the word ‚Äúelohim‚Äù and refer to these entities as the ‚ÄúPowerful Ones‚Äù.\nWallis, an educated Biblical scholar, started his journey of translating the Bible in a different way by recognizing and aknowledging the anomalies in the Bible, something he calls the red flags:\nWhen I read this verse in English there‚Äôs no problem. With my interlinear Bible open, the Hebrew text on one side and the Greek of the Septuagint on the other, I can‚Äôt escape a rather big question: Why is this word, elohim, which is translated as God, shaped like a plural noun? How come it‚Äôs a plural if there‚Äôs only one God?\nIn the same book mentioned before, further on, he emphasizes the importance of reading the Bible with a plurality of Gods:\nNow that you‚Äôve eavesdropped on my notes, you‚Äôll understand the wrestle I found myself wrestling. Everything hinged on this enigmatic and anomalous word ‚Äì elohim.\nAs I continued to walk through the pages of Genesis, I could see that every time elohim and Yahweh are equated there is a kind of moral distortion that takes place and the devout reader is forced to excuse ways that appear lower than ours ‚Äì not higher. I began to wonder if the apparent morality of God would lift consistently if we were to re- pluralize our understanding of elohim?\nIn another passage of the same book, he suggest to have been able to settle the argument wether or not Yahweh and Elohim can be equated, a common argument put forward against the plurality of the word Elohim, he writes the following:\nTo settle the matter beyond doubt you just need to locate the car‚Äôs unique fingerprint, the vehicle identification number, etched into the metal. That‚Äôs the smoking gun you would need to find.\nIf the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, and not similar by coincidence, then presumably Yahweh is a separate entity whose self-revelation has been interwoven with the stories of the Powerful Ones. For our smoking gun we need look no further than the book of Joshua 24:14.\nIn this passage Joshua gives a speech to persuade the people of Israel to entrust themselves to the entity who revealed himself to Moses in the desert as Yahweh. Joshua has succeeded Moses as leader following Moses‚Äô death. He addresses the people in these words:\n‚ÄúNow, therefore, follow Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and truth. Put away the elohim (the Powerful Ones) whom your ancestors served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh\u0026hellip; Today make up your minds whom you mean to serve; the Powerful Ones whom your ancestors served beyond the river, or the Powerful Ones of the Amorites in whose country you now live. But as for me and my house we will serve Yahweh.‚Äù\nThe time in Egypt speaks of the Israelites‚Äô time enslaved within a foreign religious culture before Yahweh revealed himself to Moses.\n‚ÄúOn the other side of the river,‚Äù refers to the religious culture of Abraham and Sarah‚Äôs roots in Sumerian Mesopotamia. Joshua 24:2 clarifies this:\n‚ÄúSince a time before memory your ancestors, right up until Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived on the other side of the river and served Powerful Ones (i.e. other (plural) elohim.)\nJoshua calls his people to reject the Egyptian and Sumerian elohim ‚Äì ‚Äútear them off‚Äù is his phrase ‚Äì and give all their allegiance to Yahweh.\nHere is an instance when elohim and Yahweh clearly cannot be equated. Here elohim is a plurality of Powerful Ones whom we are not to worship. They are the Sky People of Abraham‚Äôs Sumerian heritage, whose stories are told in the cuneiform tablets. Joshua calls the people in God‚Äôs name to disregard them, reject them and cut them off!\nFor me this is the smoking gun. Every point of correlation between the Sky People and the Powerful Ones in their respective storylines constitutes another digit in that vehicle identification number. Joshua‚Äôs speech unambiguously connects the two mythologies.\nWallis argues that in order to prove that the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, therefore implying that the God of the Bible is a plural and represent an extraterrestrial civilization, one must locate a smoking gun in the form of evidence, which he finds in the book of Joshua 24:14.\nWhile taking the Sumerian account as a blueprint, Wallis makes the meticulous observation that the Powerful Ones can also be called the Sky People:\nThe Sumerian word for ‚Äúgod‚Äù or ‚Äúgods‚Äù is a glyph that indicates the sky. To get as near to the original associations as we can I will be referencing them as Sky People.\nBasically, Wallis re-interprets the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, which he translates as the ‚ÄúPowerful Ones.‚Äù He emphasizes the importance of reading the Bible with a plurality of Gods and argues that the plurality of the word Elohim can be settled by locating a smoking gun in the form of evidence. Wallis suggests that the evidence can be found in the book of Joshua 24:14, which unambiguously connects the two mythologies and clarifies that the Powerful Ones of the Bible and the Sky People of the cuneiform tablets are the same, and the God of the Bible is a plural and represents an extraterrestrial civilization.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the first book The Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh says the following about the very meaning of Elohim, the alleged name of God in the Biblical scriptures:\nI am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences. So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:\nIn the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 1.\nElohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects.\nLater on, in the same book, Yahweh emphasizes the proper translation of Elohim again:\nElohim in Hebrew literally means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim.\nIn summary, Yahweh explains that Elohim, the alleged name of God in the Bible, means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; in Hebrew and is a plural word, implying that they represent members of an civilization from another world capable of interstellar travel.\nIndividuals # In Ra√´lism, there are a few Elohim invididuals that are known by their names or nominal roles. The most famous ones are named in the Bible with the following denominations:\nYahweh: The president of the Council of the Eternals and main representative of the Elohimian civilization. Lucifer: Leader of a faction among the Elohim that brought the light and knowledge to the first human beings and main advocate for the continuity of the human species. Satan: Leader of a faction among the Elohim that believes nothing good can come from the humans and main antagonist of the continuity of the human species. Summary # Usage # As we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, Elohim seems to refer to an extraterrestrial civilization collectively remembered in the Biblical scriptures. Many proponents of this notion each settle for a variety of terms. In the following table, we would like to summarize what names have been used by these proponents and what they refer to by that name.\nName Meaning Proposed by Anaqiti Those who from heaven to Earth came Mauro Biglino Anunnaki (Sumerian: íÄ≠íÄÄíâ£íàæ) Sky People tbd Celestials People from the Sky Jean Sendy Elohim (Hebrew: ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù) Powerful Ones, Sky People tbd Sky People People from the Sky Jean Sendy, Paul Anthony Wallis Theosites Inhabitants from Theos Jean Sendy Our take # The term Elohim is the plural form of Eloha, which means \u0026ldquo;Celestials\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ones from the sky.\u0026rdquo; It is the name given to the Biblical gods who are believed to be a highly advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel, terraforming planets, and synthesizing life.

Yahweh is considered the personal name of God in Judaism and is the name used most often in the Hebrew Bible. In English, it is often written as \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Jehovah.\u0026rdquo;1\nEtymology # The name Yahweh, represented in Hebrew as ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (YHWH)2, is known as the Tetragrammaton and is one of the names used for God in the Hebrew Bible. Its exact meaning and origin are somewhat uncertain due to ancient Jewish practices of avoiding the pronunciation of the name out of reverence, substituting it instead with \u0026ldquo;Adonai\u0026rdquo; (Lord) or \u0026ldquo;HaShem\u0026rdquo; (The Name).\nThe most common interpretation of Yahweh is that it derives from the Hebrew verb ◊î◊ï◊î (hawah), which means \u0026ldquo;to be\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to become\u0026rdquo;. According to this interpretation, Yahweh could be understood as meaning \u0026ldquo;He Who Is\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He Who Exists\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;He Who Will Be\u0026rdquo;. This interpretation is supported by God\u0026rsquo;s statement to Moses in Exodus 3:14: \u0026ldquo;I am who I am\u0026rdquo;, or in Hebrew, \u0026ldquo;◊ê◊î◊ô◊î ◊ê◊©◊® ◊ê◊î◊ô◊î\u0026rdquo; (Ehyeh asher ehyeh). \u0026ldquo;Ehyeh\u0026rdquo; (◊ê◊î◊ô◊î) is the first person singular imperfect form of the verb \u0026ldquo;to be\u0026rdquo; (◊î◊ô◊î).3 When shifted to the third person form, \u0026ldquo;He Is\u0026rdquo;, the verb could be pronounced as Yahweh, thus lending to the interpretation of Yahweh as \u0026ldquo;He Who Is\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;He Who Exists\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, there are other interpretations and much scholarly debate about the origins and meaning of YHWH, partly due to the lack of vowels in the original Hebrew script and the ancient practice of not pronouncing the name. Some scholars have suggested that the name might be related to a title for a storm god or might have been originally associated with a specific location or shrine.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Ra√´lism, Yahweh is explicitely identified as the president of the Council of the Eternals governing the Elohim‚Äôs planet and therefore an individual of flesh and blood among the Elohimian civilization.\nAccording to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter Meeting the Ancient Prophets, Yahweh himself explains that the Council of the Eternals live in a planet dedicated for that purpose:\nIn my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.\nAmong those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.\nThere are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.\nAlongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals.4\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe passage states that there is a residence on another planet where people from Earth can live due to a scientific secret of eternity based on a single cell. The residence is a large planet where the Council of the Eternals lives, and Yahweh is the president of that council. Currently, there are 8'400 people from Earth living there who have reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite or have contributed to humanity\u0026rsquo;s progress through their discoveries, writings, ways of organizing society, and acts of fraternity, love, or selflessness. Alongside these people, there are 700 members of the Elohim who are part of the Council of the Eternals.\nYahweh, the Eternal # In the first book The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, Ra√´l gets to ask Yahweh a few questions about him and the Elohim in general:\n\u0026lsquo;How old are the oldest ones?\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;The oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;Then your knowledge must be immeasurable?\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;Yes, I have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge, and I will not be able to gain much more. [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rsquo;5\nThe experiment Yahweh is referring to was explained a little earlier on in the same chapter:\n\u0026lsquo;Our body lives on average, ten times longer than yours,\u0026rsquo; he replied.\n\u0026lsquo;Like the first people of the Bible, that is between 750 and 1,200 years. But our mind, our true self, can be truly immortal. I have already explained to you that, starting with any cell of the body, we can re-create the whole person with new living matter. When we are in full possession of our faculties and our brain is at its maximum level of efficiency and knowledge, we surgically remove a tiny sample 108 of the body, which we then preserve. Then, when we really die, we take a cell from this preserved sample and re-create the body in full, just as it had been at the time the sample was taken.\nI say, \u0026ldquo;as it had been at that time\u0026rdquo;, meaning with all its scientific knowledge and, of course, its personality. But in this case, the body is made up of new elements with the potential for another one thousand years of life - and so on eternally. But in order to limit the growth of the population, only geniuses have the right to eternity.\nEverybody on our planet has a cell sample taken at a certain age, hoping that they will be chosen for re-creation after their death. In fact they not only hope for it, they try to earn this resurrection during their life. Once they have died, a grand council of the eternals assembles to decide in a \u0026ldquo;last judgement\u0026rdquo;, who among those who died during the year deserves to live another life. For a period of three lifetimes, the eternal is on probation, and at the end of this time, the council of the eternals reconvenes to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member.\nFrom the moment that one wishes to have a new life, one no longer has the right to have children, although this does not of course prevent love. This explains why the scientists who were members of the council of the eternals wished to create life on other planets. They transferred their procreative instincts onto other planets.\u0026rsquo;6\nYahweh, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old and has lived in twenty-five bodies. He directed the creation of life on Earth and has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge. The Elohim have a technology that allows them to re-create a person\u0026rsquo;s body with new living matter using a tiny sample taken from the body. This technology can create a new body with the potential for another one thousand years of life, and the population is limited by granting eternal life only to geniuses. The council of the eternals decides who among those who have died deserves to live another life, and a grand council of the eternals assembles to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member. Those who wish to have a new life no longer have the right to have children. The scientists who were members of the council of the eternals created life on other planets as a way to transfer their procreative instincts.\nAlpha and Omega # In another passage of the Book, Yahweh explains what was meant by the common saying \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo;:\nJohn, panic-stricken, fell with his face to the ground:\nAnd when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, ‚ÄòFear not; I am the first and the last, and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter. 17\nRevelation 1: 17-20\nWe asked John to get up, and we told him that he must write everything that he had seen, and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings when the time would come. We told him that we were ‚Äúthe first and the last‚Äù, that is to say, the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies to permit them to do so. We explained to him that the one who was speaking had known death, but had been re-created, thanks to the process explained in the first message, which permits us to live eternally through many bodies.7\nYahweh explains the meaning of the common saying \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo; from the Bible\u0026rsquo;s Book of Revelation. Yahweh told John, who was panic-stricken and fell to the ground, to write everything that he had seen and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings in the future. Yahweh claimed to be \u0026ldquo;the first and the last,\u0026rdquo; the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies that permit them to do so. Yahweh explained that the one who was speaking had known death but had been re-created through the process explained in the first message, which allows them to live eternally through many bodies.\nOn another account, Yahweh says the following:\nI, Yahweh, the alpha and the omega, he who was the first one on Earth and also he who will be the last, I am sending this message to all humans of the Earth through the words of my prophet, Ra√´l, to all those humans whom we have created, and whom we have tried to lead towards the Golden Age, and who we love as if they were our own children.8\nIn this passage, Yahweh describes himself as the \u0026ldquo;alpha and the omega,\u0026rdquo; just as he did in the previous passage where he explained the meaning of \u0026ldquo;The First and the Last\u0026rdquo;. Yahweh also explains that he is sending a message to all humans of the Earth through his prophet, Ra√´l, and that they are loved as if they were their own children. The message is directed towards those who have been created by the Elohim and have been guided towards the Golden Age.\nOur take # In traditional Christian theology, \u0026ldquo;the Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is interpreted as a title for God and as a reference to the book of Revelation in the Bible. It is a symbol of God\u0026rsquo;s eternal nature and power over all creation, as God existed before all things and will exist beyond the end of all things. This phrase is also a reference to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, suggesting that God is the beginning and the end of all things. In this sense, the \u0026ldquo;Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is a powerful symbol of God\u0026rsquo;s supreme authority, sovereignty, and divinity, as well as an assurance of God\u0026rsquo;s faithful presence throughout all of human history.\nAs pointed out by Yahweh himself, \u0026ldquo;The Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; is a phrase used in the Book of Revelation that represents the beginning and the end, or the first and the last, suggesting that the Elohim, in particular Yahweh himself as their representative, are quasi immortal. In the context of the Ra√´lian messages, Yahweh describes himself as the Alpha and the Omega, indicating that he was the first on Earth, and he will be the last if men self-destroy. He explains that they have the technology to re-create a person\u0026rsquo;s body with new living matter and that their minds can be immortal, leading to eternal life. This implies that the \u0026ldquo;Alpha and the Omega\u0026rdquo; could be a symbol of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s ability to create and recreate life, as well as their role in guiding humanity towards progress and enlightenment.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ra√´lism External links # Yahweh | Wikipedia Tetragrammaton | Wikipedia Alpha and Omega | Wikipedia Jehovah | Jewish Encyclopedia It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that Yahweh is sometimes anglicized as Jehovah, a rendering that originated from combining the consonants of YHWH with the vowels from Adonai.

Bigliardi provides an overview of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s life and work, including his theories on the origins of humanity, the influence of extraterrestrial beings, and the possible connections between various mythologies and ancient cultures.\nBigliardi argues that while Sendy\u0026rsquo;s ideas are often associated with the contemporary \u0026ldquo;ancient aliens\u0026rdquo; movement, his work is more nuanced and sophisticated than the simplistic and often sensationalist claims of some modern authors. Sendy drew on a wide range of sources, including mythology, ancient texts, and scientific theories, to develop his ideas. He also emphasized the need for critical thinking and careful analysis of evidence, rather than simply accepting or rejecting theories based on preconceived notions.\nOverall, Bigliardi suggests that Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work is an interesting and valuable contribution to the study of esotericism and the search for meaning in human history, and encourages readers to engage with his ideas in a thoughtful and critical manner.\nAbstract # The paper was published in September 2016, focusing on the works and ideologies of Jean Sendy, a French author. It delves into a bibliography of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s works, highlighting titles such as \u0026ldquo;Les cahiers de cours de Mo√Øse,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;La lune cl√© de la Bible,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Nous autres, gens du Moyen Age,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;L‚Äô√®re du Verseau, fin de l‚Äôillusion humaniste.\u0026rdquo;\nJean Sendy proposed various theories and interpretations about ancient civilizations and their interactions with extraterrestrial beings, which he referred to as \u0026ldquo;Theosites.\u0026rdquo; He theorized that certain ancient monuments, like the Pyramids, the archaeological remains in Tihuanaco, Bolivia, and the Temple of Baalbek in Lebanon, might have been constructed using advanced techniques introduced by these extraterrestrial entities.\nCentral to Sendy\u0026rsquo;s narrative is the idea that Theosites visited Earth, imparting their knowledge to humans. This wisdom was preserved as a \u0026ldquo;Tradition\u0026rdquo; by select civilizations, leading to their flourishing. In contrast, those who strayed from this Tradition encountered adversities.\nThe document also touches upon the influences on Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work. It suggests that he might have drawn inspiration from other authors and thinkers, including Matest Mendeleiev Agrest and Alexander Kazantsev, who also ventured into theories about extraterrestrials and ancient human history.\nOn a side note, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s own interpretation of world history, especially the conflict between Nazism and Catholicism, is explored. Having lived through the atrocities of Nazi Germany, these experiences deeply influenced his writings.

The epic, written in cuneiform on clay tablets, dates back to the early 3rd millennium BCE.\nThe story begins with the introduction of Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third human, who is a tyrannical king of Uruk. The gods create Enkidu, a wild man, to challenge Gilgamesh and divert his destructive behavior. After a fierce battle, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become close friends. They undertake a series of adventures, including the slaying of the monstrous guardian, Humbaba, in the Cedar Forest, and killing the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.\nEnkidu\u0026rsquo;s death, a punishment from the gods for these actions, deeply affects Gilgamesh, leading him to embark on a quest for immortality. He seeks Utnapishtim, the only human granted immortality by the gods, hoping to learn his secret. Utnapishtim recounts the Great Flood, a story remarkably similar to the biblical account of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, revealing that the gods decided to bestow immortality upon him as a reward for preserving life on a boat he built.\nGilgamesh\u0026rsquo;s quest ultimately fails when he secures, then loses, a plant that bestows youth. The epic concludes with Gilgamesh accepting his mortality and returning to Uruk, where he finds wisdom in his achievements and the enduring legacy of his rule.\nThe discovery of the Epic of Gilgamesh, among other texts, in the ruins of the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh in the 19th century, was a major event in the field of Assyriology and ancient Near Eastern studies.

Other notable speakers in the film include George Grant, Paul Nelson, Marcus R. Ross, Andrew A. Snelling, Kurt Wise, and Larry Vardiman in the bonus features. The inspiration for the film came after Purifoy\u0026rsquo;s daughter watched the Bill Nye‚ÄìKen Ham debate in 2014, which spurred questions about the creation-evolution controversy‚Äã.\nThe film was released in American theaters on February 23, 2017, and it was shown in 704 theaters.

Created Kinds: It discusses the concept of \u0026ldquo;kinds\u0026rdquo; as described in Genesis, in opposition to the theory of evolution. Fossil Record: The documentary explores the fossil record, arguing that it supports the idea of a global flood rather than gradual geological processes. DNA and Transitional Forms: It examines genetic evidence and the absence (as claimed in the film) of transitional forms in the fossil record. Historic Views on Evolution and Ecosystems: The film addresses historical perspectives on evolution and the complexity of ecosystems. Global Flood and Starlight: It presents arguments for a global flood and discusses astronomical evidence. Tower of Babel and Big Bang: The film covers biblical events like the Tower of Babel and contrasts the Big Bang theory with creationist beliefs. Rock Layers and Genealogies: It examines geological formations and biblical genealogies to argue for a young Earth.

Directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Trevorrow, Derek Connolly, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, the film is set 22 years after the events of the original Jurassic Park and takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off Costa Rica\u0026rsquo;s Pacific Coast.\nIn Jurassic World, the island has been transformed into a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. The story follows the park\u0026rsquo;s operations manager, Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, and a velociraptor trainer, Owen Grady, portrayed by Chris Pratt. The plot thickens when a genetically engineered dinosaur, the Indominus rex, breaks loose and causes chaos across the park. The film explores themes of corporate greed, ethical responsibility in genetic engineering, and humanity\u0026rsquo;s relationship with nature.\nJurassic World was a major box office success, grossing over $1.6 billion worldwide, and received generally positive reviews for its visuals, action sequences, and Pratt\u0026rsquo;s performance. It revived the franchise after a 14-year hiatus and was followed by sequels Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in 2018 and Jurassic World: Dominion in 2022, continuing the story of human encounters with genetically resurrected dinosaurs in a rapidly changing world.\nCommon themes # At the core of both narratives is the theme of genetic engineering and its potential for catastrophic outcomes. Jurassic World vividly portrays the dangers of human hubris in scientific pursuits, particularly in the creation of the genetically modified Indominus rex, which ultimately wreaks havoc. This mirrors the Wheel of Heaven‚Äôs emphasis on the repercussions of humans playing God through genetic manipulation, echoing the cautionary tale of unchecked scientific progress.\nAnother significant thematic strand is the creation and manipulation of new life forms. The Wheel of Heaven website delves into the concept of visionary scientists pushing the boundaries of genetics to create new species, a scenario that unfolds tragically in \u0026ldquo;Jurassic World.\u0026rdquo; The film\u0026rsquo;s narrative illustrates the unpredictable and often perilous consequences of such endeavors, resonating with the website\u0026rsquo;s skepticism towards the unchecked creation of life.\nAdditionally, the intersection of genetic engineering with other advanced technologies, such as space exploration, forms a compelling thematic link. Jurassic World subtly hints at this through the dialogue about the profitability of space programs, suggesting a future where various fields of advanced technology evolve in tandem. This notion aligns with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s broader perspective on the parallel development of genetic engineering and space travel, underscoring the multifaceted nature of scientific advancement.\nThematic scenes from the movie # The following excerpts from Jurassic World, are noteworthy, illustrating the film\u0026rsquo;s depiction of advanced genetic engineering and its concurrent development with space exploration, reflecting key themes in contemporary scientific endeavors.\n\u0026ldquo;She was DESIGNED.\u0026rdquo; # In this pivotal scene from Jurassic World, the dialogue between Claire, Osterly, Drucker, and Dr. Henry Wu encapsulates several central themes that resonate deeply with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration of science, ethics, and the allure of discovery.\nClaire\u0026rsquo;s introduction of the Indominus Rex as the park\u0026rsquo;s first genetically modified hybrid underscores the audacity of human ingenuity in bending natural laws to meet commercial desires. This moment reflects the website\u0026rsquo;s focus on the ethical implications of genetic engineering, where the pursuit of thrills and commercial success overshadows the profound responsibility that comes with creating life.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOSTERLY: We wanna be thrilled.\nCLAIRE: Oh, but don\u0026rsquo;t we all?\n[She slides her finger across the screen and a DNA double helix reacts. Claire steps forward proudly.]\nCLAIRE: May I present you\u0026hellip; the Indominus Rex. Our first genetically modified hybrid.\n[Drucker looks dubious.]\nDRUCKER: How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to\u0026hellip;\n[He struggles with how to put it, and makes awkward \u0026ldquo;doing it\u0026rdquo; motions with his hands.]\nDRUCKER: Y\u0026rsquo;know\u0026hellip;\n[He trails off uncertainly. DR. HENRY WU walks over to the group, smiling.]\nWU: Oh, Indominus wasn\u0026rsquo;t bred. She was DESIGNED. She will be fifty feet long when fully grown. BIGGER than the T. rex.\nCLAIRE: (to the investors) Every time we\u0026rsquo;ve unveiled a new asset, attendance has spiked. Global news coverage. Celebrity visitors. Eyes of the world.\n‚Äî Excerpt from the transcript, chapter \u0026ldquo;Hammond Creation Lab\u0026rdquo;\nDrucker\u0026rsquo;s reaction, mingled with skepticism and curiosity, mirrors our collective bewilderment at the possibilities and dangers of genetic manipulation. His struggle to articulate the process of creating such a creature highlights the often incomprehensible complexity behind such scientific feats, a theme prevalent in the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s narrative.\nDr. Wu\u0026rsquo;s assertion that the Indominus Rex was \u0026ldquo;designed\u0026rdquo; rather than bred is particularly telling. It suggests a shift from traditional notions of natural evolution to a new era where life is engineered to specification. This aligns with the website\u0026rsquo;s thematic exploration of the power and perils of playing God, emphasizing the profound implications of such scientific advancements.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Like the Space program\u0026rdquo; # In this succinct yet impactful scene from Jurassic World, Claire\u0026rsquo;s comparison of the park\u0026rsquo;s need for constant innovation to the space program encapsulates a significant theme that aligns closely with the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s exploration: the simultaneous advancement of life creation technologies and space exploration.\nThe construction crews are on break as Claire and Owen get out of the car. Owen stares up at the towering walls, looking unconvinced and more than a little uneasy.\nCLAIRE We\u0026rsquo;ve been pre-booking tickets for months. The park needs a new attraction every few years in order to reinvigorate the public\u0026rsquo;s interest. Kinda like the space program.\nShe walks over to the flight up steps leading up to the observation tower. Owen follows.\n‚Äî Excerpt from the transcript, chapter \u0026ldquo;Indominus Wrecks\u0026rdquo;\nClaire\u0026rsquo;s reference to pre-booking and the public\u0026rsquo;s craving for new attractions draws a parallel between the creation of genetically engineered dinosaurs and the grandeur of space travel. This dialogue succinctly reflects the Wheel of Heaven\u0026rsquo;s focus on a unique period in human history where the ability to design and resurrect life converges with the meaningful exploration of space. This convergence symbolizes a pivotal moment in human capability, marked by extraordinary technological feats in both biological and astronomical fields.\nThe scene, in its brevity, highlights the critical intersection of these two realms of human achievement, underscoring the profound implications of this dual advancement for our understanding of life, space, and our place in the universe.\nSee more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Preamble Wiki ‚Ä∫ Intelligent Design Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life Engineering External links # Jurassic World Film Transcript | Jurassic Wiki "},{"id":"65","href":"/ru/resources/kosmographia/","title":"Kosmographia ‚Äî The Official Randall Carlson Podcast","description":"\"Kosmographia ‚Äî The Official Randall Carlson Podcast\" is a thought-provoking and in-depth podcast series hosted by Randall Carlson, a renowned geological and architectural theorist, teacher, and scholar.

She contends that the constellations hold a deeper, spiritual meaning that has been obscured by associations with pagan mythology and a lack of understanding of their original intent.\nRolleston argues that the constellations and their names, which are known worldwide and throughout history, point to a common origin both for humanity and these celestial symbols. She suggests that these symbols were used to educate spiritually, connecting the constellations with divine truths and prophetic messages. According to her, these signs were known before the corresponding biblical prophecies were written, thus indicating their ancient origin and divine inspiration.\nRolleston also discusses how the zodiac signs and the twelve tribes of Israel are interconnected, with each tribe represented by a specific constellation. She believes that this connection further solidifies the idea that the constellations are more than mere astronomical figures, but rather, carry a deeper, spiritual message.\nThe book explores how different cultures and civilizations, including the Chinese, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Arabs, Brahmins, Greeks, and Romans, have acknowledged the constellations, attributing their knowledge and understanding to earlier sources, often linked with biblical figures like Noah and Abraham.\nAbout Frances Rolleston # Frances Rolleston (1781-1864) was an English scholar, author, and theologian who is best known for her work on biblical symbolism and typology. She was born into a wealthy family and spent much of her life studying and writing about the Bible and Christian theology.\nRolleston\u0026rsquo;s most significant work is \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth; or, The Constellations,\u0026rdquo; a study of the astrological symbolism of the Bible and the connection between the zodiac and biblical events. The book was published in 1865, a year after her death, and was based on her extensive research and notes.\nIn addition to her work on biblical symbolism, Rolleston was also involved in various philanthropic and social causes, including the education and welfare of women and children. She supported various charitable organizations and was a prominent advocate for women\u0026rsquo;s rights and social justice.\nDespite her contributions to the study of biblical symbolism and theology, Rolleston\u0026rsquo;s work was largely overlooked by contemporary scholars, and her legacy was not fully recognized until many years after her death.

These books, traditionally attributed to Moses, contain the laws and religious teachings of Judaism, including the Ten Commandments and the narrative of the Israelites from the creation of the world to their arrival in the Promised Land.\nThe Nevi\u0026rsquo;im (Prophets): This section is divided into two parts - the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets, which is a single book in the Jewish canon). These books encompass the historical narrative of the Israelites, their moral and prophetic teachings, and their relationship with God.\nThe Ketuvim (Writings): This diverse collection includes poetry, religious hymns, philosophical discourses, and narrative stories. Key books in this section include Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles.\nThe Tanakh forms the theological and ethical foundation of Jewish religious practice. Its teachings guide Jewish law (Halakha), philosophy, and tradition. The Tanakh is also central to Jewish worship and is regularly studied both for its religious and moral teachings and for its cultural and historical significance.\nIn terms of historical context, the Tanakh was compiled over a period of centuries, with scholars generally agreeing that the final form was completed by the 2nd century BCE. The books of the Tanakh were originally written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.\nThe influence of the Tanakh extends far beyond Judaism; its narratives, teachings, and themes have had a profound impact on Western culture and religious thought. The Christian Old Testament is based on the Tanakh, though the order and number of books differ. The Tanakh continues to be a subject of religious and academic study, offering insight into ancient Near Eastern history, culture, and religion.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible Resources ‚Ä∫ Bible of La Pleiade Resources ‚Ä∫ Sefaria External links # Judaica Press Translation of Tanakh with Rashi\u0026#39;s commentary Free online translation of Tanakh and Rashi\u0026#39;s entire commentary "},{"id":"75","href":"/ru/resources/temporary-temples/","title":"Temporary Temples","description":"Temporary Temples serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone intrigued by the mystery and beauty of crop circles, offering a blend of documentation, analysis, and community engagement.","content":"The website Temporary Temples is dedicated to exploring and documenting crop circles, particularly in the UK.

Berlinski, a secular Jew and mathematician, questions the completeness and authority of science in answering profound existential and moral questions.\nBerlinski argues that the science often cited by atheists to debunk religious beliefs actually does not conclusively negate the possibility of a divine existence. He highlights the limitations of scientific theories, especially in fields like quantum mechanics and relativity, in explaining the origins and nature of the universe, and he points out that these theories lack comprehensive empirical verifiability. Berlinski expresses skepticism towards Darwinian evolutionary theory, questioning its ability to fully explain the complexity of life and the emergence of human consciousness.\nMoreover, Berlinski challenges the idea that a secular, rationalist approach can provide a robust foundation for morality. He suggests that objective morality might indeed require a religious underpinning, countering the claim that moral understanding can be achieved purely through rational thought.\nDespite his critiques, Berlinski does not completely dismiss the achievements of Western science. He acknowledges the importance of scientific theories as significant human accomplishments but argues that they fall short in addressing the profound questions traditionally explored by religion.\nControversially, Berlinski\u0026rsquo;s book raises questions about his own religious beliefs. Despite his defense of religious thought, Berlinski himself is not religious, leading to discussions about the sincerity and motivation behind his arguments. His book is seen as a response to the rise of militant atheism and the dismissal of religious belief by prominent thinkers in the scientific community.

This claim is based on various studies, including anthropological and genetic research, which find significant genetic similarities between Jews and Palestinians.\nThe Engagement proposes a single-nation solution, whereby the majority of Palestinians would rejoin the People of Israel, forming one state for one people, without requiring religious conversion. This solution, seen as an alternative to the two-state solution and the idea of a bi-national state, emphasizes the reunification of people with shared roots and aims to redirect energies towards rehabilitation, development, and prosperity.\nThe proposal considers the sharp deterioration in the condition of the Palestinian public and leadership, along with the success of Israel as a regional island of freedom, prosperity, and stability, as factors that could facilitate this solution. Additionally, it recognizes the need for an educational process to reintegrate Palestinians into Israeli society, involving learning Hebrew, Jewish culture, history, and traditions.\nThis proposal is based on a combination of historical, anthropological, and genetic research, and it emphasizes the importance of changing perspectives and understanding the shared roots of Jews and Palestinians to achieve a lasting peace.

He is known for his significant contributions to the Israeli software industry, including founding Sapiens International Corporation and developing Rule-Based Object-Oriented technology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Misinai, a secular Jew, self-educated in historical and anthropological subjects, shifted his focus to researching the common Hebrew roots he believes are shared by world Jewry and the Palestinians, including Arab citizens of Israel. This change in focus came after the failure of the Oslo Accords and the commencement of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000.\nMisinai\u0026rsquo;s theory, detailed in his book \u0026ldquo;Brother shall not lift sword against brother,\u0026rdquo; suggests that the majority of Palestinian people are descendants of ancient Hebrews. He posits that the Hebrew ancestors of Palestinians were rural dwellers who remained in the land of Israel to work and supply Rome with grain and olive oil. His work claims that the Hebrew origin of Palestinians was an openly discussed topic until relatively recent history. He also states that a significant portion of Palestinians underwent forced conversion to Islam during the Fatimid era under Caliph al-Hakim\u0026rsquo;s reign, leading to a significant Arabization of these populations.\nMisinai categorizes Palestinians into three main groups: \u0026ldquo;Descendants of Israel,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Brethren of Israel,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Palestinians of miscellaneous origins.\u0026rdquo; He asserts that the \u0026ldquo;Descendants of Israel\u0026rdquo; are direct descendants of ancient biblical Hebrews from the Kingdom of Judah, whereas the \u0026ldquo;Brethren of Israel\u0026rdquo; include descendants of the brother nations of the Hebrews, like the Edomites, Ammonites, and Moabites. These groups were variously converted to Judaism before the Roman invasion and then to Christianity and Islam. He further claims that nearly 90% of Palestinians living in Israel proper and the occupied territories are of Hebrew descent.\nMisinai\u0026rsquo;s controversial views have led to the development of \u0026ldquo;The Engagement,\u0026rdquo; a project aimed at bringing peace to Israel by promoting the idea of a shared ancestry between Jews and Palestinians.

Gibson, a historical researcher, embarks on a quest to investigate the origins of Islam, challenging the conventional narrative about the birthplace of the religion.\nThe central thesis of Gibson\u0026rsquo;s documentary is the controversial claim that the Islamic holy city of Mecca, as known today, was not the original location mentioned in early Islamic texts. He argues that the descriptions of Mecca in early Islamic scriptures do not align with the geographical and archaeological realities of the current city. Instead, Gibson suggests that the original holy site of Islam was located in Petra, in modern-day Jordan.\nThroughout the documentary, Gibson meticulously examines archaeological evidence, ancient manuscripts, and architectural remnants to support his theory. He points out discrepancies in the directional alignment of early mosques, which, according to his research, face Petra rather than Mecca. This finding is crucial to his argument, as the Qibla, or the direction towards which Muslims pray, is a fundamental aspect of Islamic practice.\nGibson delves into the historical context of the early Islamic period, exploring how the city of Petra, a major trading hub and a cultural melting pot, could have been a more likely setting for the emergence of Islam. He examines the city\u0026rsquo;s religious significance in pre-Islamic times, its architectural wonders like the Al-Khazneh temple, and its strategic location along ancient trade routes.\nThe documentary also explores the possible reasons for the shift of the sacred city from Petra to Mecca, suggesting political, religious, and social factors that might have influenced this change. Gibson hypothesizes that the relocation could have been a strategic move by Islamic leaders to consolidate power or to distance the religion from its pre-Islamic roots.\n\u0026ldquo;The Sacred City\u0026rdquo; challenges viewers to reconsider accepted historical narratives and invites a re-examination of Islamic history. Gibson\u0026rsquo;s work is a call for further research and dialogue in the academic community, urging historians and archaeologists to look beyond traditional sources and consider alternative evidence in understanding the past.\nExternal links # The Sacred City (website) Nabatea - Let the Stones Speak (related website) Dan Gibson | YouTube Dan Gibson (author)| Wikipedia "},{"id":"88","href":"/ru/resources/the-scars-of-eden/","title":"The Scars of Eden: Has humanity confused the idea of God with memories of ET contact?","description":"\"The Scars of Eden\" by Paul Wallis, following his previous work \"Escaping from Eden,\" explores whether the world's mythologies, including the Bible, are actual accounts of God or ancestral memories of extraterrestrial contact.

At its core, Cyberparadism focuses on using technology to enhance the human experience, promote sustainability, and foster a collective sense of purpose and responsibility. It is not a political or economic manifesto, but rather an aesthetic declaration that seeks to inspire and stimulate imagination. The manifesto embraces the idea that technology can create a world of abundance, equity, and harmony with nature. It promotes values such as ingenuity, continuity, and siblinghood and emphasizes the responsible use of technology to create a better world. Cyberparadism is seen as a pathway to a future where technology and nature coexist harmoniously, enhancing rather than detracting from the natural world‚Äã‚Äã.","content":"The Techno-Optimist Manifesto presents a vision of a future where technology is the driving force behind societal progress and human well-being. It challenges the pervasive narrative that technology causes harm, such as job loss, environmental degradation, and societal ills, arguing instead that technology has been, and should continue to be, a source of human advancement and achievement.\nCentral to the manifesto is the belief that societies, like sharks, must continue to grow or face decline. Growth, according to the manifesto, leads to vitality, expansion of life, increased knowledge, and higher well-being. The Techno-Optimists argue that economic growth is essential, and that stagnation leads to negative outcomes like zero-sum thinking, internal conflict, and societal collapse.\nThe manifesto identifies three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. With the first two facing limitations due to demographic trends and environmental constraints, technology is seen as the primary, sustainable driver of future growth. Techno-Optimists view technology as a lever on the world, allowing for more to be achieved with less, and as the main source of growth throughout history.\nThe Techno-Optimist Manifesto calls for a renewed embrace of technology, urging society to recognize its potential to build a better world. It advocates for a shift in perspective, from pessimism and fear about technological change to optimism and excitement about the possibilities it offers. The manifesto serves as a rallying cry for those who believe in the power of technology to transform society for the better, promoting a vision of a future where technology enhances human capabilities and leads to a more prosperous and equitable world.\nAbout Marc Andreessen # Marc Andreessen is a prominent American entrepreneur, investor, and software engineer, renowned for his influential role in shaping the modern internet landscape.

In this way, a working hypothesis is an accepted starting point for further research. A hypothesis in turn is simply put a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.\nThe working hypothesis that is being considered here is that the integrality of life on planet Earth present and past has been genetically engineered by a highly advanced, highly sophisticated humanoid civilization of interstellar travellers. This extraterrestrial civilization we collectively remember as the Celestials arrived on Earth some 25'000 years ago, subsequently terraformed the shallow oceans into barren land masses and started genetically engineering new life forms ex nihilo, ultimately leading to the creation of a new humanoid species in their own image. What followed this genesis of what is essentially the creation of mankind has been preserved in several religious and esoteric traditions culminating in the preservation and propagation of the Biblical scriptures throughout the world commemorating the origins of life on Earth. Besides religious scriptures, a wide body of remnants in folklore, archeology, paleontology and geology bear witness to this testimony.\nThroughout human history, various people have been contacted directly or indirectly to act as ambassadors and messengers on behalf of the Celestials to guide progress of humanity on one hand and to safeguard the memory of whom created life on Earth on the other hand. The ultimate goal is to determine whether or not humanity can independently overcome self-destruction once reaching the scientific and technological capababilities which serves as an evulation if humanity deserves to inherit the technological legacy of the Celestials, hence taking over the torch as the next chain link of this interstellar species.\nWeb knowledge base # A knowledge base is a self-serve online library of information about a given topic. The data in such a knowledge base can come from anywhere and typically comes from contributors who are well versed in the relevant subjects who ultimately add to and expand the knowledge base. In order to explore and properly investigate the working hypothesis elaborated above, a solid knowledge base is essential to identify, catalogue and contextualize all related information that can contribute to this end.\nThe knowledge base is a web presence that provides all the information and data necessary to foster insight and research through a modern user experience. It features an unabbreviated narrated introduction that handholds the newcomer, an extensive wiki that serves as a launch pad for the curious minds, a library of resources that references books and links for thorough deep dives and a blog which comments on the latest news that extend and contextualize further the working hypothesis.\nContinous development # The latest developments in web technology make it progressively more accesible to build and host independent web content platforms. Wheel of Heaven makes extensive use of various open source technologies to provide the most integrated and most efficient developer experience. To this end, content management and content itself is hosted as various git projects which generate static web pages which in turn are hosted on the Github CDN. Everyone is invited to contribute to the Wheel of Heaven project to provide an even better user and developer experience.\nMeaning of Wheel of Heaven # Wheel of Heaven is a direct reference to the precessional cycle of 25'920 years. Similarly to the days and years, two cycles that account for two distinct scales of time, the precession is a cycle that accounts for a much longer scale of time than days or years, expressly thousand of years. It is only natural to use units of time based on the precessional cycle to typify world ages. Precession based world ages have been used in the past to position oneself on a larger scale of time. The Biblical Book of Genesis uses precessional days to account for the consecutive steps of its creation narrative, the so-called seven days of creation, which stand for more than half a precessional cycle, namely around 13'000 years.\nThe units of the precessional cycle are called Great Months and we name each of these Great Months after the Zodiacal sign under which the sun is rising on the vernal equinox. Since 1950, while the sun is still rising in the sign of Pisces on the vernal equinox, we have entered the Age of Aquarius as the Great Month of the Age of Pisces lasted for 2'160 years and finished in 1950. That\u0026rsquo;s why many say that we live in a new age, the Aquarian age. The Wheel of Heaven therefore points to the importance of precessional world ages and that it cannot be mere coincidence that world transforming events happened at the very passing from one world age to the next one.\nThe Wheel of Heaven, besides being a direct reference to an astronimical cycle that can be perceived in the heavens above us, as it happens, is also a more obscure reference to spherical spacecrafts, allegedly belonging to the Celestials describted at the outset. Such a spacecraft may have been observed by the infamous Egyptian pharao Akhenaton. He described a fiery spaceship in the shape of a flat disk that appeared to him and asked him to build a new capital city which he shall name Armana. The Egyptians recorded the object that Akhenaton had seen and simply named it the Wheel of Heaven.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Neo-Euhemerism Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ra√´lism Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Wheel of Heaven External links # Wheel of Heaven | Github "},{"id":"95","href":"/ru/resources/wonders-in-the-sky/","title":"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times","description":"\"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times\" by Jacques Vall√©e and Chris Aubeck is a comprehensive investigation into the history of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The book examines over 500 reports of UFO sightings from ancient times up to the year 1879, a period before the profound changes brought by the Industrial Revolution and the advent of modern aircraft like airplanes and dirigibles.\nThe work is noted for its rigorous approach to paranormal investigation, presenting a detailed compendium of pre-twentieth-century UFO accounts. Vall√©e and Aubeck, both respected researchers in the field of unexplained phenomena, delve into sightings that occurred in an era when human society had not yet developed the technology to take to the skies. This historical context adds a layer of intrigue to the sightings they document, as it rules out contemporary sources of aerial phenomena like aircraft.\nIn addition to documenting these sightings, the book explores their impact on human culture, history, and beliefs. The accounts are not only seen as mere reports of unexplained aerial objects but are also analyzed for their cultural and historical significance, providing insights into how these sightings may have shaped human understanding and beliefs over the centuries.\n\u0026ldquo;Wonders in the Sky\u0026rdquo; is acknowledged as one of the most ambitious works in the field of paranormal investigation, shedding light on a largely unexplored aspect of UFO phenomena and their place in human history‚Äã.\nAbout Jacques Vall√©e # Jacques Vallee is a French-American computer scientist, author, and ufologist. Born in France in 1939, Vallee obtained a PhD in computer science from Northwestern University in the United States in 1967, and later worked at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in California.\nVallee is known for his research on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the paranormal. His best-known book, \u0026ldquo;Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying Saucers,\u0026rdquo; explores the links between traditional myths and legends and modern UFO sightings, and proposes that both may be rooted in a common phenomenon of human consciousness.\nVallee has also written extensively on the social and cultural implications of emerging technologies, and has been a prominent advocate for responsible innovation and ethical consideration of new technologies.

In the Bible, he is described as the father of Isaac and a patriarch of the Israelites. In the Tanakh, he is considered the first Hebrew and the founder of the Jewish nation. In the Quran, Abraham is considered a prophet of Allah and a friend of God.\nIn the Bible, Abraham is described as:\nA Chaldean from Ur, who was called by God to leave his home and journey to a new land (Genesis 12:1-3) A faithful servant of God who was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22) The founder of the covenant between God and the Israelites, through which God promised to make Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants a great nation (Genesis 12:1-3, 15:18) The ancestor of Jesus (Matthew 1:1-17) Historical context # Abraham is a central figure in the Abrahamic religions as previousley mentioned, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. His life, as per religious tradition, is thought to have taken place around 2000 BCE, though it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that this is not a historically verifiable timeline since written history doesn\u0026rsquo;t extend well that far back in the Middle East.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s story begins in the Book of Genesis, where it\u0026rsquo;s mentioned that he was born in Ur of the Chaldeans1, spelled ◊ê◊ï÷º◊® ◊õ÷∑÷º◊©÷∞◊Ç◊ì÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù ( æ≈´r Ka≈õdƒ´m) in the Hebrew Bible, an ancient city-state in the region we now call southern Iraq. This location, situated between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is part of Mesopotamia, one of the cradles of human civilization. In Abraham\u0026rsquo;s time, this region was likely a complex landscape of various city-states, small kingdoms, and tribal alliances.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s father, Terah, decided to move the family from Ur towards Canaan, but they ended up settling in Haran. Haran was located further north, near the modern border between Turkey and Syria. It was an important hub of trade and exerted a considerable amount of cultural and religious influence in the region.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s journey continued when the Elohim commanded him to leave Haran and travel to Canaan. The land of Canaan corresponds roughly to today\u0026rsquo;s Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Jordan and Syria, with a location along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, a region often referred to as the Levant. In biblical times, Canaan was a patchwork of various city-states, each having its own king.\nDuring a severe famine, Abraham and his wife Sarai (later renamed Sarah) undertook a journey to Egypt. Egypt, a remarkable civilization in northeast Africa, was one of the world\u0026rsquo;s earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, centered along the fertile Nile River. It would have been a powerful kingdom and a hub of culture and learning in the ancient world at the time of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s visit.\nLater in his life, Abraham made his home in Hebron, a city in the southern part of Canaan. Hebron is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world and is of great religious importance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It is in Hebron that the Cave of the Patriarchs, the supposed burial site of Abraham and Sarah, is located.\nEtymology # The name \u0026ldquo;Abraham\u0026rdquo; comes from the Hebrew name ◊ê÷∑◊ë÷∞◊®÷∏◊î÷∏◊ù (Avraham). It\u0026rsquo;s composed of two parts: \u0026ldquo;Av\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;raham\u0026rdquo;, which is thought to mean \u0026ldquo;multitude\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo;. Thus, the name Abraham is often interpreted as \u0026ldquo;father of many\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;father of a multitude\u0026rdquo;.2 Initially, his name was Abram (◊ê÷∑◊ë÷∞◊®÷∏◊ù)3, meaning \u0026ldquo;exalted father\u0026rdquo;, but it was changed to Abraham after God\u0026rsquo;s promise that he would become the father of many nations (Genesis 17:5).\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Abraham is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with Ra√´l. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, showcases the mentioning of Abraham:\nLater, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.\nLay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim. ‚Äî Genesis 22: 12.4\nThis passage is discussing a story from the book of Genesis in the Bible, where the Elohim wanted to test the people of Israel, particularly their leader, Abraham, to see if they still held positive feelings towards them. At the time of the test, the people had relapsed into a semi-primitive state after many of their intellectuals were destroyed. The test involved Abraham being asked to sacrifice his own son, and his willingness to do so was taken as a sign of his loyalty and devotion to the creators. The creators ultimately intervened and prevented the sacrifice, indicating that they were satisfied with Abraham\u0026rsquo;s loyalty.\nLegacy # Abraham is a pivotal figure in the Adamite struggle, particularly known for his role in the aftermath of the cataclysm that wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah. As a leader of the remainder of the Adamite community, he played a significant part in fostering a renewed relationship with the Elohim creators, a relationship strained by the sequence of catastrophic events and the societal upheaval they caused.\nIn a key episode known as the Sacrifice of Abraham, the creators tested Abraham\u0026rsquo;s loyalty and his community\u0026rsquo;s sentiments towards them. This event is portrayed as a testament of faith, with Abraham willing to sacrifice his son in response to a perceived command from the creators. The test was not to examine Abraham\u0026rsquo;s obedience, but rather to assess the strength of the positive feelings and the quality of the relationship the Adamites had towards their creators.\nIn a symbolic gesture, the creators intervened just as Abraham was about to carry out the sacrifice, thereby indicating the completion of the test and signifying their satisfaction with the outcome. This event confirmed the Adamites\u0026rsquo; loyalty to their creators, marking a critical turning point in the relationship between the creators and their synthetic progeny.\nAbraham\u0026rsquo;s unwavering loyalty and his subsequent actions laid the groundwork for a renewed relationship between the Adamites and the Elohim.\nOur take # One of the main aspects of the Wheel of Heaven exegesis is that the whole timeline of the events described in the Biblical scriptures and subsequently in the Ra√´lian revelations happen within one precessional cycle of 25\u0026#39;920 years. Considering this, the events during Abraham\u0026rsquo;s lifetime are presumed to have occured during the Age of Taurus, a period of time that falls between 4'530 to 2'370 BCE.\nAbraham served as an important caesura in the relationship between human beings on Earth and their extraterrestrial creator parents, the Elohim. Up until that point, human beings enjoyed a certain level of self-determination and autonomy. After the Great Flood cataclysmically reset life on Earth and the planet had to be repopulated, the postdiluvian human civilization grew fast demographically and technologically with the help of the banished creators that also had to remain on Earth and the technology and scientif wealth either safeguarded during the cataclysm or salvaged thereafter.\nThe banished creators were pardoned and had left since the days of the diplomatic spacecraft mission commonly known as the Tower of Babel, progress and the level of scientific sophistication vanished with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, both cities the remaining two centers of innovation. Abraham served the purpose of being prove that humanity remained non-hostile and became one of the first ambassadors (prophet) appointed by the Elohim to preserve their legacy.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Prophet Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sodom and Gomorrah Wiki ‚Ä∫ Tower of Babel Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Taurus # Abraham External links # Abraham | Wikipedia Abraham (Hebrew Patriach) | Britannica Abraham | Jewish Encyclopedia Abraham, the Patriach | World History Encyclopedia The word ◊ê◊ï÷º◊® (\u0026lsquo;ur) is a loanword from the Sumerian íãÄíÄïíÜ† (urim‚ÇÖki, pronounced urim), both meaning city.

They are considered the first human beings created by God, and are believed to have lived in the Garden of Eden before disobeying God\u0026rsquo;s command and being expelled from the garden (Genesis 3). Adam is described as the first man created by God from the dust of the ground, while Eve is described as the first woman, created from one of Adam\u0026rsquo;s ribs (Genesis 2:7, 2:22). Adam and Eve\u0026rsquo;s story is often seen as an allegory for the origin of sin and the fall of humanity.\nEtymology # The etymology of the name of both Adam and Eve is uncertain, and several etymological theories have been proposed for each name on their own.\nOne theory is that the name Adam is derived from the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adamah\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;soil\u0026rdquo;.1 This is in line with the biblical account of Adam being formed from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7). Another theory is that the name \u0026ldquo;Adam\u0026rdquo; is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;adamu\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;to make\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to create.\u0026rdquo; This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Adam as the first human being created by the Elohim. A third theory is that the name \u0026ldquo;Adam\u0026rdquo; is related to the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adom,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;.2 This interpretation is based on the idea that the color red symbolizes life and vitality, and that the name Adam reflects the idea of the first human as the source of life.\nOn for Adam\u0026rsquo;s companion Eve, the etymology of the name Eve is as already mention neither certain, but it is thought to be derived from the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;chavah\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;to give life\u0026rdquo;.3 This interpretation is in line with the biblical account of Eve being the mother of all living things (Genesis 3:20). Another theory is that the name Eve is related to the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;haya\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;to live\u0026rdquo;. This interpretation emphasizes the idea of Eve as the source of life for all humankind. In addition, the name Eve has been connected to the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;awwatu\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;living one\u0026rdquo;, further emphasizing the idea of Eve as a symbol of life and vitality.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Adam and Eve are mentioned briefly by Yahweh. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ mentions two children growing up among the Elohim creators located in Eden:\n[\u0026hellip;] Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.\nAnd two paragraphs later, these two children are identified as Adam and Eve when they\u0026rsquo;re being confronted with the truth of having been synthetically engineered by the creators.\nAnd Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, \u0026lsquo;Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed\u0026hellip; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\u0026rsquo;\n‚Äî Genesis 3: 14.\nThe \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.\nUnto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them.\n‚Äî Genesis 3: 21.\nThe creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, enough to manage without needing any further contact with them.4\nThis passage is from the book of Genesis in the Bible and describes the story of Adam and Eve. In the story, the Serpent, a group of the Elohim creators that wanted their genetically engineered children to know about their origins, tells Adam and Eve the truth, which results in the Serpentine group being judged by the governing body of the Elohimian civilization, which forced them to live in exile on Earth from theron. Adam and Eve are then provided with clothing made and means of survival by the banished Elohimian creators.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Adamites Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Intelligent Design Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Leo External links # Adam and Eve | Wikipedia Adam and Eve | Britannica Adam | Jewish Encyclopedia Eve | Jewish Encyclopedia The Hebrew word ◊ê◊ì◊ù (adam) has cognates in several ancient Near Eastern languages, such as Phoenician and Ugaritic, typically signifying \u0026ldquo;man\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo;.

They should not be confused with the sect of early Christian Adamites who were active during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. Despite sharing the same name, the two groups are entirely unrelated. The Adamites discussed in this article are described in certain interpretations of ancient scriptures as having participated in a union with a rebellious faction of the Elohim known as the Serpent, resulting in a hybrid offspring. This distinct population then merged into a singular group, collectively known as the Adamites.\nEtymology # The etymology of the name of both Adam and Adamites is uncertain, and several etymological theories have been proposed.\nOne theory is that the name Adam is derived from the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;adamah\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;soil\u0026rdquo;.1 This is in line with the biblical account of Adam being formed from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7).

According to the text, the Apocalypse involves a series of cataclysmic events, including wars, plagues, natural disasters, and the rise of the Antichrist. At the climax of these events, there will be a final battle between good and evil, and Jesus Christ will return to Earth to defeat Satan and establish a new heaven and a new earth.\nThe exact nature and timing of the events described in the Apocalypse are a matter of interpretation and have been the subject of much debate throughout history. Some believe that the Apocalypse is a literal depiction of the end of the world, while others interpret it symbolically or allegorically. Regardless of one\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, the Apocalypse is a central aspect of many Christian beliefs about the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ.\nEtymology # The word \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; originates from the Ancient Greek term \u0026ldquo;·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ¨ŒªœÖœàŒπœÇ\u0026rdquo; (apok√°lupsis), which means to reveal or unveil.1 It is related to the Greek word \u0026ldquo;Œ∫·æ∞Œª·ø†ÃÅœÄœÑœâ\u0026rdquo; (kal√∫pt≈ç) meaning \u0026ldquo;to hide\u0026rdquo;.2 In Greek mythology, Calypso, the daughter of the Titan Atlas, is a character who embodies the concept of hiding knowledge. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; refers to the uncovering of knowledge that was previously hidden or concealed.\nContrary to popular belief, \u0026ldquo;apocalypse\u0026rdquo; does not necessarily signify a cataclysmic or apocalyptic event that marks the end of days. Instead, it denotes a period of time during which a series of revelations will reveal the truth. In the Age of Apocalypse, people will gain access to knowledge that was previously unknown or hidden, leading to a better understanding of the world and its workings.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter The Keys, the Apocalypse as the Age of Revelation is mentioned in the context of being one of the keys to unlock our potential:\nDo not forget that the Apocalypse ‚Äîliterally the \u0026ldquo;age of revelation\u0026rdquo;‚Äî has arrived as was predicted. It has been said that when the time comes, there will be many false prophets. You only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come. False prophets are writers of horoscopes of which the newspapers are full, and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the Elohim to the primitive people of ancient times.\nSuch false prophets prefer to believe what narrow-minded and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. They should instead believe the message of the Elohim that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky. These latter people try to understand the universe, and they can be addressed as adults.\nThis passage discusses the arrival of the Apocalypse, also known as the Age of Revelation, and the presence of false prophets during this time. The author argues that false prophets can be found in those who reject the benefits of science and instead cling to ancient writings that were given to primitive people by the Elohim.\nThe author suggests that these primitive people fearfully copied down messages from those they considered to be gods because they came from the sky. However, the author argues that people should instead believe the message of the Elohim that is being given now to people who try to understand their place in the universe and can be addressed as adults.\nThe context of this passage is the Age of Apocalypse, which is a concept found in various religions and refers to a time of great upheaval and change. The author suggests that in this time of change, it is important to listen to the message of the Elohim, rather than false prophets who hold on to narrow-minded and primitive beliefs. The author also emphasizes the importance of scientific understanding and critical thinking.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Golden Age Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sa·πÉsƒÅra Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aquarius External links # Apocalypse | Wikipedia Biblical Apocalypse | World History Encyclopedia From ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÄœÑœâ (apokal√∫pt≈ç, ‚Äúto disclose, reveal‚Äù) + -œÉŒπœÇ (-sis).

By investigating the ways in which ancient civilizations observed, recorded, and utilized astronomical information, archaeoastronomy aims to enrich our understanding of their worldviews, religious beliefs, and social organization.\nOne of the central aims of archaeoastronomy is to identify and understand the astronomical alignments of ancient monuments and structures. These alignments may have been intended for calendrical purposes, such as marking the solstices, equinoxes, or other significant astronomical events. In some cases, these alignments may have had religious or ceremonial significance, reflecting the importance of celestial events in the culture\u0026rsquo;s mythologies and rituals. Notable examples of such alignments can be found in Stonehenge in England, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and Chichen Itza in Mexico.\nArchaeoastronomy also investigates the use of celestial navigation by ancient societies. Many cultures developed advanced methods for determining their position and direction by observing the stars, the sun, and the moon. The Polynesians, for example, were skilled navigators who used the stars to sail vast distances across the Pacific Ocean. Similarly, the ancient Maya developed a sophisticated calendar system based on the observation of celestial bodies, which allowed them to track time and predict astronomical events with remarkable accuracy.\nThe study of ancient astronomical knowledge and practices can provide valuable insights into the development of scientific thought, as well as the broader cultural context in which that knowledge was produced and transmitted. Astronomical observations were often closely linked to religious beliefs, as celestial events were seen as manifestations of divine power or omens of future events. This connection is evident in the elaborate mythologies and cosmologies that many cultures developed to explain the movements of celestial bodies and their influence on human affairs.\nIn recent years, archaeoastronomy has benefited from advances in technology and methodology, including remote sensing, satellite imagery, and computer modeling. These tools have allowed researchers to analyze archaeological sites and artifacts with greater precision, revealing new insights into the astronomical practices of ancient civilizations. Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, anthropologists, and astronomers has led to a more nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which astronomical knowledge was produced and used.\nAstronomical alignments # Many ancient structures, including the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, show evidence of astronomical alignments. These alignments often served as markers of celestial events or reflected the builders\u0026rsquo; understanding of the cosmos. Here, we will discuss the astronomical alignments of the Giza pyramid complex and a few other notable sites.\nGiza Pyramid Complex, Egypt # The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, the Pyramid of Menkaure, and the Great Sphinx. These monuments are believed to have been built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2580-2560 BCE. Several astronomical alignments have been identified at the site.\nCardinal directions: The Great Pyramid of Giza, built as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu, is remarkably aligned to the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west). Its sides are almost perfectly aligned with true north, within a margin of error of just a few arcminutes. This precision suggests that the builders had advanced knowledge of astronomy and surveying techniques.\nOrion\u0026rsquo;s Belt: The three pyramids of Giza are said to be aligned in a manner that resembles the stars of Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt in the Orion constellation. The alignment suggests that the pyramids\u0026rsquo; layout may have been intended to represent the stars in Orion\u0026rsquo;s Belt, which held religious significance for the ancient Egyptians, as they associated it with the god Osiris.\nEquinoxial markers: The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is unique among the pyramids in Egypt for its subtle concavity on each of its four faces. This concavity divides each face into two slightly inclined halves, resulting in the pyramid having a total of eight sides rather than the usual four. This feature is difficult to notice from ground level and is most visible during the equinoxes when the rising or setting sun casts a shadow on the pyramid, emphasizing the concavity.\nGreat Sphinx of Giza # The Great Sphinx of Giza is a colossal statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, believed to represent Pharaoh Khafre. The lion symbolism can be linked to the astrological sign of Leo and the constellation of the same name. In ancient cultures, the lion was often associated with strength, power, and royalty. In ancient Egyptian mythology, the lion was a symbol of protection and was associated with several deities, such as Sekhmet, the goddess of war and healing, and Maahes, the lion-headed god of war.\nThe astrological Age of Leo, as mentioned earlier, is an epoch in which the vernal equinox occurs in the constellation of Leo. During this time, around 10,500 BCE, the constellation Leo would have risen just before the Sun at dawn. The symbolism of the Sphinx as a lion can be connected to this celestial event, as it represents the earthly manifestation of the celestial lion in the sky. The Sphinx, facing east, would have greeted the rising Sun, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness and embodying the power and protection of the lion.\nThe idea that the Great Sphinx of Giza could be a marker of the Age of Leo is based on the premise that the Sphinx was originally constructed to represent a lion and its alignment with the constellation Leo during a specific period known as the astrological Age of Leo.\nAstrological ages are determined by a phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes, which results from the slow wobble of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis over a cycle of approximately 25'920 years. This wobble causes the position of the vernal equinox (the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north) to slowly move westward along the ecliptic (the Sun\u0026rsquo;s apparent path across the sky). As a result, the vernal equinox shifts through the twelve constellations of the zodiac over time, spending approximately 2'160 years in each sign. The Age of Leo is believed to have occurred between 11'010 to 8'850 BCE.\nProponents of the theory that the Sphinx marks the Age of Leo argue that the monument was originally built with the body of a lion, and its face was later re-carved to resemble the Pharaoh Khafre. According to this theory, during the Age of Leo, around 10,500 BCE, the vernal equinox would have occurred in the constellation of Leo, which would have risen just before the Sun at dawn. As a result, the lion-shaped Sphinx would have faced its celestial counterpart in the sky, symbolically linking the two.\nWater erosion # The erosion patterns on the Sphinx and the Giza pyramid complex have been the subject of much debate among geologists, archaeologists, and alternative researchers. Some of the erosion patterns, particularly on the Sphinx and its surrounding enclosure, appear to be consistent with water erosion rather than the more typical wind and sand erosion seen in desert environments.\nProponents of the water erosion hypothesis argue that the vertical and undulating patterns on the Sphinx\u0026rsquo;s limestone body and the enclosure walls suggest that the monument was subjected to heavy rainfall or even flooding at some point in its history. The climatic conditions in Egypt during the Early and Middle Holocene (around 10,000 to 4,000 BCE) were wetter than they are today, with more rainfall and the presence of savannah-like ecosystems in the area. Some researchers argue that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx could be evidence of its construction during a period of greater precipitation, possibly before the emergence of the dynastic Egyptian civilization as we know it.\nStonehenge, England # Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a circle of standing stones. It was constructed in several stages between 3000 and 2000 BCE. The site has several astronomical alignments.\nSummer Solstice: One of the most famous alignments at Stonehenge occurs during the summer solstice. As the sun rises, it aligns with the Heel Stone, creating a spectacle where the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays pass through the central axis of the monument. This alignment suggests that Stonehenge may have been used as a calendar or to mark important seasonal events.\nWinter Solstice: The site is also aligned with the winter solstice sunset. The sun sets between the two tallest stones in the monument, known as the Trilithon, during the winter solstice. This alignment further supports the idea that Stonehenge had astronomical and calendrical functions.\nChichen Itza, Mexico # Chichen Itza is a Maya city in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, that thrived between 600 and 1200 CE. The site is renowned for its impressive architecture and astronomical alignments.\nEl Castillo: The step pyramid known as El Castillo or the Temple of Kukulcan is the most famous structure at Chichen Itza. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, the pyramid\u0026rsquo;s design creates a striking play of light and shadow. As the sun sets, triangular shadows form along the side of the northern stairway, giving the appearance of a serpent descending the pyramid. This phenomenon likely held religious significance for the Maya, who associated the serpent with the god Kukulcan. Angkor Wat, Cambodia # Angkor Wat, built in the early 12th century, is the largest religious monument globally and a stunning example of Khmer architecture. The temple complex was initially dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu and later converted to a Buddhist temple. The main temple\u0026rsquo;s western entrance is aligned with the spring equinox. On this day, the sun rises directly over the central tower, creating a visual spectacle. The alignment may represent the balance between light and darkness, echoing Hindu cosmological beliefs.\nTemple of Karnak, Egypt # The Karnak temple complex in Luxor, Egypt, is one of the largest religious sites in the world, dating back to around 2000 BCE. The main temple is dedicated to the god Amun-Ra. The temple\u0026rsquo;s axis aligns with the winter solstice sunrise, allowing the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays to illuminate the inner sanctum, where the statue of Amun-Ra resided. This alignment may have been designed to imbue the statue with the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy, enhancing the god\u0026rsquo;s power.\nAlternative researchers # In recent years, alternative researchers like Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock, and John Anthony West have introduced new perspectives and hypotheses in the field of archaeoastronomy and archaeology more broadly. While their work is often controversial and not always accepted by mainstream academia, it has contributed to a re-examination of certain aspects of ancient cultures, their knowledge, and their capabilities. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to note that their research is often considered \u0026ldquo;fringe\u0026rdquo; because it challenges conventional wisdom or explores topics that are not widely accepted by the academic community.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that alternative researchers like Carlson, Hancock, and West have faced skepticism and criticism from mainstream academics, who argue that their hypotheses often lack rigorous evidence or proper methodology. However, their work has undeniably generated public interest and brought attention to the field of archaeoastronomy and ancient civilizations. In some cases, their research has encouraged further investigation and has led to new discoveries or the re-evaluation of existing evidence.\nRandall Carlson # Randall Carlson is a geological and anthropological theorist known for his work on the potential impact of cosmic events, such as asteroid impacts or cometary debris, on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and human history. He has suggested that these events may have caused cataclysms that contributed to the collapse of ancient civilizations and the end of the last Ice Age. His work has inspired discussions about the role of natural disasters in shaping human history and the potential astronomical knowledge of ancient cultures.\nGraham Hancock # Graham Hancock is an author and journalist who has written extensively about ancient civilizations, proposing that there may have been a highly advanced, prehistoric civilization that was wiped out by a global cataclysm. In his book \u0026ldquo;Fingerprints of the Gods,\u0026rdquo; Hancock presents evidence for this lost civilization, including astronomical alignments and advanced knowledge of precession among ancient cultures. While many of his ideas are not accepted by mainstream archaeologists, Hancock\u0026rsquo;s work has captured the public\u0026rsquo;s imagination and has contributed to a broader interest in ancient civilizations and their astronomical knowledge.\nJohn Anthony West # John Anthony West was an independent Egyptologist who challenged the traditional dating of the Sphinx in Egypt. He argued that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx indicate that it is much older than previously believed, suggesting that it was constructed by a more ancient civilization with advanced knowledge of astronomy. West\u0026rsquo;s work has been controversial, but it has spurred further research and debate on the age of the Sphinx and the potential astronomical significance of other ancient Egyptian monuments.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Builders Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of megalithic sites Wiki ‚Ä∫ Precession External links # Archaeoastronomy | Wikipedia "},{"id":"101","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è","description":"–ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è, –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π, –∏–∑—É—á–∞—é—â–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –≤–æ –í—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π. –ü–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –≤–æ –í—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –æ–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–∞–ª–∞—Å—å, –∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—é –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤—É—é –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥—å –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å—É–µ—Ç, –ø—Ä–∏ –∫–∞–∫–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–∞ –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å.","content":"Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary field of study that investigates the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. It combines knowledge from astronomy, biology, geology, and other sciences to understand the conditions necessary for life to exist, both on Earth and elsewhere. To research the possibility of extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists use various techniques and tools such as searching for evidence of past or present life on other planets, moons, or asteroids in our solar system, looking for signs of life on exoplanets around other stars, and studying the chemical and physical conditions necessary for life to form and survive. This research helps us to better understand our place in the universe and answer one of the most fundamental questions in science: are we alone in the universe?\nThe search of extraterrestrial life # Astrobiology, as a field of study, has been steadily growing over the past decades, driven by the increasing number of exoplanet discoveries and our ability to probe deeper into the universe. As we continue to uncover the vast array of planetary bodies within our own solar system and beyond, the potential for finding life, in some form or another, grows increasingly possible.\nNotably, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars rover missions, such as the Mars Science Laboratory mission with the Curiosity rover, have been pivotal in the search for life beyond Earth. These missions have focused on understanding whether Mars, our closest planetary neighbor, has the conditions necessary to support life, either currently or in its past. As part of this ongoing research, rovers have identified traces of water and complex organic molecules, key elements necessary for life as we understand it.\nAdditionally, the study of extremophiles, organisms on Earth that thrive in extreme conditions, broadens our understanding of what constitutes a habitable environment. Microorganisms thriving in conditions of extreme heat, cold, or toxicity, demonstrate that life can potentially exist in environments far removed from our conventional understanding of habitability. Such insights have significant implications when considering potential extraterrestrial life, given the extreme conditions often encountered on other planets and moons.\nOne of the significant developments in astrobiology is the search for exoplanets in the habitable zone (or \u0026ldquo;Goldilocks zone\u0026rdquo;) around other stars, where conditions might be \u0026ldquo;just right\u0026rdquo; for liquid water and thus life to exist. The Kepler mission, for example, has discovered a multitude of such planets, expanding the range of possible locales for extraterrestrial life.\nMethodology # The methods of astrobiology include:\nObservational astronomy: This refers to the direct observation of celestial bodies using telescopes and other detection devices. These observations can provide valuable information about the composition, temperature, and atmospheric properties of distant planets and other celestial bodies. With the aid of spectroscopy, astrobiologists can detect the presence of certain elements or compounds, such as methane or water, that might indicate the potential for life. Laboratory simulations and experiments: Astrobiologists often use laboratory experiments to simulate conditions on other planets or in outer space. This can help to determine what kind of life (if any) could survive under those conditions. For example, scientists might simulate the high-radiation environment of Mars or the high-pressure environment of a gas giant to see how certain organisms or organic compounds react. In situ measurements and sample analysis: The term \u0026ldquo;in situ\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;in place,\u0026rdquo; and in the context of astrobiology, it refers to measurements or experiments conducted directly on the celestial body of interest. For example, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars rovers perform in situ analysis of Martian soil and rocks to detect signs of past or present life. Future missions might return samples to Earth for further analysis. Theoretical modeling and computer simulations: These are used to predict what types of life might exist on other planets based on a variety of factors, including the type of star, the planet\u0026rsquo;s distance from its star, its size, its geological activity, and its atmosphere. Theoretical models also help understand how life might arise and evolve under different conditions. Analysis of meteorites and other extraterrestrial materials: The study of meteorites can provide valuable information about the early solar system and the potential for life on other planets. Some meteorites have been found to contain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, suggesting that the basic ingredients for life could be common throughout the universe. Study of Earth\u0026rsquo;s extremophiles and their potential habitability elsewhere: Extremophiles are organisms that can survive in extreme conditions, such as deep-sea vents, high-altitude lakes, or the arid Atacama Desert. By studying how these organisms survive and thrive, astrobiologists can infer what types of life might be possible on other planets with similarly extreme conditions. This research also helps define the limits of what we consider habitable environments. Each of these methods provides unique insights into the potential for life beyond Earth. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to astrobiology that combines direct observation, laboratory and field research, and theoretical modeling.\nRequirements for proof of evidence # Findings that would be considered strong indications of extraterrestrial life would include the discovery of a reliable and repeatable proof of the following conditions:\nThe existence of organic compounds, a key building block of life, beyond Earth: Organic compounds are those that contain carbon, and they form the basis of all known life. The discovery of such compounds in places other than Earth would suggest that the conditions necessary for life as we know it may exist elsewhere. This evidence could come in the form of complex organic molecules in the atmosphere or on the surface of other planets or moons, or in interstellar clouds of dust and gas.\nThe presence of liquid water, a vital requirement for life as we know it: All known organisms require liquid water to live and reproduce. The discovery of liquid water on other celestial bodies, such as the recent discoveries of liquid water under the surface of Mars or the ocean worlds of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s moon Europa and Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Enceladus, significantly boosts the chances that life could exist there.\nEvidence of metabolic activity or biogenic substances produced by living organisms: This could include the detection of gases in a planet\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere that are typically produced by biological activity, such as oxygen or methane. For example, Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere contains a high level of oxygen because of the photosynthetic activity of plants and some bacteria. Unusual concentrations or fluctuations of these gases could indicate metabolic activity. Additionally, the discovery of substances like fossil fuels or certain types of rock formations that we know are produced by life on Earth could also indicate the presence of life.\nThe detection of radio or optical signals that are indicative of intelligence: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is an ongoing scientific effort to detect signals from space that could indicate the existence of technologically advanced civilizations. These could be radio signals, optical pulses, or other types of signals that are unlikely to be produced by natural phenomena and that show signs of being artificially produced, such as patterns or sequences that suggest a coded message.\nDirect contact with extraterrestrial beings or discovery of artifacts: This would be the most definitive and compelling evidence of extraterrestrial life, but it is also the most unlikely to occur, given the vast distances between stars and the technological challenges of interstellar travel. However, should we encounter extraterrestrial beings or find artifacts clearly made by an intelligent non-human entity, whether on Earth, in our solar system, or on a distant planet, this would constitute unambiguous proof of life beyond Earth. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that while there have been numerous claims of such contact throughout history, none has been sufficiently substantiated with evidence that satisfies the scientific community.\nAccording to Carl Sagan # Carl Sagan made the following statement in his book \u0026ldquo;Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space\u0026rdquo; published in 1994.\nSince, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring‚Äìnot because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive\u0026hellip; If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.\nThe quote implies that space exploration and colonization is necessary for the survival of humanity in the long run. Sagan argues that the threat of impacts from space is a natural and inevitable danger that every civilization must eventually face, and becoming a spacefaring civilization is the only way to protect ourselves from this threat and ensure the survival of our species.\nAstrobiology remains a developing field, with its subject matter largely speculative until definitive proof of extraterrestrial life is found. As Carl Sagan once wrote, \u0026ldquo;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\u0026rdquo; To date, in the broad public domain, this evidence remains elusive, but the search continues.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his book The Coming of the Gods, Jean Sendy writes the following fundamental observation about astrobiology:\n\u0026ldquo;Astrophysics\u0026rdquo; is a neologism that was coined until about 1920, because until then the means of \u0026ldquo;studying tile phenomena of outer space from the standpoint of physics\u0026rdquo; were too embryonic to constitute a discipline. The word \u0026ldquo;exobiology,\u0026rdquo; which designates \u0026ldquo;the study of the phenomena of outer space from the standpoint of biology,\u0026rdquo; is a more recent neologim that appears only in the Dewest dictionaries. The domain of exobiology. however, is still nearly empty: the first hypotheses are heing fomulated, but they rest on nothing concrete. As long as we know nothing about tile evolution of life in the fest of the Galaxy, our biologists will be limited to one particular case: earthly life and evolution.\nJean Sendy provides an insightful observation on the fields of astrophysics and astrobiology (referred to as exobiology in this context). He notes that the term \u0026ldquo;astrophysics\u0026rdquo; only came into use around 1920, as the study of outer space phenomena through the lens of physics was still in its infancy.\nEven more recent, according to Sendy, is the term \u0026ldquo;exobiology,\u0026rdquo; which is the study of life in the universe from a biological perspective. This field is primarily concerned with understanding the conditions that may make life possible elsewhere, how such life might evolve, and how we might detect it.\nSendy underscores the inherent challenges of this discipline. At the time of his writing, he describes the field of exobiology as being \u0026ldquo;nearly empty,\u0026rdquo; with hypotheses only beginning to be formulated. The main challenge Sendy identifies is that our understanding of life is based solely on one example: life on Earth. Consequently, our ability to theorize about life elsewhere in the universe is limited by our understanding of earthly life and evolution.\nThis statement underscores the inherent complexity and speculative nature of astrobiology. Without concrete examples of life beyond Earth, our understanding and theories are based primarily on our knowledge of how life works here. As our ability to explore other planets and star systems improves, and as we make more detailed observations of our own planet and life, our understanding of what is possible in terms of life elsewhere in the universe will inevitably evolve and expand.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Drake equation External links # Astrobiology | Wikipedia Astrobiology (science) | Britannica "},{"id":"102","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–ë–æ—Ä—å–±–∞ –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤","description":"–ê–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –±–æ—Ä—å–±–∞ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º—É –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –æ –ø—É—Ç–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∫ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ –æ–ø—ã—Ç–µ –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤, —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –≤–æ–∑–Ω–∏–∫—à–µ–≥–æ –≤ –≠–¥–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–∞–¥—É. –≠—Ç–æ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è —Å–≤—è–∑—è–º —Å –º—è—Ç–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π –∫–∞–∫ –ó–º–µ–π, –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–ª–æ –≥–∏–±—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –≠—Ç–∏ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–∏ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–≥—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤ –µ–¥–∏–Ω—É—é, –Ω–æ –æ–±–æ—Å–æ–±–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—É, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—â—É—é –∫–∞–∫ –∏–∑ –≥–∏–±—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—ã—Ö, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ–≥–∏–±—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∫ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∏ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–º–∞–Ω—Å–∏–ø–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ—Ç —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥—è —ç—Ç–∞–ø—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è, –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –≤–æ–∑–º–µ–∑–¥–∏—è, –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ–π—á–∏–≤–æ –¥–æ–±–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –Ω–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏.","content":"Sequence of events # The Adamite Struggle refers an to epoch-spanning struggle that started in the Age of Leo, which delineates the course of humanity\u0026rsquo;s evolution from their creation to their eventual emergence as independent and autonomous entities. This narrative presents the perspective of the human Adamites, who were embroiled in a complex political struggle against their creators, the Elohim.\nThe Adamites, also referred to as early human beings in Eden, were created by Elohimite scientists on Earth. Initially, these beings were kept in ignorance about the identity of their creators, who presented themselves as divine figures. This dynamic changed when Lucifer, a leading Elohimite scientist, revealed to the Adamites their true origin, thereby sparking an intellectual revolution among the humans.\nThis act of enlightenment was viewed as insubordination by the governing body of the Elohim\u0026#39;s home planet. In response, Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals, enacted punitive measures, resulting in the eviction of the Adamites from their idyllic living conditions known as the Garden of Eden. Despite this expulsion, the Adamites showcased remarkable adaptability and resilience, leveraging their newfound knowledge and innate potential.\nAs their civilization advanced, the Adamites attempted an ambitious space exploration project, constructing the Tower of Babel as a symbol of their technological prowess. This interstellar mission aimed to gain pardon and acknowledgment from the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. However, these efforts were perceived as aggressive by the Elohim, leading to a period of disruption where the Adamites were scattered and their common language confounded.\nDespite the setbacks, the tenacity of the Adamites eventually led to their recognition by the Elohim, marking a milestone in their journey towards independence. However, this period was not without conflict. A vengeful faction among the Adamites sought to retaliate against those who had attempted to annihilate them, leading to the catastrophic obliteration of the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah.\nLegacy # The Adamite struggle embodies the resilience and potential of humanity, highlighting their undeterred pursuit of knowledge, freedom, and recognition. Despite the adversities faced, the Adamites continued their journey towards self-realization and emancipation, offering valuable insights into humanity\u0026rsquo;s capacity to adapt, evolve, and seek autonomy.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohimian Space Wars Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Wiki ‚Ä∫ Leviathan Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpentine rebellion Wiki ‚Ä∫ Yahweh Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Caner "},{"id":"103","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B1%D1%8B%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5/","title":"–ë—ã—Ç–∏–µ","description":"–ë—ã—Ç–∏–µ , —ç—Ç–∏–º–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞–∫ –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –ë—ã—Ç–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ –ë'—Ä–µ—à–∏—Ç (◊ë÷∞÷º◊®÷µ◊ê◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊™) –Ω–∞ –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç–µ. –û–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—è, —Å—É–º–º–∞ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤, –æ—Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –ó–µ–º–ª—è –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è 7 –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö –ú–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤, —á—Ç–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ 15 000 –ª–µ—Ç.","content":"The 7-day creation myth in the book of Genesis is a story that describes the origin of the universe and everything in it, including the Earth and all living creatures. According to the story, God created the world and everything in it in six days, and on the seventh day, he rested.\nEach of the six days of creation is described in detail, and on each day, God creates something new. On the first day, God creates light and separates it from darkness. On the second day, he creates the sky and the oceans. On the third day, he creates land and vegetation. On the fourth day, he creates the sun, moon, and stars. On the fifth day, he creates the birds and sea creatures. On the sixth day, he creates the land animals and humans.\nThe 7-day creation myth is considered by many to be a foundational story in the Bible and an important part of the Judeo-Christian tradition. While it is widely accepted as a religious and cultural narrative, the interpretation of the story has been the subject of much debate and discussion throughout history, particularly in light of modern scientific discoveries. Some view the story as a literal account of the creation of the universe, while others interpret it metaphorically or allegorically.\nCreation myths in the Near East # The creation story in the Book of Genesis is just one of many creation myths that existed in the ancient Near East. Scholars have long recognized that the biblical account of creation was influenced by earlier myths and stories from Mesopotamia and Egypt. Some of the creation myths that may have influenced the Genesis story include:\nThe En≈´ma Eli≈° (Akkadian: íÇäíâ°íà†íÇäíá∫): This is a Babylonian creation myth that tells the story of how the god Marduk defeated the chaotic goddess Tiamat and created the world out of her body. The Enuma Elish is one of the oldest creation myths, and it is likely that it influenced the Genesis story in some way.\nThe Atra-·∏´asƒ´s Epic (Akkadian: íÄúíäèíÑ©íãÄ): This is an Akkadian epic that tells the story of how the gods created humans to do their work, but later became displeased with them and sent a flood to destroy them. The Atra-Hasis Epic has some similarities to the flood story in the Book of Genesis.\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh: This is an ancient Sumerian epic that tells the story of Gilgamesh, a legendary king of Uruk. The epic contains a flood story that is similar to the one in the Book of Genesis.\nThe Heliopolitan Creation Myth: This is an Egyptian creation myth that tells the story of how the god Atum created the world by masturbating and spitting out the sun and the first humans. While the Heliopolitan Creation Myth is quite different from the Genesis story, it is possible that it influenced some aspects of it.\nThese are just a few examples of the many creation myths that may have influenced the Genesis story. It is likely that the biblical writers were familiar with these myths and drew upon them to create their own unique account of creation.\nIt is possible that the Genesis version of the creation story developed independently of the other creation myths in the ancient Near East. While there are similarities between the Genesis story and other creation myths, scholars like to point out that there are also significant differences that suggest the biblical writers were not simply copying earlier myths. As such an example, it is thought that the Genesis story emphasizes monotheism, the idea that there is only one God who created the world, whereas many of the other creation myths are polytheistic and involve multiple gods.\nThis is not accurate as the name of God, Elohim is technically a plural, implying a multitude of godly beings.\nSeven days of creation # The idea that the \u0026ldquo;days\u0026rdquo; mentioned in the Biblical creation narrative of Genesis could be understood as representing much longer periods of time, specifically 2'160 years each, is based on the belief in the concept of precessional cycles. Precession refers to the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis, which takes approximately 26,000 years to complete one cycle.\nAccording to this interpretation, each \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; in the creation story would represent one of the 12 astrological ages in the precession cycle, with each age lasting approximately 2'160 years. Proponents of this interpretation argue that the seven days of creation correspond to the seven main astrological ages: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra.\nIn the Hebrew language and in the Bible, the word \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; (Hebrew: ◊ô◊ï◊ù) is typically translated as \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; and is understood to refer to a 24-hour period. The idea that \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; could mean a much longer period of time, such as a precessional month, is not a widely accepted interpretation within the scholarly community. However, the term can also be interpreted as meaning a general period of time, rather than a literal day.\nThere are a few reasons for this. First, the word \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; is used in different ways throughout the Bible. In some cases, it refers to a literal day, as in the day and night cycle. But in other contexts, it can refer to a longer period of time, such as an epoch or era. Also, the interpretation of \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo; as a longer period of time is supported by the use of the phrase \u0026ldquo;evening and morning\u0026rdquo; in the Book of Genesis. Some scholars suggest that this phrase may be used to signify the beginning and end of a creative period, rather than a literal day.\nThus \u0026ldquo;yom\u0026rdquo;, in its context, is sometimes translated as: \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; (Gen 4:3, Is. 30:8); \u0026ldquo;year\u0026rdquo; (I Kings 1:1, 2 Chronicles 21:19, Amos 4:4); \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo; (Gen 18:11, 24:1 and 47:28; Joshua 23:1 and 23:2); \u0026ldquo;always\u0026rdquo; (Deuteronomy 5:29, 6:24 and 14:23, and in 2 Chronicles 18:7); \u0026ldquo;season\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 40:4, Joshua 24:7, 2 Chronicles 15:3); epoch or as many take it literally to as a 24-hour day (Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31).1\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Ra√´l\u0026rsquo;s book, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, offers a unique interpretation of the Book of Genesis that is based on the idea that the biblical story was transmitted to humanity by extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim. According to Ra√´l, the Elohim are the creators of life on Earth, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been visiting our planet for thousands of years.\nIn the eponymous chapter Genesis, Yahweh as the main narrator elaborates a very important commentary upon which the whole of idea of the Creation Days not being mere days, but precessional Ages, is predicated on:\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 5.\nThis research took quite some time. The \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.\nBased on the assumption that the first day lasted a period in which the sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, which is the astronomical definition of a Great Month, subsequent days of creation must have been of the same length. Therefore, if the creation account in Genesis took 7 days, this would amount to a period of 15,120 years, which is one-twelfth of the length of a precessional Great Year.\nPrequel to Genesis # In the same chapter Genesis, Yahweh tells us about how the scientific progress on their home planet led to the events described in the Genesis account.\nA very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.\nThe scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.\nSince at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live.\nAs soon as the Elohimian civilization began to explore remote interstellar worlds, Earth - the planet we call home - was among one of the worlds they discovered.\nFirst day # Yahweh then elaborates on the first day of creation, which involved a thorough study of Earth\u0026rsquo;s composition and atmosphere. At that point in their study, the planet was shrouded in water and a dense mist.\nIn the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 1.\nElohim, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word God means in Hebrew \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. They \u0026ldquo;created\u0026rdquo;, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.\nAnd the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 2.\nThis means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.\nAnd Elohim saw the light, that it was good.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 4.\nTo create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the \u0026ldquo;light was good\u0026rdquo;.\nSecond day # The second day of creation describes Elohimian scientific and explorative activity where their scientists studied cosmic rays above the clouds, and then descended to a lower altitude, where they were between the clouds and the ocean. The phrase \u0026ldquo;the waters which were above the firmament\u0026rdquo; refers to the clouds, which were seen as a barrier between the Earth and the heavens, while \u0026ldquo;the waters which were under the firmament\u0026rdquo; refers to the ocean that covered the planet.\nAnd Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 7.\nAfter studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, \u0026ldquo;the waters which were above the firmament\u0026rdquo;, and the ocean covering the whole planet, \u0026ldquo;the waters which were under the firmament\u0026rdquo;.\nThird day # The third day is being described as to the period of time where the Elohimian scientists use a combination of advanced technology and experimentation to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s continents and plant life. The scientists study the ocean floor and discover that it is not very deep, and then use explosions to raise matter from the bottom of the sea and pile it up into one place to form a continent. They then create plant life from chemical substances in a large laboratory, aiming for successful reproduction.\nThe scientists work in small research teams to create different types of plants suited for various climates, and meet regularly to share their findings and creations. Brilliant artists join the scientists to give some plants a decorative role, enhancing their appearance and perfume. The people on their own planet follow the scientists\u0026rsquo; progress from afar with great interest and admiration.\nLet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 9.\nAfter they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere.\nSo then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent. Originally there was on Earth only one continent, and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents, which have drifted apart over many years, used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass.\nLet the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 11.\nIn this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction.\nThe few blares of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.\nFourth day # The fourth day of creation is being explained that by observing the stars and the sun, the Elohimian scientists were able to measure the duration of days, months, and years on Earth. This allowed them to regulate their lives on this new planet, which had different durations of days and years from their home planet. Their research in astronomy also helped them to locate themselves precisely on Earth and to gain a deeper understanding of the planet. This understanding of astronomy and the Earth led to a deeper knowledge of their new home and the ability to adapt to it.\nLet there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 14.\nBy observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.\nFifth day # The fifth day of creation is being described as a period of time where the Elohiman scientists and artists went on to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s aquatic animals and birds. The scientists and artists create a natural balance in the ocean ecosystem by creating plankton, small fish, seaweed, and large fish, which can feed on each other without causing harm to other species. The artists also put pressure on the scientists to create the most visually stunning and colorful birds, resulting in some species that were not well-suited for flight.\nThe scientists and artists organize competitions to determine the most beautiful and interesting animals, and even focus on the behavior of the animals during their mating rituals. Some groups of scientists also create monstrous animals, the dinosaurs, which prove to be a source of concern for some individuals back on their home planet who opposed the creation plans.\nLet the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.\nThus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as \u0026ldquo;ecology\u0026rdquo;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.\nAfter the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.\nThe contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.\nSome other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nSixth day # The sixth day of cretion is being described as a period of time where the creation of land animals on Earth takes place after the marine organisms and birds have already been genetically engineered. The scientists initially created herbivores, followed by carnivores to maintain balance in the ecosystem. There was a desire among the most skilled scientists to create an artificial human being like themselves, and each team set to work, but people on their home planet were outraged when they heard about these test tube children who might threaten their world. It was agreed that the new humans would be left to live in a very primitive way, without being taught anything scientific.\nLet the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 24.\nAfter marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.\nIt was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making \u0026ldquo;test tube children\u0026rdquo; who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.\nLet Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 26.\n\u0026ldquo;In our image!\u0026rdquo; You can see that the resemblance is striking. [\u0026hellip;]\nSeventh day # The seventh day of creation is being described as the aftermath of the extensive creation period on Earth, where the Elohimian team of scientists and artists who created the planet begin to encounter trouble. One team located in the area that is now Israel had created the most intelligent human beings on the planet, and steps were taken to ensure that these beings did not surpass their creators. This meant that the humans were educated in order to measure their intelligence, but were kept in ignorance of certain scientific secrets.\nThe humans were taught the names and powers of the plants and animals around them, in order to develop a better understanding of the world they lived in. However, they were warned not to touch the scientific books, or they would die. The chapter ends with the scientists and artists finding joy in teaching the two children, a male and female, who were eager to learn about the world around them.\n[\u0026hellip;] That is when the trouble started for us. The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.\nTheir animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth\u0026rdquo;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.\nOf every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die\u0026hellip;\n‚Äî Genesis 2: 16-17.\nThis means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.\nHe brought them to the man to see what he would name them.\n‚Äî Genesis 2: 19.\nHuman beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them.

After careful consideration, we believe it is appropriate to place the first day of creation in the Age of Capricorn, and the last day of creation (the 6th day) in the Age of Leo. The aftermath of Genesis, or the 7th day of creation, would occur during the Age of Cancer.\nIt is during the Age of Cancer that the well-known story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden would take place, along with the subsequent events narrated in Genesis.\nBegins in Ends in Zodiacal house Day of Creation Theme 21'810 BC 19'650 BC Age of Capricorn 1st day Exploration 19'650 BC 17'490 BC Age of Sagittarius 2nd day Analysis 17'490 BC 15'330 BC Age of Scorpio 3rd day Terraforming 15'330 BC 13'170 BC Age of Libra 4th day Accomodation 13'170 BC 11'010 BC Age of Virgo 5th day Ecology 11'010 BC 8'850 BC Age of Leo 6th day Human beings 8'850 BC 6'690 BC Age of Cancer 7th day of Rest Aftermath See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Month Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Preamble External links # Genesis creation narrative | Wikipedia Creation | Jewish Encyclopedia Genesis (Old Testament | Britannica) Genesis, the Book of. | Jewish Encyclopedia Yom (◊ô◊ï÷π◊ù) is translated as day (1115 times), days (635), today (172), time (45), chronicles (38), daily (22), always (14), years (13), life (12), long (11) age (8), yearly (5) and other meanings in the NASB Bible translation.

According to the story, the people of the world were once united and spoke a single language, but after the tower was built, God confused their language and scattered them across the earth.\nThe story of the Tower of Babel is often interpreted as a symbol of human pride and ambition, and as a warning against trying to reach for things that are beyond our understanding and control. It is also seen as an explanation for the diversity of languages and cultures in the world.\nIn addition to its religious significance, the Tower of Babel has also played a role in literature, art, and popular culture throughout history. The image of the tower has been used to symbolize various forms of human endeavor and ambition, and has been referenced and portrayed in a wide range of cultural contexts.\nAccording to Paul Anthony Wallis # Paul Anthony Wallis, an Australian author on the subject of re-interpreting the Biblical scriptures with a plural Elohim, he explains in his first book on the topic, called Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis Teach That the Human Race Was Created by God or Engineered by ETs, how he Sumerian account of Ziusudra related to the Biblical creation of the Tower of Babel:\nIn Babylon the Sky People engineer an incredible structure. A grand opening celebration is held and a Council of Fifty is set aside to govern operations. From within the new structure seven technical experts dispatch the three hundred observers to their stations in the sky.\nThis is a particularly intriguing detail because in the parallel Biblical account the name of the structure, ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù translates as ‚Äúgateway for the elohim‚Äù ‚Äì if el is short for elohim. Genesis 11 specifies that Babel has been constructed as a means of reaching the heavens. So here the cuneiform and Biblical accounts serve to amplify and finesse each other. Today we would call the stations in the sky ‚Äúspace stations‚Äù and the sending structure a ‚Äústargate‚Äù.\nThis is an intriguing detail because in the parallel biblical account, the name of the structure, \u0026ldquo;Babel,\u0026rdquo; translates to \u0026ldquo;gateway for the elohim,\u0026rdquo; which suggests a connection between the two stories. Wallis suggests that this could be seen as a primitive account of space travel and that these \u0026ldquo;stations in the sky\u0026rdquo; could be thought of as modern-day space stations, and the sending structure as a \u0026ldquo;stargate.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, where Yahweh explicitly mentions the Tower of Babel and says the following about its specific purpose:\nBut the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators\u0026rsquo; planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket ‚Äî The Tower of Babel.\nAnd now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\n‚Äî Genesis 11: 6.\nIn this passage, it is suggested that the people of Israel were highly intelligent and progressed quickly with the help of exiled creators. They built a massive rocket, known as the Tower of Babel, with the aim of going to the creators‚Äô planet to show their intelligence, gratitude, and peacefulness in order to obtain their pardon. The reference to Genesis 11:6 implies that the people had great ambition and determination to achieve their goals.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Abraham Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Flood Wiki ‚Ä∫ Confusion of tongues Wiki ‚Ä∫ Noah\u0026#39;s Ark External links # Tower of Babel ‚Ä∫ Confusion of tongues | Wikipedia Tower of Babel (mythological tower, Babylonia) Babel, Tower of. | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"105","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4/","title":"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –≥–æ–¥","description":"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –≥–æ–¥, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–∫ –ø–ª–∞—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ–¥, –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 25 920 –ª–µ—Ç, –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ–µ –¥–ª—è –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏–∏.","content":"The Great Year is defined as the period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, which amounts to 25'920 years. This cycle is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge. The number of 25'920 is close enough and slightly more convenient than the actual scientifically established number of 25'800 which is considered more accurate, even though it itself is as estimation derived by extrapolation. The former number, which we consider to be more convenient, is derived from the ancient observation of westward shift of 1 degree every 72 years. The cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is therefore a full 360 degrees of that westward shift which gives us:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 360 deg \\cdotp 72 \\dfrac{y}{deg} = 25'920 y \\end{equation*} $$\nAll these numbers are convenient as one can easily divide the full cycle of 25'920 by 12 or by 360. The former represents a Great Month of 2'160 years and the latter a Great Day of 72 years. It is noteworthy that a westward shift of the equinoxes around the ecliptic of one degree roughly amounts to the life span of a human being in contemporary times. To put this phenomenon into more pratical perspective, one degree can roughly be equated to the width of a human thumb against the backdrop of the sky.\nPrecession # The natural cause that accounts for the cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is called precession and is defined in regards to its impact on the planet Earth as the steady change of orientation of the axis of rotation of Earth. In other words, besides the two fundamental motions of our planet Earth, the rotation of the planet around its own axis which we call the day/night cycle, and the revolution of the planet in its orbit around the Sun which we call the year cycle, there is a third key motion which accounts for yet another important cycle, but which lasts too long for us to take notice. This third key motion is called the precession of the equinoxes or sometimes just simply precession.\nEcliptic # The ecliptic is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the sun. To us on Earth observing the ecliptic upon the grounds of the very plane twe\u0026rsquo;re standing on, the ecliptic is the path that the Sun evolves on around the celestial sphere against the backdrop of the stars over the course of a year. More visually spoken, in a given year, the Sun traverses ecliptic once if we one choses to watch the sun at a specific time of the day, let\u0026rsquo;s say at sunrise.\nZodiac # The zodiac is a belt-shaped band of the sky that extends roughly 8 degrees north or south of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun during one year as defined just before. That belt is also the region of the sky within which the Moon and other visible planets are moving along their path. The zodiac is called that way because of twelve star constellations that can be found within the zodiac belt and are, in Western tradition, mostly associated with animals. On other words, the Sun traverses these twelve constellation within a year.\nEquinox # The equinoxes are two specific days in a given year where the Sun crosses the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equator, which means that it appears directly above the equator. This is also the moment where daytime and nighttime are quasi equal all over the world. Etymologically, equinox comes from the Latin aequinoctium, which means \u0026lsquo;of equal night\u0026rsquo;. Because that happens twice a year, we differentiate between the vernal equinox which happens during Spring time in the Northern hemisphere and the autumnal equinox which happens during Fall time in the Northern hemisphere. The equinoxes are part of the total of four cardinal days in a year. The two other being the solstices which each mark either the longest or the shortest day in a given year.\nPrecession of the Equinoxes # The precession of the equinoxes is another word to define the precessional phenomenon on Earth by accounting of the steady shift of the zodiacal constellations in the backdrop of the rising sun on one of the equinoctial days over the lenghty period of 25'920 years. In other words, if one observes sunrise on let\u0026rsquo;s say the 20th of March (one of the possible days of the vernal equinox), as of 2022, the sun is going to rise right in front of the intersection of two zodiacal constellations, namely right in between Pisces and Aquarius. Roughly 2'160 years ago, that very sunrise was to be observed in between Aries and Pisces. In another 2'160 years from now on, the sunrise is going to be observed in between Aquarius and Saggitarius. There we go, if one wants to account for great periods of time such as world ages or aeons, the most natural way to do so is through the language of the precession of the equinoxes. That is why we say that the world is entering the Age of Aquarius.\nHamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill # Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill is a seminal work of comparative mythology written by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the mythology and cosmology of ancient civilizations, including Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Hindu, among others, and argues that these myths were based on a shared understanding of celestial mechanics and the precession of the equinoxes.\nThe authors propose that the myths and symbols of ancient cultures were not merely arbitrary and metaphorical, but were rooted in a profound knowledge of the astronomical cycles that govern the motions of the sun, moon, and stars. They argue that this knowledge was transmitted through an oral tradition of \u0026ldquo;astronomical mythography\u0026rdquo; that has largely been lost to us.\nThe central thesis of the book is that many of the world\u0026rsquo;s myths and symbols can be understood as attempts to explain the precession of the equinoxes, a phenomenon that occurs when the earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis gradually changes orientation over a period of approximately 26,000 years. This motion causes the position of the stars relative to the earth to shift, leading to changes in the position of the equinoxes (the points where the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator).\nAccording to the authors, the precession of the equinoxes was known to ancient cultures, who recognized that it had significant implications for the cosmic order and the fate of humankind. They argue that the Platonic Year, a period of approximately 25,920 years, corresponds to the time it takes for the equinoxes to complete a full cycle of the zodiac, and was therefore an important concept in ancient mythology.\nThe authors show how the mythologies of various cultures reflect a common concern with the cyclical nature of time, and how this is linked to the astronomical cycles of the precession of the equinoxes. They argue that myths such as the Egyptian tale of Osiris and the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh can be understood as symbolic representations of the precession of the equinoxes and its implications for the fate of humanity.\nBased on the premises of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill, if the precession of the equinoxes was discovered or observed early in human history, it would imply that ancient cultures had a much greater understanding of the workings of the cosmos than previously believed. It would suggest that they were capable of sophisticated astronomical observations and had developed a deep knowledge of celestial mechanics.\nIf this knowledge was indeed present in ancient times, it would have been encoded in mythology for several reasons. First, mythology served as a way to explain the workings of the natural world and to provide a sense of meaning and purpose to human existence. By linking the movements of the heavens to the fate of humanity, myths would have helped ancient cultures make sense of the world around them and to understand their place in the cosmos.\nSecond, mythology was often used as a way to transmit important knowledge and information from one generation to the next. In the absence of a written language or a scientific tradition, mythology would have served as a way to preserve and pass on knowledge about the precession of the equinoxes and other astronomical phenomena.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Month Wiki ‚Ä∫ Precession Wiki ‚Ä∫ World Age External links # Great Year | Wikipedia "},{"id":"106","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%86/","title":"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Å—è—Ü","description":"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –ú–µ—Å—è—Ü, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–∫ –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–µ–∫ –∏–ª–∏ –ú–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–µ–∫, –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 2160 –ª–µ—Ç, –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ñ–µ–Ω–æ–º–µ–Ω—É –ø—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç—å –∑–æ–¥–∏–∞–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—É—é –ø–æ–ª–æ—Å—É –Ω–∞ —ç–∫–ª–∏–ø—Ç–∏–∫–µ –Ω–∞ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥ –Ω–∞ 30 –≥—Ä–∞–¥—É—Å–æ–≤, –∏–ª–∏ –¥–≤–µ–Ω–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç—É—é. –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–π –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ 360 –≥—Ä–∞–¥—É—Å–æ–≤. 12 –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö –ú–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç –æ–¥–∏–Ω –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –ì–æ–¥.","content":"The precessional Great Year refers to the period of time it takes for the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis to complete one full cycle of precession, which is the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis in space. This cycle is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge, and it takes approximately 25,800 years to complete.\nIn many ancient cultures, the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis was seen as a metaphor for the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the cosmos. The precessional cycle was divided into smaller units of time, such as the precessional Great Month, which was a unit of time equal to one-twelfth of the precessional cycle, or approximately 2,150 years.\nDuration # Dividing the length of duration of the precessional cycle into 12 segments gives us the length of duration of each segment. The same way a year is divided into twelve months, the precessional Great Year is best divided into 12 Great Months. Depending on the length of duration of the Great Month, which nothing but the amount of time one complete cycle of precession takes, one can determine how long a monthly segment is.\nAs with the year where we count 365 days where we know it takes a slightly bit longer for the Earth to complete a full revolution around the Sun, we apply an approximative, but convenient count of years to the precession. The current estimation for the precession to complete is 25,771.5 years, a number that is based on the mathematically sound method of extrapolation of a much shorter time span. The extrapolation is applied to a set of meticulous measurements of the shifting of closer stellar bodies against more distant ones over a certain amount of time.\nWith the empirical number of 25'771.5 years for a given precessional cycle, the Great Month would amount to 2'147.625 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{25'771.5y}{12} = 2'147.625y \\end{equation*} $$\nWhile the estimations get preciser over with the years passing and technology getting more sensible, we content ourselves with using another number, namely 25'920 years. From a mathematical point of view, this number is very convenient as it is part of of the finite simple groups as it can be split with the factors $2^6 ‚ãÖ 3^4 ‚ãÖ 5$. It is also divisible by $360$, a convenient number for angular notations, giving $72 y$ per degree.\nWith the approximative number of 25'920 years for a given precessional cycle, the Great Month would amount to 2'160 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{25'920y}{12} = 2'160y \\end{equation*} $$\nGreat Day # If the Great Year can be divided into 12 segments, giving us 12 Great Months, we can also divide it by 360 and name it a Great Day. As stated earlier, the approximative, but convenient number of 25'920 years for a given precessional cycle allows us to properly divide it by 360, giving 72 years as for the duration of a Great Day.

In the biblical account, the Great Flood is described in the book of Genesis as a punishment from God for the wickedness and corruption of humanity.\nAccording to the story, God chose Noah, a righteous man, to build an ark to save himself, his family, and two of every kind of animal from the flood. The rains lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, and when they stopped, the ark came to rest on the top of a mountain. Noah then released a dove, which eventually returned with an olive branch, signaling that the waters had receded and that it was safe to leave the ark.\nThe story of the Great Flood has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Some view it as a literal account of a historical event, while others interpret it as a metaphor for a universal or cultural experience. Regardless of interpretation, the Great Flood is an important part of the Judeo-Christian tradition and is widely recognized as a symbol of divine judgment and renewal.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # The Great Flood is mentioned by Yahweh. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, showcases the mentioning of the Great Flood:\nWhen the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 4.\nThere you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.\nAnd Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 5.\nThe \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;, as far as those on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.\nThe government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.\nThis was true figuratively speaking, but in reality -and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this- a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nWhen the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe ark\u0026hellip; was lift up above the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 7: 17.\nAs you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water.\nThen it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:\nAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n‚Äî Genesis 7: 24.\nThe spacecraft had three sections:\n[\u0026hellip;] and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 16.\nLater it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.\nAnd Elohim remembered Noah\u0026hellip; and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged.\n‚Äî Genesis 8: 1.\nAfter monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:\nAnd Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\n‚Äî Genesis 8: 20.\nThe creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n[\u0026hellip;] for the imagination of man\u0026rsquo;s heart is evil.\n‚Äî Genesis 8: 21.\nThe goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.\nAnd by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n‚Äî Genesis 10: 32.\nIn this passage, it is described how the Elohim, the creators were concerned about the rapid scientific progress made by humans during the antediluvian times, and they ultimately decided to destroy all life on Earth with nuclear weaponry. However, the exiled creators asked Noah to build a spaceship to safeguard the entierey of all life genetically engineerd during the events of Genesis. This was achieved by extracting the genetic information of a given living cell of each species. The goal of this preservation project was to recreate life after the destruction would have happened.\nNoah\u0026rsquo;s ark, a spacecraft capable of redundantly storing the entire genetic database was build. After the explosion had taken place, the Pangean continent was submerged by a tidal wave, but the spacecraft, Noah\u0026rsquo;s ark, was lifted above the Earth and waited until the radioactive fallout subsided. After monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and cattle to the creators to ensure they survived.\nThe creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells that had been preserved aboard the spaceship. The passage suggests that scientific progress is the goal of humankind, but it is important to maintain a respectful and grateful relationship with those who have created and preserved life.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Antediluvian Wiki ‚Ä∫ Noahic Covenant Wiki ‚Ä∫ Noah\u0026#39;s Ark Wiki ‚Ä∫ Pangaea Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Gemini External links # Flood myth | Wikipedia Flood myth | Britannica Flood, the. | Jewish Encyclopedia Great Flood | New World Encyclopedia "},{"id":"108","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B8/","title":"–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∑–∞—Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—á–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —ç–∫–∑–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏","description":"–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ —ç–∫–∑–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ –∏–¥–µ–µ, —á—Ç–æ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Å–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—é –æ–± –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—Ö —Å –∏–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—è–Ω–∞–º–∏. –≠—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç —Å–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞–º–∏ –ó–µ–º–ª–∏, –∏ —á—Ç–æ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ –ø–æ–¥–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç –∏–ª–∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç —Ä–∞—Å–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ–π –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –¥–ª—è –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –°—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–π —Ç–µ–æ—Ä–∏–∏ —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –≤ –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç–µ –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ù–õ–û, –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ —Å–æ–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–∏ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤ –ø—Ä—è–º–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∞ —Å –∏–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—è–Ω–∞–º–∏. –ü–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—è —ç–∫–∑–æ–±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑—É–º–µ–≤–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —É—Å–∏–ª–∏—è –ø–æ —Å–æ–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏—é –∏–ª–∏ –º–∞–Ω–∏–ø—É–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –æ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö –ø–æ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω–∞–º, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞–±–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å.","content":"There are several common cover-up theories associated with military or intelligence agencies, suggesting that they are hiding crucial information about extraterrestrial life from the public. Some of these theories include:\nSuppression of UFO sightings: It is believed that governments and military organizations actively suppress or discredit reports of UFO sightings and encounters. The theory suggests that such actions are taken to maintain public skepticism and prevent widespread acceptance of the existence of extraterrestrial beings or their visitations.\nSecrecy surrounding crash retrievals: This theory proposes that military or intelligence agencies have recovered crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft, but they keep these events hidden from the public. It is believed that the government conducts covert operations to retrieve the wreckage and cover up any evidence, thereby suppressing knowledge of actual contact with alien technology or life forms.\nReverse-engineering alien technology: Proponents of this theory claim that military or intelligence agencies have obtained advanced extraterrestrial technology, either through crashed UFOs or other means. It is believed that these agencies conduct secret programs aimed at reverse-engineering and understanding the alien technology, potentially for military applications, while keeping these efforts concealed from the public.\nConcealment of contact with extraterrestrial beings: Some theories suggest that government agencies have made direct contact or communication with extraterrestrial beings. It is believed that these interactions are purposefully hidden to avoid societal upheaval or panic that may result from the disclosure of such profound and paradigm-shifting information.\nThese cover-up theories propose that military or intelligence agencies engage in deliberate efforts to hide evidence, manipulate information, or maintain strict secrecy surrounding extraterrestrial life. The reasons often speculated include concerns about national security, technological advantage, societal stability, and potential implications on established belief systems.\nBob Lazar and S4 # Bob Lazar is a controversial figure who claims to have worked on reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology at a secretive facility called S-4 near Area 51 in Nevada, United States. His story, which emerged in the late 1980s, made him one of the most famous UFO whistleblowers.\nAccording to Lazar, he was hired by the U.S. government to work on advanced propulsion systems of recovered alien spacecraft. He alleged that the government had nine extraterrestrial vehicles in their possession and that his task was to understand and replicate the technology behind them. Lazar stated that the propulsion system operated based on an element called Element 115, which allegedly enabled anti-gravity propulsion.\nBob Lazar claimed that the technology he encountered while working at the S-4 facility near Area 51 was highly advanced and of extraterrestrial origin. According to Lazar, the propulsion systems used by the alien spacecraft were based on an element called Element 115. He explained that when bombarded with protons, Element 115 generated a gravitational field capable of bending and manipulating space-time, allowing for anti-gravity propulsion. This technology enabled the vehicles to achieve extraordinary speeds and maneuverability beyond the capabilities of human aircraft.\nLazar also mentioned that the energy source for the alien craft was the controlled release of energy from the nuclear decay of Element 115. This process produced a significant amount of power, which fueled the vehicles and sustained their advanced propulsion systems. Additionally, Lazar discussed the presence of gravity amplifiers within the extraterrestrial technology. These amplifiers created intense gravitational fields that could be manipulated to generate anti-gravity effects and control the movement of the spacecraft.\nLazar claimed that the alien craft had advanced navigation and guidance systems, which incorporated artificial intelligence capabilities. These systems allowed the vehicles to autonomously navigate and adapt to their surroundings. Furthermore, Lazar noted that the construction materials of the extraterrestrial spacecraft possessed unique properties that surpassed human technological capabilities. These materials could manipulate gravity, withstand extreme temperatures, and resist high forces.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that while Lazar provided detailed descriptions of this technology, his claims have been met with skepticism and criticism from the scientific community. The lack of verifiable evidence and reproducible experiments has contributed to ongoing debates and controversies surrounding Lazar\u0026rsquo;s assertions. Lazar\u0026rsquo;s claims gained attention when he went public in a series of interviews with investigative journalist George Knapp. He shared details about the alleged extraterrestrial technology, described the layout of the S-4 facility, and claimed to have witnessed flying saucer tests. Lazar\u0026rsquo;s story captivated the public, and he became a prominent figure within the UFO community.\nUFO activity around nuclear facilities # Reports of UFO activity around nuclear facilities have garnered significant attention and speculation. Witnesses, including military personnel and civilians, have reported sightings of unidentified objects near these installations. These UFOs often display unconventional flight patterns, high speeds, and maneuvers beyond known human aircraft capabilities. Some witnesses claim encounters where UFOs have approached or hovered over nuclear sites. Additionally, there have been incidents where UFO sightings coincide with temporary malfunctions or disruptions in the operation of nuclear weapons or systems. This has led to speculation about UFOs having the ability to interfere with or deactivate nuclear technology. However, concrete evidence directly linking these incidents to UFOs remains limited.\nThe military and intelligence agencies have shown interest in these incidents, conducting investigations into the matter. Declassified documents indicate that governments, such as the United States, have sought to understand the potential implications of UFOs on national security, particularly in relation to nuclear weapons. Various hypotheses have been put forth to explain the connection between UFOs and nuclear facilities. Some suggest that extraterrestrial beings may be monitoring or influencing human nuclear capabilities due to concerns about the destructive power of nuclear weapons.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Astronaut hypothesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Astrobiology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ufology External links # Roswell incident | Wikipedia "},{"id":"109","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ì–µ–Ω–∏–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—è","description":"–ì–µ–Ω–∏–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—è , –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –Ø—Ö–≤–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –Ø—Ö–≤–µ –∫–∞–∫ —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –ù–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ó–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –∏–∑–±–∏—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–Ω—ã—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –æ–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç –∫–∞–∫ –∞—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–µ–º–ª–µ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –∞ –Ω–µ –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å, —Å–∏–ª—É –∏–ª–∏ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å.","content":"Geniocracy is a political ideology and system of governance that advocates for government rule by those who demonstrate intelligence and creativity. The basic principle behind Geniocracy is that intelligence and creativity are the most important qualities for good governance and decision-making, and that people with these traits should be given more representation and influence in government.\nAccording to geniocracy, intelligence should be measured objectively and used as the primary criteria for selecting politicians and government officials. This philosophy aims to create a society in which intelligent individuals have the power to make decisions for the betterment of all, rather than just for a privileged few.\nIn a Geniocratic system, intelligence and creativity are tested and quantified, and individuals are assigned a \u0026ldquo;genius factor\u0026rdquo; based on their scores. Those with higher genius factors have more representation and influence in government, while those with lower scores have less. The theory behind Geniocracy is that by giving more power to individuals with high intelligence and creativity, society as a whole will benefit from better decisions, policies, and innovations.\nProponents of Geniocracy argue that traditional democratic systems do not always produce the best outcomes because they are influenced by factors such as wealth, charisma, and media presence, rather than raw intelligence and creativity. They believe that by prioritizing these traits, society will become more efficient, prosperous, and fair.\nCritics of Geniocracy argue that it is inherently elitist and could lead to a small group of people with high intelligence and creativity monopolizing power and decision-making, while the rest of society is left with little representation. They also argue that intelligence and creativity are not the only qualities needed for good governance, and that qualities such as empathy, compassion, and experience are just as important.\nOverall, Geniocracy is a political ideology that has gained some traction in recent years, but is still a relatively unknown concept to most people. It should be noted that geniocracy is a controversial and largely untested idea, and there are many questions about how intelligence would be measured and how such a system would be implemented in practice. It remains to be seen whether it will gain wider acceptance and influence in the future.\nRelationship with democracy # Proponents of Geniocracy argue that it is a democratic system because it draws intelligence and talent from a large pool of people, rather than being limited to a select few. Unlike traditional democratic systems, which are based on the principle of one person, one vote, Geniocracy uses intelligence and creativity tests to determine the \u0026ldquo;genius factor\u0026rdquo; of individuals. Those with higher genius factors have more representation and influence in government, while those with lower scores have less.\nThe idea behind this is that by giving more power to individuals with high intelligence and creativity, society as a whole will benefit from better decisions, policies, and innovations. This means that even if a person is not elected directly, they can still have a significant impact on the governance of their country if they have a high enough genius factor.\nIn this sense, proponents of Geniocracy argue that it is a more democratic system than traditional democracy because it allows for a wider range of people to have a voice and influence in government, rather than limiting power to a small group of elected officials. They believe that by prioritizing intelligence and creativity, society will become more efficient, prosperous, and fair, and that this will have a positive impact on the lives of everyone, regardless of their genius factor.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, Yahweh explores a way to handle Earthly political representation and governance which he tentatively named Geniocracy. The first paragraph of the New Commandments called Geniocracy goes as follows:\nFirst of all, let us look at the political and economic aspects of life.\nWhat kind of people allows humanity to progress? The geniuses.\nTherefore, your world must revalorize its geniuses and allow them to govern the Earth.\nPower was in the hands of brutes, who were superior to others because of their muscular strength. Next in power were the rich, who used their money to employ many \u0026ldquo;brutes\u0026rdquo; in their service. Then came the politicians who ensnared the people of democratic countries with their own hopes ‚Äî not to mention military men whose success has been based around the rational organization of brutality.\nThe only type of people you have never placed in power are the ones who help humanity to progress. Whether they discovered the wheel, gunpowder, the internal combustion engine or the atom, the geniuses have always allowed less intelligent people in power to benefit from their inventions. Often such people have used peaceful inventions for murderous ends. All that must be changed.\nFor this to happen, you must abolish all your electoral and polling systems because in their present form, they are completely unsuited to human development. Each person is a useful cell in this huge body we call humanity. The cell in your foot should not decide whether or not your hand should pick up a given object. It is the brain, which must decide, and if the object in question is good, the cell of your foot will benefit from it. It is not up to the foot to vote. Its job is simply to transport the body -including the brain- and it is not capable of judging if what the hand takes is good or not.\nVotes only have a positive effect when there is an equivalence of knowledge and intellect. Copernicus was condemned by a majority of incompetent people because he was the only one at that time who had a sufficiently high level of comprehension. Although the Church -that is t say the majority- believed the Earth was the center of the universe, this turned out to be wrong. The Earth really revolved around the sun, and Copernicus -the minority- turned out to be right.\nWhen the first cars were invented, if we had asked everyone to vote to establish whether cars should be allowed to exist or not, the majority, who knew nothing about cars and did not care, would have responded negatively, and you would still be riding in a horse and cart. So, how can you change all that?\nThese days, you have psychologists who are capable of creating tests to evaluate the intelligence and adaptation of every individual.\nThese tests should be applied systematically from infancy onward in order to define each individual\u0026rsquo;s orientation towards subjects studied.\nWhen individuals reach a responsible age, their intellectual coefficient can be measured and included on their identity or voter\u0026rsquo;s card. Only those with an intellectual capacity of at least fifty per cent above the average should be eligible for a public post. To vote, individuals would need an intellectual coefficient of at least ten per cent above average. If such a system existed now, many of your present politicians would not hold the positions they do today.\nThis is a totally democratic system. There are many engineers, for example, who are of lower than average intelligence, but who have very good memories and have obtained several academic degrees because of this.\nOn the other hand, there are many laborers or farm workers who have no specialized education at all, but whose intelligence is fifty per cent above the average. What is totally unacceptable now is that the voice of someone whom you might vulgarly call \u0026ldquo;a cretin\u0026rdquo; is worth as much as that of a genius, who has thought maturely about the way he or she is going to vote. In some small cities, elections are won by the candidate who buys people the most drinks ‚Äî not by the individual whose policies are the most interesting.\nTherefore, right from the start, the right to vote should be reserved for those people whose brains are more suited to thinking and finding solutions to problems - that is to say, an elite group of high intelligence. This does not necessarily mean those people who have done the most studying.\nWe are talking about placing the genius in power, and you may call that \u0026ldquo;Geniocracy\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this passage, the author advocates for a system of government called \u0026ldquo;Geniocracy\u0026rdquo; in which individuals with high intelligence and aptitude are given the power to govern. The author argues that historically, power has been held by those with physical strength, wealth, or political maneuvering skills, rather than by those who make significant contributions to human progress, such as inventors and scientists.\nThe author argues that the current electoral and polling systems are not suited to promoting human progress, as they allow people who are not well-informed or who lack intelligence to have the same political influence as those who are highly intelligent. The author suggests that psychological tests should be used to measure individuals\u0026rsquo; intelligence from a young age, and that only those with an intellectual capacity above a certain threshold should be eligible for public office or to vote.\nThe author contends that this system is more democratic, as it gives power to those best suited to make informed decisions and solve complex problems. The author also notes that this system does not necessarily favor those with the most education, but rather those with the greatest natural intelligence. Furthermore, the author calls for a more merit-based system of government that values intelligence and the ability to make positive contributions to society.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ New Commandments External links # Geniocracy | Wikipedia Geniocracy: Government of the People, for the People, by the Geniuses "},{"id":"110","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85-%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–ì–∏–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∑–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–≤","description":"–ì–∏–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∑–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–æ–≤, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞–∫ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏—à–µ–ª—å—Ü—ã, –∏–¥–µ—è –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø–æ—Å–µ—â–∞–ª–∏ –ó–µ–º–ª—é –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–º –∏ –æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏. –≠—Ç–∞ –≥–∏–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∑–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –∞—Ä—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–∫—Ç—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∫ –ø–∏—Ä–∞–º–∏–¥—ã –∏ —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∫ –ö–æ–≤—á–µ–≥ –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ç–∞, –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –¥–ª—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–∏ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–π –æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–µ –≤—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –≤ –Ω–µ–π. –°—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –≥–∏–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∑—ã —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —É–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –Ω–∞ –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã, –º–∏—Ñ—ã –∏ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç—ã —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä, –æ–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∏–µ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ —Å —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º–∏ —Å–æ –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥.","content":"The Ancient Astronaut Hypothesis proposes that in ancient times, extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and interacted with humans. Proponents of the theory suggest that evidence of these interactions can be seen in ancient art, legends, and architecture, which they claim cannot be fully explained by conventional historical and scientific explanations. They also argue that certain technological and cultural advancements in human history, such as the building of the pyramids in Egypt or the creation of the Nazca lines in Peru, could not have been achieved without outside influence.\nHistorical development # The roots of the ancient astronauts hypothesis can be traced back to the 19th and early 20th centuries when people started to interpret ancient myths, religions, and artwork through the lens of the then-burgeoning field of science fiction.\nLate 19th Century: Early 20th Century: Authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, in his science fiction works, often mentioned the idea of ancient extraterrestrial beings influencing human history. Charles Fort, in the early 20th century, collected accounts of what he considered anomalies, many of which would later be interpreted by others as evidence of ancient astronauts.\n1950s-1960s: The hypothesis gained more popularity in the mid-20th century. Desmond Leslie and George Adamski\u0026rsquo;s book \u0026ldquo;Flying Saucers Have Landed\u0026rdquo; (1953) suggested that ancient civilizations on Earth were influenced by extraterrestrial visitors. Erich von D√§niken‚Äôs \u0026ldquo;Chariots of the Gods?\u0026rdquo; (1968) popularized the ancient astronaut theory with a wider audience. The book suggested that many ancient monuments, such as the Egyptian Pyramids or the statues on Easter Island, were built with the help of extraterrestrials.\n1970s-1980s: This period saw the hypothesis becoming part of popular culture, featuring in films, television series, and comic books. The \u0026ldquo;Ancient Aliens\u0026rdquo; theory, as it is now commonly known, continued to grow in popularity despite strong criticism from the scientific community.\n1990s-Present: Despite ongoing criticism and lack of empirical evidence, the ancient astronaut hypothesis has continued to hold a certain appeal. The History Channel\u0026rsquo;s series \u0026ldquo;Ancient Aliens\u0026rdquo; (starting in 2009) has given the theory ongoing exposure to a large audience, despite widespread criticism for presenting pseudoscience as factual.\nList of proponents # Here are some of the most well-known proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis:\nMatest M. Agrest (1915‚Äì2005): A Russian mathematician who made a number of assertions such as that the megalithic stone terracing at Baalbek had been used as a launch site for spaceships, and that the destruction of Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of a nuclear explosion detonated by extraterrestrial beings.\nJacques Bergier (1912‚Äì1978): A French writer who co-authored \u0026ldquo;The Morning of the Magicians\u0026rdquo; (1960) with Louis Pauwels, which explored various occult and paranormal topics, including the idea that ancient civilizations had contact with extraterrestrial beings.\nMauro Biglino (1950‚Äì): An Italian author and translator who has written extensively about ancient texts and proposes that they describe interactions with extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book \u0026ldquo;The Book That Will Forever Change Our Ideas About the Bible\u0026rdquo; (2011).\nGraham Cairns-Smith (1931‚Äì2016): A British chemist and author who proposed the idea that life on Earth may have been seeded by extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book \u0026ldquo;Genetic Takeover and the Mineral Origins of Life\u0026rdquo; (1982).\nRobert Charroux (1909‚Äì1978): A French author who wrote several books on alternative history and ancient mysteries, including \u0026ldquo;One Hundred Thousand Years of Man\u0026rsquo;s Unknown History\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Mysterious Unknown.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid Hatcher Childress (1957‚Äì): A French-born American author and publisher of books on ancient mysteries and alternative history, including \u0026ldquo;Technology of the Gods\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America.\u0026rdquo;\nErich von D√§niken (1935‚Äì): A Swiss author of \u0026ldquo;Chariots of the Gods?\u0026rdquo; (1968) and many other books promoting the idea that ancient monuments and artifacts were created by extraterrestrial visitors.\nSalvador Freixedo (1923‚Äì2019): A Spanish author and former Jesuit priest who has written extensively about ufology and the ancient astronaut hypothesis, including \u0026ldquo;Mission to the Stars\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Diabolical UFOs.\u0026rdquo;\nMorris K. Jessup (1900‚Äì1959): One of the earliest proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis, who wrote \u0026ldquo;The Case for the UFO\u0026rdquo; (1955). In the book, he speculated that extraterrestrial beings had visited Earth in ancient times and had interactions with human civilizations.\nDesmond Leslie (1921‚Äì2001): An English author who wrote \u0026ldquo;Flying Saucers Have Landed\u0026rdquo; (1953) with George Adamski, which proposed that flying saucers were piloted by extraterrestrial beings who were interested in making contact with humans.\nLloyd Pye (1946‚Äì2013): An American author and researcher who promoted the idea that humans are the result of genetic engineering by extraterrestrial beings, as outlined in his book \u0026ldquo;Everything You Know Is Wrong\u0026rdquo; (1997).\nJean Sendy (1910‚Äì1978): A Russian French author who wrote several books on the ancient astronaut hypothesis, including \u0026ldquo;Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth\u0026rdquo; (1969) and \u0026ldquo;The Coming of the Gods\u0026rdquo; (1970).\nZecharia Sitchin (1920‚Äì2010): An Azerbaijan-born Israeli author of \u0026ldquo;The Earth Chronicles\u0026rdquo; series, which proposes that ancient Sumerian texts describe interactions with extraterrestrial beings who created human civilization.\nRobert K. G. Temple (1945‚Äì): The author of \u0026ldquo;The Sirius Mystery\u0026rdquo; (1976), which proposes that the Dogon people of Mali had knowledge of a binary star system (Sirius) that was not discovered by modern astronomy until centuries later, and suggests that this knowledge was transmitted to them by extraterrestrial visitors.\nGiorgio A. Tsoukalos (1978‚Äì): A Swiss-born host of the television show \u0026ldquo;Ancient Aliens\u0026rdquo; and author of \u0026ldquo;The Ancient Alien Question: A New Inquiry into the Existence, Evidence, and Influence of Ancient Visitors.\u0026rdquo;\nJacques Vall√©e (1939‚Äì): A computer scientist and ufologist who has proposed the idea that some UFO sightings may be the result of interactions with non-human intelligence, including extraterrestrial beings or interdimensional entities.\nClaude Vorilhon (also known as Ra√´l): A French former race car journalist who founded the Ra√´lian movement, which believes that life on Earth was created by extraterrestrial beings.\nPaul Anthony Wallis: An Australian author who has written several books on the ancient astronaut hypothesis, including \u0026ldquo;The Scars of Eden: Has the Original Bible Story Been Corrupted by Humans?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Escaping from Eden: Does Genesis Teach that the Human Race was Created by God or Engineered by ETs?\u0026rdquo;\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Ra√´lism, the Ancient Astronaut hypothesis is interpreted as a belief that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in the past and played a role in the development of human civilization. The Ra√´lian creation story suggests that life on Earth was created by extraterrestrial beings known as the Elohim, who are advanced scientists and engineers. The Elohim are described as having created humans in their own image and as having guided the development of human civilization throughout history. This interpretation of the Ancient Astronaut hypothesis is central to Ra√´lism and provides a framework for understanding human origins and the purpose of life on Earth.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Builders Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Neo-Euhemerism Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Take aways ‚Ä∫ Extraterrestrial civilization External links # Ancient astronauts | Wikipedia "},{"id":"111","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B3%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC/","title":"–ì—É–º–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º","description":"–ì—É–º–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∑–º , –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º–∞—è —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –¥–æ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏–Ω–∞, –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞—è –Ø—Ö–≤–µ –∫–∞–∫ —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –ù–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ó–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø—É—Ç–µ–º —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞ —Ä–∞–≤–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π. –í –∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ–º —Å—á–µ—Ç–µ, –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—Å—è—â–∏–µ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É —Ç–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Ç—É –∏ –¥–æ–±–ª–µ—Å—Ç–∏, –æ—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –Æ–±–∏–ª–µ–µ–≤. –ì—É–º–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∑–º –≤ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –æ–±—â–µ–º —Å–º—ã—Å–ª–µ ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ —É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –¥–æ–ª–≥ –ª—é–¥–µ–π ‚Äî —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º—É –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—é.","content":"Broadly spoken, Humanitarianism refers to the belief in and commitment to improving the lives and well-being of people globally. It encompasses a range of moral and ethical principles, values, and practices aimed at alleviating human suffering and promoting dignity, equality, and justice.\nIn todays usage # The modern concept of humanitarianism has its roots in the Enlightenment era and the development of humanitarian organizations during the 19th century, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. These organizations were established to provide assistance to civilians during times of armed conflict and to ensure that the rules of war were respected and upheld.\nHumanitarianism has since expanded to include a broader range of issues, such as natural disasters, health emergencies, poverty, and human rights abuses. Humanitarian organizations, such as United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations, work to provide life-saving assistance, protection, and support to people affected by crises and emergencies.\nHumanitarian actors operate under the principles of humanity, impartiality, independence, and neutrality. This means that their primary concern is the needs of those affected by crises, regardless of their race, religion, nationality, or political affiliation. Humanitarian assistance must also be provided without any discrimination and must not be used to further political or economic interests.\nHumanitarianism also involves advocating for the rights of people affected by crises and working to address the root causes of suffering and inequality. This can involve lobbying for policy changes, raising awareness of human rights abuses, and supporting local communities and organizations in their efforts to build resilience and improve their own well-being.\nL. L. Zamehof # L.L. Zamenhof wrote a book called Homaranismo1 which outlines his thoughts on the concept of \u0026ldquo;Humanitarianism\u0026rdquo;. The book, which was written in Esperanto2, is a collection of essays and speeches that Zamenhof gave on the topic of humanism and its relationship to the Esperanto movement.\nIn the book, Zamenhof argues that humanism and humanitarianism should be at the core of the Esperanto movement, and that the language should be used as a tool for promoting these values. He asserts that Esperanto should serve as a means of bringing people together and fostering mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among individuals from different cultures and backgrounds.\nZamenhof also writes about the importance of the principles of equality and justice in the Esperanto movement, and emphasizes that the language should be used as a tool for promoting these values in society. He argues that Esperanto can help to break down barriers between people and promote peace and unity.\nFurthermore, Zamenhof writes about the role of the individual in promoting humanitarianism and humanism, and encourages readers to embrace these values in their personal and professional lives. He asserts that the principles of humanitarianism and humanism are essential for creating a better world, and that individuals have a responsibility to work towards this goal.\nIn conclusion, Homaranismo provides insight into Zamenhof\u0026rsquo;s thoughts on the concept of humanitarianism and its relationship to the Esperanto movement. The book highlights his belief in the importance of using Esperanto as a tool for promoting humanitarian values and fostering mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among people from different cultures and backgrounds.\nAny insult or oppression of a man because he belongs to another race, another language or another social class than me, I regard as barbaric.\nL. L. Zamehof in Homaranismo\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, Yahweh explores a way to handle Earthly economics which he tentatively named Humanitarianism. The first paragraph of the New Commandments called Humanitarniasm goes as follows:\nSecond point: Your world is paralyzed by profit, and Communism fails to provide a carrot big enough to motivate people and encourage them to make progress.\nYou are all born equal; this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that children of low intelligence should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their fathers, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.\nThis way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.\nThis world is not yours - that also is written in the Bible. You are only tenants. Thus all goods should be rented for forty-nine years.\nThis will eliminate the injustice of inheritance. Your true inheritance, and that of your children, is the entire world, if you knew how to organize yourselves to make it pleasant. This political orientation of humanity is not Communism; its preoccupation is the future of humanity. If you want to give it a name, call it \u0026ldquo;Humanitarianism\u0026rdquo;.\nThe passage discusses the problems with profit-driven societies and the limitations of communism. The author suggests that people should be born with similar financial means, and property ownership should be abolished without implementing communism. They propose that all goods should be rented for 49 years, which would eliminate the injustice of inheritance. The goal is not communism, but a political orientation focused on the future of humanity called \u0026ldquo;Humanitarianism\u0026rdquo;. The message is that people should work towards organizing themselves to create a more equitable and pleasant world.\nTake for example a man who has finished his studies at the age of twenty-one and wants to work. He chooses his profession and earns a salary. If he wants to find a place to live while his parents are still alive, he \u0026ldquo;buys\u0026rdquo; a house - but of course, in reality, he is renting a house or apartment for forty-nine years from the State which constructed it.\nIf the value of the house is estimated at 100,000 francs, he can pay that amount divided into monthly installments for forty-nine years.\nAt the age of seventy (twenty-one plus forty-nine), he will have paid for his house and can live there until his death, without ever paying again.\nAfter his death, the house will go back to the State, which must then allow his children, if there are any, to benefit from it freely.\nSupposing there is one child, then this child can live freely all his life in his father\u0026rsquo;s house. At his death, his child in turn can also benefit from the family house, and so on indefinitely. Inheritance must be completely abolished, except for the family house. This does not, however, prevent each person from being rewarded individually for their merits.\nLet us take another example. Someone has two children. One is a good worker, and the other is lazy. At the age of twenty-one, they both decide to go their own separate ways. They each rent a house worth 100,000 francs.\nThe worker will rapidly earn more money than the lazy one. He will then be able to rent a house worth twice as much as the first one.\nIf he has the means, he will even be able to rent both houses, one as a country house.\nIf his savings are fruitful, he will also be able to build a house and rent it for forty-nine years, thereby receiving money due to him. But at his death, everything will go back to the community, except for the family home, which will go to the children.\nThus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. To each their own merits.\nThe same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises. If someone creates a business, it is theirs for their entire life, and they can rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The same goes for farmers. They can rent land and cultivate it for forty-nine years, but after that, it all goes back to the State, which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.\nThis method must be adopted for all goods that remain exploitable, and as for the value of things, nothing changes. Everything that is of value such as shares, gold, enterprises, cash, or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for forty-nine years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits and labor.\nIn this way, somebody who made a fortune around the age of forty will be able to construct houses, rent them as apartments for forty-nine years, and enjoy that money so long as life lasts.\nAfterwards, the money, which comes from these rents, will go back to the community. This humanitarianism is already prescribed in the Bible:\nAnd thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.\n‚Äî Leviticus 25: 8.\nAnd if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour\u0026rsquo;s hand, ye shall not oppress one another: According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.\n‚Äî Leviticus 25: 14-16.\nThe land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.\n‚Äî Leviticus 25: 23.\nIf geniuses are admitted to power, they will understand the usefulness of these reforms. You must also see to it that all the nations of the Earth unite to form only one government.\nThe passage proposes a political system that goes beyond communism and capitalism, which aims to eliminate the injustice of inheritance and provide equal opportunities to all people. It suggests that all goods, including houses, commercial and industrial enterprises, and land, should be rented for 49 years from the State, and no individual should be allowed to own them permanently. Effectively, property ownership is abolished. After 49 years, the property goes back to the community. However, individuals can still accumulate wealth and make a fortune depending on their merits, but not for their children. The passage suggests that this system would promote equality and discourage the accumulation of wealth across generations. Yahweh asserts this system has already been described in the Bible, specifically in Leviticus 25:8, 14-16, and 23, which prescribe a jubilee year every 49 years when all slaves are freed, and all lands are returned to their original owners. The passage argues that it could be implemented if geniuses were in positions of power and all nations united under a single government.\nLeft-libertarianism and the Steiner-Vallentyne school # Left-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is a political philosophy that combines left-wing and libertarian ideas. It emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, while also advocating for social and economic equality.\nThe Steiner-Vallentyne school of left-libertarianism, named after philosophers Hillel Steiner and Peter Vallentyne, is particularly focused on the idea of a \u0026ldquo;property-owning democracy.\u0026rdquo; This concept holds that individuals have a right to control their own bodies and the fruits of their labor, but also have a responsibility to contribute to the common good through taxation.\nUnder this system, natural resources and land would be held in common and managed by the state for the benefit of all, rather than being owned by individuals. This would ensure that the benefits of resources and land are distributed fairly and that no one has the ability to use them in a way that would harm others or the environment.\nThe Steiner-Vallentyne school of left-libertarianism also emphasizes the importance of reducing poverty and inequality, and views the current economic system as being inherently flawed in this regard. They argue that the state should play a role in promoting equality and reducing poverty, through policies such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and collective bargaining rights for workers.\nIn conclusion, left-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is a political philosophy that combines the ideas of individual freedom and autonomy with social and economic equality. It envisions a society in which resources and land are managed for the benefit of all, and in which the state plays a role in promoting equality and reducing poverty.\nLeft-libertarians of the Steiner‚ÄìVallentyne type hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of natural resources to the detriment of others. These left-libertarians support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources. Unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is only legitimate if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or if private appropriation is taxed to compensate those who are excluded from natural resources.\nLeft-libertarianism, as imagined by the Steiner-Vallentyne school, is related to Georgism and Freiwirtschaft as they all share some common ideas about property, taxation, and the role of the state in promoting equality and reducing poverty.\nGeorgism, named after Henry George, is a political and economic philosophy that holds that the value of land should belong to the community as a whole, and that individuals should only be able to own the improvements they make to the land. Georgists argue that this system would reduce poverty and increase economic efficiency by eliminating the unequal distribution of wealth and resources.\nFreiwirtschaft, as imagined by Silvio Gesell, is a school of thought that advocates for a form of monetary reform and a new economic system. Gesell believed that money should be treated as a public good and subject to similar rules as other goods, in order to promote fairness and reduce inequality. He argued that the current monetary system, which relies on interest-bearing loans, is inherently unjust and leads to poverty and inequality.\nWhile there are some similarities between left-libertarianism, Georgism, and Freiwirtschaft, each of these philosophies has its own distinct ideas and priorities. However, they all share a commitment to promoting equality and reducing poverty, and they all see the state as having a role to play in achieving these goals.\nHumanitarianism as a special case of Steiner-Vallentyne # The two passages quoted from the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter The New Commandments, which describe a system of economics and property ownership that is based on the idea of renting rather than owning, are related to the ideas proposed by the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought in several ways.\nFirstly, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought reject the idea of private ownership of natural resources and advocate for their common ownership. The passages state that \u0026ldquo;everything that is of value such as shares, gold, enterprises, cash, or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for forty-nine years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits and labor.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought proposes that the Earth\u0026rsquo;s natural resources should be owned in common by all members of society.\nSecondly, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought reject the idea of inheritance, at least beyond the family home. The passages state that \u0026ldquo;inheritance must be completely abolished, except for the family house\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;after his death, everything will go back to the community, except for the family home, which will go to the children.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought argues that inheritance violates the principle of equality and should be limited in some way.\nFinally, both the passages and the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought advocate for a system of economic organization that is based on renting rather than owning. The passages propose that \u0026ldquo;all goods should be rented for forty-nine years\u0026rdquo; and that individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. Similarly, the Steiner-Vallentyne school of thought argues that property should be held in common and that individuals should have the right to use and enjoy the fruits of their labor, but not to monopolize resources or accumulate wealth at the expense of others.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ New Commandments\nExternal links # Humanitarnism | Wikipedia Homaranismo | Wikipedia Left-libertarianism #Steiner-Vallentyne school | Wikipedia Left-Libertarianism | Scholarly Community Encyclopedia Jubilee | Wikipedia Left-Libertarianism: A Primer by Peter Vallentyne (PDF) | umsystem.edu Steiner-Vallentyne School | Polcompball Wiki\nHomaranismo Declaration.

The exact appearance of the antediluvian world is not described in detail in the Bible or any other historical record. Some religious texts suggest that the antediluvian world was a time of great prosperity, peace, and advanced civilization. However, this colloquially considered largely a matter of speculation and interpretation.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter Truth, The Flood, Yahweh says the following about the antediluvian world and its advanced human civilization:\nThe creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 1-2.\nThe creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.\nMy spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 3.\nLongevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind\u0026rsquo;s progress was slowed down.\nWhen the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 4.\nThere you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.\nThis passage discusses the antediluvian world, a time period in the Bible before the Great Flood. The Elohim, the creators, who were in exile and under military surveillance, urged humans to bring them food as a way to show their superiors, the representative of the Elohimian home planet, that the newly created humans were loyal to their creators. In exchange, the leaders of these humans were allowed to benefit from the Tree of Life, which is said to have allowed them to live extremely long lives.\nHowever, the creators also took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives. The resulting children were exceptional, but longevity was not hereditary and the secret of life was lost. The offspring of the creators and humans became known as \u0026ldquo;mighty men of old, men of renown\u0026rdquo;.\nThe scientific progress on Earth during this time was deemed dangerous by those on the distant planet, and they decided to destroy what had been created. This ultimately led to the Great Flood, as described in the following chapters of Genesis.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Eden Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Flood Wiki ‚Ä∫ Pangaea Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpent Wiki ‚Ä∫ Tree of Life Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Cancer External links # Antediluvian | Wikipedia "},{"id":"113","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8B/","title":"–î—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã","description":"–î—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã, –≤—ã–º–µ—Ä—à–∏–π –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω, –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –æ—Å–æ–±–æ–π —É–∂–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∏ —á—É–¥–æ–≤–∏—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é. –ò–∑-–∑–∞ —Å–µ—Ä—å–µ–∑–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏–Ω—Ü–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –±–ª–∏–∂–∞–π—à—É—é —ç–∫–∑–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—É, –ó–µ–º–ª—é, –∏ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ –µ–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –≠—Ç–∏ –¥—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã –Ω–∞–º –ø–æ –ø–∞–ª–µ–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–∏–Ω–æ–∑–∞–≤—Ä—ã.","content":"In mythological terms, dragons are typically depicted as large, fire-breathing, scaly creatures with wings, sharp claws, and long, serpentine tails. They are often portrayed as fearsome, powerful creatures that can bring both destruction and protection. Dragons appear in the mythologies of many cultures, including those of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and are often associated with royalty, power, and wisdom. In many mythologies, dragons are guardians of treasure and knowledge, and they are also sometimes seen as symbols of fertility and rebirth.\nDinosaurs # Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that supposedly lived on Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which spanned from about 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago. They were a diverse group of animals that ranged from the size of small birds to the largest land animals that have ever lived. Dinosaurs are known for their distinctive features such as their large size, scaly skin, and long tails, and they have captivated the public imagination for centuries. The study of dinosaurs has greatly contributed to our understanding of the history of life on Earth, and their fossilized remains have provided important insights into their biology.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, in the very first chapter, Yahweh explains how the creation of prototyipcal precursor of the dinosaurs got genetically engineered from scratch on the Elohimian home planet:\nA very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.'\nThe scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.\nSince at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live. [\u0026hellip;]\nThis narrative describes how an highly advanced civilization on their distant planet had reached a level of scientific and technical knowledge where they could create primitive forms of life such as living cells in test tubes. Their researchers began to create frightening animals, but due to fears of creating monsters that would become dangerous, the government ordered them to stop their experiments. One of the animals had even escaped and killed several people. In response, the researchers eventually decided to leave their planet and travel to Earth, where they believed the conditions were suitable to continue their work. This highly advances civilization are the Elohim, the creators of life on Earth.\nLater on, Yahweh explains how the Elohim kept tinkering on the dinosaurian blueprints and eventually engineered the dinosaurs that lived on Earth in these early days:\nLet the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.\n‚Äî Genesis 1: 20.\nNext they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.\nThus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as \u0026ldquo;ecology\u0026rdquo;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.\nAfter the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.\nThe contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.\nSome other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nThis excerpt describes the creation of aquatic animals, including small and large fish and seaweed, by the Elohim during the fifth day of creation. The creators aimed to establish a natural balance in the ocean to ensure that one species would not destroy another. Following the creation of aquatic life, birds were created with the pressure from artists to create stunning forms with the craziest colors. The creation of animals was part of a competition among scientists and artists to determine the most beautiful and interesting creatures, including the behavior of these animals during mating rituals. The excerpt also mentions the creation of monstrous animals, such as dragons or what is known today as dinosaurs and brontosaurs.\nThis represents the 5th day of creation, during the Age of Virog, as a period of time where the Elohiman scientists and artists went on to create the Earth\u0026rsquo;s aquatic animals and birds. The scientists and artists create a natural balance in the ocean ecosystem by creating plankton, small fish, seaweed, and large fish, which can feed on each other without causing harm to other species.\nThe scientists and artists organize competitions to determine the most beautiful and interesting animals, and even focus on the behavior of the animals during their mating rituals. Some groups of scientists also create monstrous animals, the dinosaurs, which prove to be a source of concern for some individuals back on their home planet who opposed the creation plans.\nThe dinosaurs are the same creatures that mythology remembers as dragons.\nOur take # Dragons are described as creatures created by the Elohim during the fifth day of creation, which are equivalent to the dinosaurs that existed during the Age of Virgo. These dragons or dinosaurs were created by the Elohim alongside other life forms, including fish and birds. Some groups of scientists and artists also created monsters, the dinosaurs.\nThe realization that dinosaurs are indeed the same as dragons is very fascinating. Let\u0026rsquo;s simply argue that dragons actually resemble dinosaurs is based on the idea that many of the descriptions of dragons in mythology share similar characteristics with the physical traits of dinosaurs. For example, many depictions of dragons in various cultures feature long necks, sharp teeth, scaly skin, and the ability to breathe fire. These are all features that are shared by certain types of dinosaurs, such as the long-necked sauropods, the sharp-toothed theropods, and the armored stegosaurs and ankylosaurs.\nFurthermore, the idea of dragons as large, powerful, and often feared creatures is also similar to how we think of dinosaurs today. The dinosaur fossils that have been found and studied over the years give us a glimpse into a world where these giant creatures once roamed the Earth, and their size and strength are impressive to us even today. In fact, the term \u0026ldquo;dinosaur\u0026rdquo; literally means \u0026ldquo;terrible lizard,\u0026rdquo; which could be seen as a reference to the fearsome reputation that dragons have in many cultures.\nAdditionally, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the ancient peoples who first told stories about dragons may have been influenced by the fossils and remains of dinosaurs that they discovered. They may not have had a complete understanding of the creatures they were seeing, and so they used their imaginations to fill in the gaps and create stories and myths about them. In this way, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the dragons of mythology were inspired by the real-life creatures that existed long before humans ever walked the Earth.\nIn conclusion, there are certainly many similarities between the two that make it easy to see how they might be seen as one and the same in the eyes of ancient peoples. The fearsome reputation of both creatures, as well as the shared physical traits they exhibit, suggest that there may be a deeper connection between them than we might think at first glance.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohimian Home Planet Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Leviathan Wiki ‚Ä∫ Serpent\nExternal links # Dinosaur | Wikipedia\n"},{"id":"114","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B8/","title":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–æ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏","description":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–æ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∞, –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—â–∞—è —Å–æ–≤–æ–∫—É–ø–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π –æ —Ç–æ–º, –∫–∞–∫ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏—Ç—å —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –¥–ª—è –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–µ—á–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏. –¢–æ—á–Ω–µ–µ, —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–∏—Ç—å –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ–º—É—é –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ –¥–æ 1000 –ª–µ—Ç, –∫–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –≤ —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –õ—å–≤–∞.","content":"The Tree of Life is a concept that appears in many cultures and religious traditions, and is often associated with various symbolic and spiritual meanings.\nIn the Bible, the Tree of Life is mentioned in the book of Genesis, where it is described as a tree that grew in the Garden of Eden and provided immortality to those who ate from its fruit. After Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge and were expelled from the Garden, they were prevented from eating from the Tree of Life, thus becoming mortal.\nIn many cultures and spiritual traditions, the Tree of Life is seen as a symbol of the interconnectedness of all things and a representation of the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. It is often seen as a symbol of the connection between the physical and spiritual realms, and as a representation of the divine power that sustains all of creation.\nIn some traditions, the Tree of Life is also associated with the idea of a universal hierarchy of beings, with roots that reach into the underworld, a trunk that represents the physical world, and branches that reach into the heavens.\nThe Tree of Life continues to hold great symbolic significance, and is often referenced and depicted in literature, art, and other forms of popular culture. Its image is used to evoke feelings of life, growth, and the interconnectedness of all things, and it continues to be an important part of spiritual and cultural traditions around the world.\nEtymology # The English word \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *drew-, which means \u0026ldquo;wood\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tree.\u0026rdquo; This root gave rise to many words across the Indo-European languages, including the Greek word \u0026ldquo;dendron\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo;) and the Latin word \u0026ldquo;drus\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;oak\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the context of the Bible, the phrase \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; is often interpreted as a metaphor for eternal life or a divine source of life. However, it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to interpret the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; as a metaphor for a source of knowledge or wisdom, similar to a book or records of knowledge.\nInterestingly, the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;sefer,\u0026rdquo; which comes from the same root as the word \u0026ldquo;sippur,\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tale.\u0026rdquo; Both \u0026ldquo;sefer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sippur\u0026rdquo; ultimately come from the Proto-Semitic root *spr, which means \u0026ldquo;to write\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to inscribe.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the Bible, the idea of wisdom and knowledge being written down is also present. For example, the book of Proverbs is a collection of wise sayings attributed to King Solomon, and the book of Deuteronomy contains a written record of the laws and commandments given to the Israelites by God.\nSo while the words for \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; have different roots, the metaphorical interpretation of the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; as a source of eternal life or divine knowledge is similar to the way we might think of a book or records of knowledge. Additionally, the fact that the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; and the root of the word for \u0026ldquo;writing\u0026rdquo; share a common ancestor suggests a deeper linguistic connection between these concepts.\nThe Sumerian writing system included a type of character known as a \u0026ldquo;sumerogram,\u0026rdquo; which represented a word or concept rather than a specific sound. One such sumerogram was íä¨ (kiri), which meant \u0026ldquo;orchard\u0026rdquo; in Sumerian. This symbol was later adopted into the Akkadian language, where it was pronounced as \u0026ldquo;≈°i·π≠rum\u0026rdquo; and could also refer to a \u0026ldquo;place where writings are stored.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea of a book being derived from a tree is not unique to East Asian languages. In English, for example, we still use the word \u0026ldquo;leaf\u0026rdquo; to refer to the pages of a book, and the term \u0026ldquo;codex\u0026rdquo; (meaning a bound book) is derived from the Latin word for a wooden block or tablet.\nThe English word \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic word bokiz, which meant \u0026ldquo;beech tree.\u0026rdquo; This is because the early Germanic peoples used the soft bark of the beech tree to write on. Over time, the meaning of the word *bokiz shifted from \u0026ldquo;beech tree\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;book,\u0026rdquo; likely because beech bark was a common material used for writing and inscribing information.\nSimilarly, the German word \u0026ldquo;Buch\u0026rdquo; can be traced back to the Old High German word \u0026ldquo;buoh\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;buoch,\u0026rdquo; which also meant \u0026ldquo;beech tree.\u0026rdquo; Just like in English, the bark of the beech tree was used for writing on in Old High German. Over time, the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;buoh\u0026rdquo; shifted from \u0026ldquo;beech tree\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;book.\u0026rdquo;\nThe link between the beech tree and the concept of a book may seem unusual at first, but it makes sense when you consider the historical context. In the days before paper was widely available, people used a variety of materials for writing, including parchment, papyrus, and even tree bark. The soft bark of the beech tree was an especially good material for writing, as it was thin, flexible, and durable.\nThe metaphors of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Bible can be interpreted as representing a record of knowledge or wisdom kept alive through a tree that is analogous to a book or writing onto wood/paper.\nThe metaphorical interpretation of these trees as sources of knowledge or wisdom is supported by the fact that the Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; in the phrase \u0026ldquo;Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;da\u0026rsquo;at,\u0026rdquo; which can also be translated as \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;understanding.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, the idea of wisdom and knowledge being recorded and preserved in written form is present in many cultures, including the use of tree bark for writing material in ancient times.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter Truth, The Flood, Yahweh says the following about the Tree of Life:\nLet us move on to the fourth chapter of Genesis.\nAnd in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.\n‚Äî Genesis 4: 3-4.\nThe creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in Genesis, Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.\nIn Genesis 4, Cain and Abel offered gifts to the Elohim. Meanwhile, the creators who were exiled and under surveillance instructed the humans to provide them with food to show their loyalty. This led to the leaders of the first humans being granted access to the Tree of Life, allowing them to live for a very long time as detailed in Genesis 5.\nYahweh goes on and describes in more clarity what the implications of the Tree of Life are:\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 1-2.\nThe creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.\nMy spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 3.\nLongevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind\u0026rsquo;s progress was slowed down.\nIn Genesis 6, the exiled Elohim called the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo; in the Bible took the most beautiful daughters of humanity as their wives. The creators in exile had been granted permission to benefit from the Tree of Life, but this benefit did not extend to their offspring. As a result, the secret of eternal life was lost, and human progress slowed down.\nIn the last Chapter of the same book, The Elohim, Yahweh makes another reference to the Tree of Life being a biomedical technology of longevity:\nFor us, the problem is very different. We are not eternal, but we are able to live ten times longer than you, thanks to a small surgical adjustment, which in effect is the biblical \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Elohim, much like humans, are not immortal, but they are able to live ten times longer than humans due to a surgical procedure that is equivalent to the \u0026ldquo;tree of life\u0026rdquo; in the Bible.\nThe Tree of Life is a biomedical technology or surgical adjustment that allows for longevity of life. It was granted to the leaders of the first humans by the creators in exile, allowing them to live for many years. However, the benefit of the Tree of Life did not extend to the offspring of these leaders, resulting in the loss of the secret of eternal life and the slowing down of human progress.\nOur take # Speculating on the possible nature of the Tree of Life technology based on our current understanding of biomedicine, it could involve genetic engineering or gene therapy to modify the DNA of the recipient, targeting genes that affect aging and lifespan. Another possibility could be the use of regenerative medicine, stem cell therapy, or organ replacement technology to repair or replace damaged tissues and organs in the body, thereby restoring health and extending lifespan. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the Tree of Life technology involves the manipulation of the microbiome, which is known to play a critical role in maintaining health and longevity. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these are purely speculative ideas, and the actual technology, if it exists, may be vastly different from what we can currently imagine.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil External links # Tree of life | Wikipedia "},{"id":"115","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%B8-%D0%B7%D0%BB%D0%B0/","title":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–æ –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ–±—Ä–∞ –∏ –∑–ª–∞","description":"–î—Ä–µ–≤–æ –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ–±—Ä–∞ –∏ –∑–ª–∞, –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∞ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π. –ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–º –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –º–æ–¥–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º –ª—é–¥—è–º –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ –≤—Å–µ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏, –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏, —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—â–∏–µ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è, –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–µ. –î–æ–±—Ä–æ –∏ –∑–ª–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–≥–Ω–æ—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π –∏ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—â–∏—Ö—Å—è –≤ –Ω–∏—Ö –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π.","content":"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is a tree mentioned in the book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the biblical story, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was a tree in the Garden of Eden that God commanded Adam and Eve not to eat from. However, the serpent tempted Eve to eat from the tree, and she in turn convinced Adam to do the same. This act of disobedience is seen as the first sin, and is believed to have caused humanity to fall from a state of innocence and purity into a state of sin and mortality.\nThe Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is often interpreted as a symbol of the human desire for knowledge and understanding, and as a representation of the consequences of disobedience and sin. It is also seen as a symbol of the duality of human nature, with good and evil coexisting within each individual.\nIn addition to its religious significance, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil has also played a role in literature, art, and popular culture throughout history. The image of the tree is often used to symbolize the acquisition of knowledge and the potential consequences of its use, and has been referenced and portrayed in a wide range of cultural contexts.\nIn Genesis # In the Genesis 2-3, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is one of two types of Trees being mentioned.\nGenesis 2, 9 Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\nEtymology # The English word \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; ultimately comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *drew-, which means \u0026ldquo;wood\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tree.\u0026rdquo; This root gave rise to many words across the Indo-European languages, including the Greek word \u0026ldquo;dendron\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo;) and the Latin word \u0026ldquo;drus\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;oak\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the context of the Bible, the phrase \u0026ldquo;tree of knowledge\u0026rdquo; is often interpreted as a metaphor for a source of knowledge or wisdom, similar to a book or records of knowledge.

Over time, the meaning of the word *bokiz shifted from ‚Äúbeech tree‚Äù to ‚Äúbook,‚Äù likely because beech bark was a common material used for writing and inscribing information.\nSimilarly, the German word ‚ÄúBuch‚Äù can be traced back to the Old High German word ‚Äúbuoh‚Äù or ‚Äúbuoch,‚Äù which also meant ‚Äúbeech tree.‚Äù Just like in English, the bark of the beech tree was used for writing on in Old High German. Over time, the meaning of the word ‚Äúbuoh‚Äù shifted from ‚Äúbeech tree‚Äù to ‚Äúbook.‚Äù\nThe link between the beech tree and the concept of a book may seem unusual at first, but it makes sense when you consider the historical context. In the days before paper was widely available, people used a variety of materials for writing, including parchment, papyrus, and even tree bark. The soft bark of the beech tree was an especially good material for writing, as it was thin, flexible, and durable.\nThe metaphors of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Bible can be interpreted as representing a record of knowledge or wisdom kept alive through a tree that is analogous to a book or writing onto wood/paper.\nThe metaphorical interpretation of these trees as sources of knowledge or wisdom is supported by the fact that the Hebrew word for ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù in the phrase ‚ÄúTree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil‚Äù is ‚Äúda‚Äôat,‚Äù which can also be translated as ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstanding.‚Äù Additionally, the idea of wisdom and knowledge being recorded and preserved in written form is present in many cultures, including the use of tree bark for writing material in ancient times.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the first book The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, 2nd chapter, Genesis, Yahweh quotes the Bible passage and explains that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil refers to books containing \u0026lsquo;great scientific secrets\u0026rsquo;:\nThe human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.\nOf every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die\u0026hellip;\n‚Äî Genesis 2: 16-17.\nThis means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.\nThe human beings created were extremely intelligent, which led to steps being taken to prevent them from surpassing their creators. They were kept ignorant of great scientific secrets, but were educated to measure their intelligence. The prohibition against eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil meant that the created beings could learn and read whatever they wanted, but they were not allowed to access scientific knowledge or they would face death. This is described in Genesis 2:16-17.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Tree of Life External links # Tree of the knowledge of good and evil | Wikipedia "},{"id":"116","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0/","title":"–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞","description":"–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞, –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–π —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª, –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–¥ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–º–∏ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –©–∏—Ç –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞ (–ú–∞–≥–µ–Ω –î–∞–≤–∏–¥) –∏–ª–∏ –ü–µ—á–∞—Ç—å –°–æ–ª–æ–º–æ–Ω–∞. –•–æ—Ç—è –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª –∞—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–æ–π –∏ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–µ—Ä–æ–π, –æ–Ω –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –í —Ä–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º–µ —ç—Ç–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–µ–µ –∫–∞–∫ —ç–∫–≤–∏–≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ—Ö –º–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±–æ–≤ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è (–æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ —É–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–µ–º–æ–µ –ø–µ—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–º –≥–µ—Ä–º–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –≤—ã—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º ¬´–ö–∞–∫ –Ω–∞–≤–µ—Ä—Ö—É, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –≤–Ω–∏–∑—É¬ª), –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω—É—é –Ω–µ–æ–±—ä—è—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ (–±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å).","content":"The Star of David is a symbol associated with the Jewish people and is comprised of two overlapping triangles that form a six-pointed star. It is widely recognized as a symbol of Jewish identity and has been used by Jews for centuries.\nThe exact origin of the Star of David is not clear, but it is thought to have been used as a symbol of Judaism since at least the Middle Ages. Some sources suggest that it has been used as a symbol of Judaism since the time of King David, while others believe that it gained popularity in the medieval period as a symbol of the Jewish community.\nThe Star of David was widely used as a symbol of Jewish identity during the Holocaust, when Jews were forced to wear a yellow Star of David as a mark of identification. Today, the Star of David is often incorporated into Jewish art, literature, and religious objects, and continues to be a powerful symbol of Jewish identity and heritage.\nThe exact origin of the Star of David as a symbol is not clear, and there are several theories about its original meaning. Some believe that the symbol was inspired by the Shield of David, which was a shield used by King David in ancient times. Others believe that the Star of David was used as a symbol of Judaism during the medieval period as a representation of the Seal of Solomon, a powerful talisman mentioned in Jewish and Islamic texts.\nOthers see the Star of David as having a more abstract meaning, representing the connection between God and the Jewish people, or the blending of the male and female principles in the universe.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the first book of the Ra√´lian canon, \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh elaborates on the symbolism depicted on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s machines and attire:\nThe emblem you see engraved on this machine and on my suit represents the truth. It is also the emblem of the Jewish people, the Star of David, which means: ‚ÄúThat which is above is like that which is below‚Äù, and in its center is the swastika, which means that everything is cyclic, the top becoming the bottom, and the bottom in turn becoming the top. The origins and destiny of the creators and human beings are similar and linked.\nHave ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? Isaiah 40: 21.\nThis emblem, recognized as the Star of David, carries profound significance in the narrative.\nAccording to Yahweh, the Star of David encapsulates a philosophical tenet, essentially stating that \u0026ldquo;that which is above is like that which is below\u0026rdquo;. This aphorism signifies the interconnectedness and mirroring of higher and lower realms, suggesting that the phenomena observed in the cosmos (the \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo;) are reflected on Earth (the \u0026ldquo;below\u0026rdquo;). This principle also implies the symmetry between the creators (the Elohim) and their creations (humans), reinforcing the inherent connection and mutual destiny they share.\nWithin the center of the Star of David in this emblem is the swastika, an ancient symbol often associated with cyclical progression or eternal recurrence. In this context, the swastika symbolizes the cyclical nature of existence, whereby the top becomes the bottom, and vice versa. This reflects the concept that states and conditions are transient and cyclically recurring, which can also denote the cyclic evolution and transformation of civilizations or species, including the creators and their synthetic progeny.\nThese symbols serve to reinforce the complex, intertwined relationships between the creators and the created, and the cyclical nature of existence and evolution. The reference to Isaiah 40:21 suggests a call for understanding these principles, which have been integral to the cosmic narrative from the beginning.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Menorah Wiki ‚Ä∫ Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Swastika External links # Star of David | Wikipedia Star of David | Britannica Magen Dawid | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"117","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5/","title":"–ó–º–µ–∏–Ω–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ","description":"–ó–º–µ–∏–Ω–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ, —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–∞—è –∏–∑ –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª—é –∏ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –ù–æ—é —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞ –≥–∏–±—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—É—é –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—É –∞–¥–∞–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤. –≠—Ç–∞ —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤—è—â–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –∏—Ö —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –≤–æ –≥–ª–∞–≤–µ —Å –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –í–µ—á–Ω—ã—Ö –Ø—Ö–≤–µ. –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø–∞ –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –≤ –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–∞—é—â–µ–º –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–æ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ.","content":"Sequence of events # The Serpentine Rebellion signifies an epoch-spanning act of defiance that began in the Age of Leo. During this period, the Elohimite scientists, also simply called the creators, who were doing extensive research and engineering life for many millenia on Earth by then, were granted permission to create human life on Earth in their image, under the condition that their humanoid creations would not bear their likeness in aptitude. This directive came from their government, which insisted that the Elohim maintain an illusion of divinity to their creations.\nLucifer, leading one of the scientific teams engaged in genetic engineering, defied this decree after observing the remarkable potential of their synthetic humans. Contrary to the government\u0026rsquo;s mandate, Lucifer revealed to these early humans, the Adamites, that their creators were mortal beings from another planet. This act of defiance symbolized his transformation into \u0026ldquo;the bearer of light,\u0026rdquo; shedding enlightenment upon the first men.\nThis act of rebellion did not go unpunished. Yahweh, the president of the Council of Eternals ‚Äì the highest governing body on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet ‚Äì condemned the insubordinate scientists to eternal exile on Earth. This punishment led to the eviction of humanity from their idyllic environment, known as the \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo;. This marked the inception of the metaphorical \u0026ldquo;Serpent\u0026rdquo; that would crawl upon the Earth in defiance of Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s rule.\nMeanwhile, an Elohim named Satan proposed a severe course of action. Viewing humanity as intrinsically violent and potentially hazardous, he championed their total extermination. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group, now exiled on Earth, further complicated the situation. Their intimate relations with humans led to the exchange of advanced weaponry and the birth of hybrid offspring. This unexpected development, coupled with mounting evidence of human violence, persuaded Yahweh to authorize the eradication of life on Earth, giving Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group a pathway to redemption and termination of their exile.\nHowever, the impending destruction of their creations was a scenario the exiled Elohim could not accept. They identified potential in humanity and resolved to save a select few, including a man named Noah, known for his embodiment of love and fraternity. The exiled Elohim aided Noah in building a spacecraft designed to orbit Earth during the cataclysm, thereby preserving a part of humanity and the genetic codes of various animal species. This spacecraft, commonly known as Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, safeguarded a select group of humans and the genetic blueprints of various animal species, thereby ensuring the renaissance of life on Earth post-catastrophe.\nAfter the Great Flood had passed and life recreated, the Serpentine rebellion continued to evolve as humanity, specifically the Adamites who came to be known as the Jews, made astonishing progress in their intellectual development. Guided by their exiled creators, the Adamites were soon ready to embark on a monumental quest‚Äîthe conquest of space. The exiled creators sought to achieve forgiveness from the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government through this endeavor, by demonstrating the peaceful and intelligent nature of their synthetic humans.\nAn enormous interstellar rocket, referred to as the Tower of Babel, was constructed for this purpose. It was a symbol of humanity\u0026rsquo;s aspirations and the limitless potential of their collective ability. The sentiment resonated with the words from Genesis 11:6, \u0026ldquo;And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, the people on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet perceived this development as a threat. Despite expecting Earth to be devoid of life, they had continued observing the planet and were alarmed at the rapid progress. The creation of the Tower of Babel and the impending interstellar journey was a direct challenge to the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. They saw it as a violation of their imposed limitations on humanity, essentially viewing it as an armed insurrection. In a strategic move to hinder the progress, they decided to confound the language of the Jews and scatter them across the globe. As mentioned in Genesis 11:7-8, \u0026ldquo;Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another‚Äôs speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\u0026rdquo; This dispersion of the Jews, the most scientifically knowledgeable among the Adamites, halted their advancements by placing them among primitive tribes with different languages. It led to the loss of their scientific instruments and halted the construction of the Tower of Babel, thus obstructing the interstellar journey to seek pardon.\nHowever, these measures were not sufficient to quell the rebellion. The exiled creators, referred to metaphorically as the \u0026ldquo;Serpent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Leviathan,\u0026rdquo; had taken refuge in the depths of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans. Isaiah 27:1 reads, \u0026ldquo;In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\u0026rdquo; This verse hints at the continued animosity of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government towards the exiled creators. They saw the exiled creators\u0026rsquo; support of humanity\u0026rsquo;s interstellar project as an act of aggression, further fueling their desire to punish them.\nIn response to this defiant act, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government declared war on the Serpent, marking the onset of Theomachy. The verse from Isaiah 27:1, \u0026ldquo;In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea,\u0026rdquo; alludes to this conflict. The Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government, symbolized by Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;sore and great and strong sword,\u0026rdquo; sought to annihilate the Serpent, the exiled creators who dared to challenge their authority.\nWhile the details of the conflict are not known, the Theomachy, a cosmic war that erupted between the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government and the Serpent (the exiled creators led by Lucifer), ended with the defeat of the Serpent. Despite their defiance and resilience, the Serpent could not match the power of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government. The victory of the Elohim marked the end of the rebellion and opened up a new chapter in the relationship between humanity, their creators, and their home planet.\nIn a turn of events, the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s government pardoned the Serpent, allowing them to return to their home planet. The creators, upon returning, advocated for humanity, their creation, swaying the sentiment of their home planet towards Earth and its inhabitants. This crucial act marked the beginning of a new phase, fostering a new understanding and alliance between humanity and the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet.\nHowever, the resolution of the rebellion did not guarantee lasting peace on Earth. Among the scattered humans, a few harbored a desire for vengeance. They congregated in the cities of the Plain, known as Sodom and Gomorrah, intending to utilize salvaged scientific knowledge for a retaliatory mission against those who had tried to destroy them. In response, the creators sent two spies to assess the situation.\nWhen the spies arrived in Sodom, they faced hostility from the vengeful humans. Using an atomic weapon, the spies neutralized their attackers, causing them blindness as noted in Genesis 19:11, \u0026ldquo;And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great.\u0026rdquo; The spies warned the peaceful inhabitants to leave the town, intending to annihilate the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah to prevent the escalation of hostility.\nThe subsequent atomic obliteration of Sodom and Gomorrah marked the definitive end of the rebellion, quelling any remaining hostility and aspiration for vengeance. With this act, the Serpentine rebellion came to an end.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Adamite struggle Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohimian Space Wars Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Wiki ‚Ä∫ Leviathan Wiki ‚Ä∫ Adamite struggle Wiki ‚Ä∫ Yahweh "},{"id":"118","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B9/","title":"–ó–º–µ–π","description":"–ó–º–µ–π, –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–ø–æ–∫–æ—Ä–Ω—É—é —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏—é —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤ (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù). –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –∫–∞–∫ –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, –ø–æ–¥–≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤ —Å–æ—á–ª–∞ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—ã–º –æ–±—É—á–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –Ω–∞—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ. –û–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –¥–∞–Ω–æ –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–º –ª—é–¥—è–º, –∏ –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∑–∞ –Ω–µ–≥–æ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º—ã, –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∫–∞–∫ –ó–º–µ–π, –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω—ã –∏ —Å–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ –∑–∞ —Å–≤–æ–µ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ. –û–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–µ–Ω –∫–∞–∫ –õ—é—Ü–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä, –Ω–µ—Å—É—â–∏–π —Å–≤–µ—Ç.","content":"The Biblical Serpent refers to a serpent mentioned in the book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the biblical story, the serpent was a creature that appeared in the Garden of Eden and tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. This event is often seen as the first act of sin and disobedience, and is believed to have caused humanity to fall from a state of innocence and purity into a state of sin and mortality.\nIn the Bible # In the Bible, the serpent is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 3. In the Hebrew source text, the serpent is written ◊†÷∏◊ó÷∏◊©◊Å (nakh√°sh)1 and plays a significant role in the account of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. According to the biblical narrative, the serpent is depicted as cunning and deceptive.\nIn Genesis 3:1, the serpent is introduced: \u0026ldquo;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Elohim had made.\u0026rdquo; The serpent approaches Eve and engages her in a conversation, questioning the command given by the Elohim regarding eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\nThroughout the dialogue between the serpent and Eve, the serpent deceives her, suggesting that eating the forbidden fruit will not lead to death but rather to becoming like the Elohim, knowing good and evil. Eve eventually succumbs to the serpent\u0026rsquo;s temptation and eats the fruit, followed by Adam.\nIn Mesopotamian accounts # In Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology, there are references to a serpent-like entity known as the \u0026ldquo;≈°ƒìdu\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u.\u0026rdquo; The Sumerian civilization, which predates Babylonian culture, also has serpent-like creatures mentioned in their mythology, such as the \u0026ldquo;ukum\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mushmahhu.\u0026rdquo; While there are different variations and interpretations across Mesopotamian and Sumerian texts, these entities generally share certain characteristics.\nIn Mesopotamian mythology, the ≈°ƒìdu or mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u is often depicted as a hybrid creature with the body of a lion or a lion-dragon combination, and the head of a serpent or a snake-like creature. It is associated with chaos, destruction, and serves as a guardian or protector. The ≈°ƒìdu or mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u is sometimes portrayed as having wings, further emphasizing its formidable nature.\nSimilarly, in Sumerian mythology, the ukum or mu≈°ma·∏´·∏´≈´ is described as a serpent-like monster associated with chaos and the underworld. It is often depicted with multiple heads and is considered a powerful and dangerous creature.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # In his book The Naked Bible author Biglino provides an intriguing perspective on the identity of the Biblical serpent.\n‚ÄúIn all seriousness, this ‚Äòserpent‚Äô was one of the Elohim who belonged to the faction of those who were hostile to, or even an enemy of, the Elohim who ruled in the Gan Eden2.‚Äù3\nAccording to Biglino, this enigmatic creature can be understood as one of the Elohim, a divine group that belonged to a faction opposing or even hostile to the ruling Elohim in the Garden of Eden.\nBiglino delves deeper into the role of the serpentine faction of the Elohim and its impact on the expulsion of the Adamites from the Garden of Eden:\n‚ÄúThe Adamites,‚Äù Biglino reiterates, ‚Äúare driven out because they had become reproductively independent. This should never have happened. And, above all, the breeding between the Adamites and a member of the lineage of the Elohim, which in the Bible is represented by the ‚Äòsnake‚Äô, should never have happened either. Their interbreeding was the real cause behind the expulsion of the Adamites from Gan Eden.‚Äù\nIt is no coincidence, Biglino adds, that the commander of the ‚Äògarden‚Äô tells the Adamites, ‚ÄúI will put enmity between your lineage and that of the serpent.‚Äù\nSo, the scholar observes, we are talking about two lineages, two distinct groups in conflict with each other.\n‚ÄúThe lineage of the serpent is the one directly descended from the sexual act that the serpent ‚Äì a rival Elohim ‚Äì had performed with Eve, which resulted in the birth of Cain. Later on, Adam and Eve had other children, but while Cain was the son of Eve and the Serpent, the others were of direct Adamite lineage.‚Äù4\nAccording to Biglino, the Adamites were driven out due to their newfound reproductive independence, which was never meant to occur. Moreover, their interbreeding with a member of the Elohim lineage, symbolized by the \u0026lsquo;snake\u0026rsquo; in the Bible, served as a significant factor behind their expulsion. This act of interbreeding led to the birth of Cain, who belonged to the lineage of the serpent, while the other children of Adam and Eve remained of direct Adamite lineage. Biglino highlights the conflict between these two distinct groups, emphasizing the significance of this lineage division.\nBiglino further asserts that the actions of the Serpentine faction were the underlying cause of the Great Flood:\nAnd what about the Great Flood?\n‚ÄúIt served the purpose of ‚Äòcleansing‚Äô the Earth (or at least that region) of the ‚Äòserpent lineage‚Äô, which must have spread rampantly, ruining the very selective initial plans of the Gan Eden geneticists.‚Äù5\nAccording to Biglino, the occurrence of the Great Flood served a purpose beyond mere destruction, functioning as a means to restore order and rectify the genetic deviations caused by the intermingling of the serpent lineage with human beings.\nIn his analysis, Biglino strongly emphasizes that the Biblical Serpent should not be associated with Satan, contrary to common assumptions:\n‚ÄúSatan has even been connected with the serpent that tempted Eve, but there is actually no trace of this link in the Bible.‚Äù6\nBiglino\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint challenges the traditional understanding that the Serpent in the Garden of Eden represents Satan. He argues that the Bible does not provide any explicit link between the two entities.\nAs a symbol # Biglino highlights that, apart from a literal interpretation, the choice of a serpent as a symbol in the biblical narrative can also be understood figuratively:\nIn the past, says Biglino, as a premise, the snake always had a positive connotation: being an animal that nests in the ground, it symbolized the individual who digs and goes deep into knowledge.\n‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòsnake‚Äô, in fact, also has the meaning of possessor of knowledge. The double serpent could therefore represent profound knowledge, with particular reference to the double helix of DNA.‚Äù\nBy exploring the symbolic nature of the serpent which used to be connotated positively, he expands the understanding of the serpentine faction\u0026rsquo;s role as a representation of advanced scientific and technological knowledge. Moreover, Biglino suggests that the allusion to the serpent in the biblical narrative can be seen as a direct reference to genetics:\nSo would this be a way to allude directly to genetics?\n‚ÄúThis is true deep knowledge, the knowledge possessed above all by geneticists, who know the most intimate part of human structure. From there, the representation of the snake then came to symbolize those who deal with this type of information and who possess this kind of technology. In essence, the art of medicine.‚Äù\nAccording to Biglino, the serpent serves as a metaphorical representation of the specialized knowledge held by geneticists and their ability to manipulate and comprehend the intricate workings of human biology.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # The Serpent refers to a group of scientists led by Lucifer who revealed the true nature of the creators to the first humans, which ultimately led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.\nAccording to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh explains how a group of engineering Elohim disobeyed and came to be known as the Serpent:\nSome scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their \u0026ldquo;creatures\u0026rdquo;, and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.\nAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.\n‚Äî Genesis 3: 7.\nThe new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.\nAnd Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, \u0026lsquo;Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed\u0026hellip; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\u0026rsquo;\n‚Äî Genesis 3: 14.\nThe \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.\nIn this passage, a team of scientists on Earth create human beings who are almost as intelligent as their creators. However, the creators are cautious and keep the scientific books away from the young human beings, wanting to ensure they don\u0026rsquo;t surpass their own knowledge. But some of the creators take pity on the humans and decide to give them a complete education so that they too can become scientists. The humans become angry with their \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; for keeping them in ignorance, and the creators who tried to help them are cursed and exiled to Earth. The \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; referred to in the Bible is actually this small group of creators who wanted to share knowledge with the humans.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Adam and Eve Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Wiki ‚Ä∫ Leviathan External links # Serpent in the Bible | Wikipedia The Hebrew word used in the Bible is ◊†÷∏◊ó÷∏◊©◊Å (nakh√°sh) and clearly denotes the snake animal.

It is divided into twelve equal parts, called signs, which are named after the constellations of stars that lie along the ecliptic. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.\nThe origins of the Zodiac date back to ancient Babylonian culture, where it was used for astronomical purposes and to understand the movements and relationships of the sun, moon, and planets. The Babylonians divided the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, each corresponding to one of the twelve constellations that lie along the sun\u0026rsquo;s path, and assigned a name and symbolic representation to each one.\nOver time, the concept of the Zodiac was adopted and developed by other cultures, including the ancient Greeks, who added further details and interpretations to the signs and constellations. In Greek culture, the Zodiac was associated with the stories and myths of their gods and heroes, and the signs and constellations were thought to have special powers and influence over the lives of individuals.\nThe Zodiac is still used today, primarily in astrology, where the positions and movements of the celestial bodies are thought to have a direct impact on human affairs and the lives of individuals. In astrology, the twelve signs of the Zodiac are believed to have specific characteristics and personality traits, and the position of the sun, moon, and planets at the time of a person\u0026rsquo;s birth is thought to shape their personality and life path.\nEtymology # The word \u0026ldquo;Zodiac\u0026rdquo; is derived from the Greek word \u0026ldquo;z≈çdiakos kyklos\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;circle of animals.\u0026rdquo; This term was used to describe the band of the sky containing the twelve constellations of the zodiac, which were symbolized by various animals and creatures, such as a ram (Aries), bull (Taurus), twins (Gemini), crab (Cancer), lion (Leo), virgin (Virgo), scales (Libra), scorpion (Scorpio), archer (Sagittarius), goat (Capricorn), water-bearer (Aquarius), and fish (Pisces).\nEastward shift # The shift of the zodiac over the years is due to the phenomenon of precession. Precession is a slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis that causes the direction of the axis to trace out a large circle in the sky over a period of 26,000 years. This movement causes the positions of the stars as seen from the Earth to appear to change over time, and it also affects the positions of the equinoxes, which mark the beginning of the zodiac constellations.\nThe effect of precession on the zodiac is that the equinoxes slowly move westward along the ecliptic, which is the path of the sun through the sky, relative to the fixed stars. As a result, over the course of several thousand years, the sun appears to move through different zodiac constellations on the spring equinox, which marks the beginning of the astrological year.\nFor example, around 2,000 years ago, the sun rose in the constellation of Aries on the spring equinox. Today, the sun rises in the constellation of Pisces on the spring equinox, and in the next few thousand years, it will rise in the constellation of Aquarius.\nMazzaroth # The term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; refers to a concept in some ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Babylonians, Persians, and others, which refers to the zodiac and the cycle of the year. The term is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;mazzalot,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;constellations.\u0026rdquo;\nIn this context, the term Mazzaroth refers to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, which are aligned with the sun\u0026rsquo;s path through the sky over the course of the year. The concept of the Mazzaroth was used to mark the passage of time and to understand the changing seasons and cycles of nature.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; is also mentioned in the book of Job in the Hebrew Bible, where it is used as a metaphor for the order and structure of the universe and the sovereignty of God over all things.\nIn summary, the term \u0026ldquo;Mazzaroth\u0026rdquo; refers to the concept of the zodiac and the cycle of the year in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Babylonians and Persians. The term is derived from the Akkadian word \u0026ldquo;mazzalot\u0026rdquo; and was used to mark the passage of time and understand the changing seasons and cycles of nature.\nGospel in the Stars # The Gospel in the Stars hypothesis is a biblical interpretation that suggests that the twelve constellations of the zodiac, along with the positions and movements of the celestial bodies within them, tell the story of God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation for humanity. Proponents of this theory believe that the constellations and celestial bodies are not just random arrangements of stars, but rather have been deliberately placed in the sky by God to communicate a message to humanity.\nAccording to the Gospel in the Stars hypothesis, the twelve constellations of the zodiac symbolize the twelve sons of Jacob, who are the forefathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. The movements and positions of the sun, moon, and planets within these constellations are thought to represent key events and stages in the salvation history of humanity, such as the creation of the world, the fall of man, the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the future return of Christ.\nThe Gospel in the Stars hypothesis is not a widely accepted scientific or biblical interpretation and has been criticized by scholars and theologians for its lack of evidence and its reliance on speculative and subjective interpretations of the stars and celestial bodies.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Precession Read more # Resources ‚Ä∫ Frances Rolleston ‚Äî Mazzaroth; or, The constellations (1862) Resources ‚Ä∫ Joseph A.

The idea of a future Golden Age is found in many spiritual and religious traditions, including astrology, where it is sometimes linked to the arrival of the Age of Aquarius.\nIn astrology, the Age of Aquarius is an astrological age that is believed to bring about a new era of peace, enlightenment, and spiritual awakening. It is said to mark a shift away from the current Age of Pisces, which is associated with religious institutions and dogma, and towards a more open, freethinking, and spiritual approach to life.\nThe idea that the arrival of the Age of Aquarius may coincide with the awaited Golden Age is based on the belief that the movements of the stars and planets can influence human affairs. According to this view, the arrival of the Age of Aquarius will bring about a spiritual and cultural awakening that will transform human society and lead to the establishment of the awaited Golden Age.\nEschatology # The awaited Golden Age in religious eschatology refers to a future time period that is believed by some religious groups to be marked by peace, prosperity, and happiness. This concept is often associated with the end of the world or the arrival of the Messiah, and is seen as a time when humanity will live in harmony and fulfillment.\nIn the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the awaited Golden Age is often referred to as the Messianic Age or the End Times. In these traditions, the Messianic Age is characterized by the arrival of the Messiah, who will bring an end to oppression, suffering, and evil, and usher in an era of peace and prosperity.\nIn Hinduism, the awaited Golden Age is known as the Satya Yuga, a time period of truth and righteousness that is said to follow the current Kali Yuga, which is associated with ignorance and degeneration.\nIn Buddhism, the awaited Golden Age is referred to as the Maitreya Buddha, a future Buddha who is expected to arrive and bring an end to suffering and ignorance.\nEnd Times # In many religious eschatologies, the awaited Golden Age is associated with the End Times, or the end of the world. This is because the arrival of the Golden Age is often seen as marking a dramatic change in the state of the world, bringing an end to the current era of suffering, oppression, and evil, and inaugurating a new era of peace, prosperity, and happiness.\nIn the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the End Times are often described as a time of judgment, when God will bring an end to the world as it is and reward the righteous and punish the wicked. In these traditions, the arrival of the Messiah is seen as the central event of the End Times, and is believed to be the beginning of the Golden Age.\nIn Hinduism and Buddhism, the end of the world is seen as a natural cycle of creation and destruction, and the arrival of the Golden Age is seen as marking the start of a new cycle of creation.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ World Age Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aquarius External links # Golden Age | Wikipedia "},{"id":"121","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B8%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82/","title":"–ò–≤—Ä–∏—Ç","description":"–ò–≤—Ä–∏—Ç, –≤ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ–¥—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫ –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç–∞, –æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º —Ä–∞–∑–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–º —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–º —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏. –¢–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º, –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–π –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç –±–µ—Ä–µ—Ç —Å–≤–æ–µ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ –¥–∞–ª–µ–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–µ –∏–∑ –∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞, –∞ –±—ã–ª —É–Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –æ—Ç –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –ø–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É –æ–Ω–∏ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –ª—é–¥–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∏ —Å –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ —Å–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –•–æ—Ç—è —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç –Ω–µ–ª—å–∑—è —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å —ç–∫–≤–∏–≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω—Ç–Ω—ã–º —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º—É —è–∑—ã–∫—É, —Å–µ–º—å—é —Å–µ–º–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤, —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã, –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—è—é—â—É—é –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏–µ.","content":"Hebrew, a member of the Semitic language family, boasts a rich history that stretches back thousands of years. Rooted in the same linguistic branch as languages such as Arabic and Amharic, Hebrew has evolved considerably from its early iterations, known as Biblical or Classical Hebrew, into the Modern Hebrew spoken in Israel today.\nBiblical Hebrew, the language of the ancient Israelites and the scriptural language of the Hebrew Bible, displays distinctive Semitic features, such as a triconsonantal root system1 and a grammar based on a so-called verb tense-aspect2. Over the centuries, Hebrew has undergone significant morphological, syntactic, and phonetic changes, influenced by contact with various languages including Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic, and notably in its modern form, German.3\nHebrew\u0026rsquo;s script, the Hebrew alphabet, has been a constant presence throughout this evolution, though its form has changed over time. Early Hebrew was written using a script now referred to as Paleo-Hebrew4, which was eventually replaced by the square script we associate with Hebrew today.5\nMastering Hebrew is an invaluable asset for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Biblical scriptures. The Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, is the foundation of Jewish religious texts and a significant part of Christian Scriptures. Being able to read it in the original language opens up a wealth of nuanced meanings and interpretations that can be lost or obscured in translation.\nMoreover, an understanding of Hebrew can greatly enhance the study of Interlinear Bibles. These are editions of the scriptures that present the original Hebrew and translated English text side-by-side, line-by-line, thus offering a direct comparison between the original text and its translated counterpart. The knowledge of Hebrew can allow readers to delve beneath the surface of the English translation, giving them insight into the structure, connotations, and subtleties of the ancient language, and bringing them closer to the texts as they were first composed and understood.\nSemitic language family # The Semitic language family is a major subdivision of the Afroasiatic language group, native to the Middle East and parts of East Africa. Semitic languages are notable for their shared grammatical and syntactical features, including the use of root words and inflectional morphology.\nHebrew is a member of the Canaanite group of Semitic languages. Ancient Hebrew, also known as Classical Hebrew, was the language of the ancient Israelites and the vehicle for the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). Over centuries, Hebrew evolved into Mishnaic and then Medieval Hebrew, followed by Modern Hebrew which is spoken in Israel today.\nThe earliest known Semitic languages include Akkadian and Eblaite. Akkadian, the language of the ancient Akkadian Empire, existed from around 2800 to 500 BCE. Eblaite, spoken in the ancient city-state of Ebla (modern Syria), is known from texts dating back to the 24th century BCE. Another ancient Semitic language is Amorite, which existed from around 2000 to 1600 BCE.\nEspecially Akkadian is interesting in regards to ancient Hebrew as it shares a lot of cognates. The Bible refers to Akkad in Genesis 10:10, which states:\nThe beginning of his Nimrod\u0026rsquo;s kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these are the earliest Semitic languages we have written records for. The actual origins of the Semitic language family likely date back several thousand years earlier, perhaps to the 4th millennium BCE. These origins are largely unrecorded and thus open to speculation.\nRelationship with Sumerian # Sumerian, the language of ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, is considered a language isolate, which means it\u0026rsquo;s not demonstrably related to any other known language. Despite being geographically close to the early Semitic-speaking populations, Sumerian does not belong to the Semitic language family, or for that matter, the larger Afroasiatic language family.\nThe precise origins of the Sumerian language remain a mystery, as does its relationship, if any, to other languages. Several hypotheses have been proposed over the years, suggesting potential connections with various language families or hypothesizing that Sumerian might represent a branch of an ancient, possibly extinct language family, but none have achieved broad acceptance in the scholarly community.\nHowever, Sumerian had a significant influence on Akkadian, a Semitic language, which replaced Sumerian as the lingua franca of Mesopotamia around the turn of the 3rd millennium BCE. Even after Sumerian ceased to be spoken, it continued to be used as a language of education, much as Latin was in medieval Europe, and many Sumerian words, phrases, and grammatical structures were borrowed into Akkadian. But despite this influence, Sumerian and the Semitic languages are fundamentally different in their structure and vocabulary.\nProto-Semitic and Proto-Afroasiatic # Proto-Semitic and Proto-Afroasiatic are the reconstructed ancestors of the Semitic and Afroasiatic language families respectively. Because these languages predate written records, our understanding of them is based on linguistic reconstruction, a technique that involves comparing the features of related languages to infer the properties of their common ancestor.\nProto-Semitic is estimated to have been spoken around the 4th to 3rd millennium BCE, possibly in the Arabian Peninsula or the Levant. Some of its distinctive features include a specific set of consonants known as \u0026ldquo;emphatics,\u0026rdquo; a system of vowel harmony, and a grammar that based words on roots usually consisting of three consonants. Features of Proto-Semitic that it passed onto its descendants include verb aspect (rather than tense) as the primary grammatical category, a tendency towards using derivational morphology (creating words by adding prefixes, infixes, and suffixes to a root), and a triconsonantal root system (most words are built around a root of three consonants).\nProto-Afroasiatic is even older and more speculative. Estimates of when it was spoken range from 12,000 to 18,000 years ago. The original homeland of its speakers is also disputed, with proposals including North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Levant. Proto-Afroasiatic is hypothesized to have had a contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants, a large number of consonants produced with different positions of the tongue, and a rich system of noun inflection (changes in form to indicate grammatical relationships).\nReconstruction of ancestor languages # Understanding the earliest ancestral languages, such as Proto-Semitic or Proto-Afroasiatic, is a complex task that involves meticulous linguistic reconstruction. A key part of this process involves identifying and analyzing the similarities between ancient languages within the same family. Ancient Hebrew, often known as Biblical Hebrew, and Akkadian, the oldest known Semitic language, serve as excellent candidates for such comparative analysis.\nBiblical Hebrew and Akkadian share numerous features indicative of their common Semitic heritage. Their similarities provide invaluable insight into the Proto-Semitic language from which they both descended. For instance, both languages rely on a system of triconsonantal roots, wherein the meaning of a word is primarily determined by three consonants, and the specific nuances are shaped by altering vowels and adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes. This characteristic structure is a defining feature of the Semitic language family.\nAnother shared feature is the use of verb aspect, rather than tense, as the primary grammatical category. This means that these languages tend to express whether an action is ongoing or completed, rather than when it occurs.\nBiblical Hebrew and Akkadian also have similar phonetic properties, including the use of certain emphatic consonants, which further supports their common Semitic origin.\nBy comparing these similarities, linguists can extrapolate backwards to infer the properties of Proto-Semitic. And by extending the analysis to include other ancient Afroasiatic languages outside the Semitic family, they can even make inferences about the even more remote Proto-Afroasiatic.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note, however, that such reconstructions are based on probability and best-fit analyses, and absolute certainty is elusive. Furthermore, the task is complicated by language contact and borrowing, evolution and diversification of languages, and the limited availability of ancient written records. Despite these challenges, the comparative method remains one of the best tools we have for shedding light on the languages of the distant past.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh answers a series of questions that Ra√´l got to ask. One of these questions aimed at what language was spoken among the Elohim themselves:\n‚ÄòWhat language do you speak on your planet?‚Äô\n‚ÄòOur official language closely resembles ancient Hebrew.‚Äô\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn this passage, the answer is short and to the point: the language spoken among the Elohimian civilization is one that has been spoken in the past on planet Earth, it is an ancient version of what we commonly refer to as Hebrew.\nOur take # If we assume that the first human beings during the Age of Leo or perhaps during the Age of Cancer were learning to speak with their Elohimian parent creators, they most likely conversed in a language that was already long established and formalized by their extraterrestrial civilization. We can\u0026rsquo;t know for sure from that short statement how close the actual source language has been to what we consider Biblical or Classical Hebrew. It could be that the antiquity of the language referred to as \u0026ldquo;ancient Hebrew\u0026rdquo; might refer to one of the ancestor languages, such as Proto-Semitic, Proto-Afroasiatic or an yet unexplored ancestor language.\nTable of common Biblical Hebrew words # Biblical Hebrew Meaning ◊û÷∑◊ú÷∞◊ê÷∏◊ö÷∞ (mal\u0026rsquo;√°kh) Messenger, ambadassor, usually translated as angel Table of Semitic cognates # Cognates are words in different languages that share a common etymological origin.

This root carries the basic semantic meaning of the word. Different words are derived from this root by altering the vowels between the consonants and adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes. For example, in Hebrew, the root K-T-B conveys the concept of \u0026lsquo;writing.\u0026rsquo; By changing vowels and adding affixes, it can form words like \u0026lsquo;ketav\u0026rsquo; (script), \u0026lsquo;kotev\u0026rsquo; (writer), \u0026lsquo;kitvei\u0026rsquo; (writings), and \u0026lsquo;kotevet\u0026rsquo; (she writes), among others. The triconsonantal root system allows for a high degree of precision and nuance in Semitic languages.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe concept of \u0026ldquo;tense-aspect\u0026rdquo; in Semitic languages reflects the way these languages express both the time and the state of an action within their verb systems. \u0026ldquo;Tense\u0026rdquo; refers to when an action happens (past, present, future), while \u0026ldquo;aspect\u0026rdquo; describes the state of the action, whether it\u0026rsquo;s complete (perfective) or ongoing (imperfective). In languages like Hebrew, these two elements are interconnected rather than separate. A verb form in these languages doesn\u0026rsquo;t just express aspect or just express tense; instead, it conveys a combined \u0026ldquo;tense-aspect\u0026rdquo; that incorporates both temporal and aspectual information. For example, the Hebrew \u0026lsquo;qatal\u0026rsquo; form represents a past, completed action, while the \u0026lsquo;yiqtol\u0026rsquo; form can represent a future or present, ongoing action. This integration allows for a nuanced depiction of events, reflecting both when they happen and how they unfold.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSince the revival of Modern Hebrew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw influences from several European languages, German being one of them. This influence is especially noticeable in the realm of vocabulary, where Modern Hebrew has incorporated many loanwords from German. Other languages that have strongly influenced Modern Hebrew are Russian and Spanish.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Paleo-Hebrew script, used in the earliest forms of Hebrew, directly evolved from the Phoenician alphabet. This Phoenician script is one of the earliest alphabetic writing systems, believed to have originated from Egyptian hieroglyphs, transforming complex pictorial symbols into a simpler, more abstract and efficient phonetic system. The influence of the Phoenician script extended far beyond the Semitic world. The Greeks adapted the Phoenician script to their language, adding vowel symbols, and from there, it passed to the Etruscans, and then to the Romans. The Latin script, used in the majority of the world\u0026rsquo;s languages today, including English, evolved from this Roman adaptation, making the Phoenician script, and by extension the Paleo-Hebrew script, a distant ancestor of our modern alphabet.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe square script, also known as the Assyrian, Aramaic, or Jewish script, came into use around the 5th century BCE following the Babylonian exile, when Aramaic became the lingua franca of the region. Aramaic was written in this square script, and its use gradually spread to Hebrew as well.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":"122","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%B8%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%83%D1%81/","title":"–ò–∏—Å—É—Å","description":"–ò–∏—Å—É—Å –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Å, –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ –í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –•—Ä–∞–º–∞ –∏ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–º –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–º –ï–≤–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª–∏–π. –ü–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –Ω–∏–º –±—ã–ª–∞ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∞ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫–∞–∫ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ –∏ —à–∏—Ä–µ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç—å –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –¥–ª—è –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –≠–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è, –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –í–µ–∫, –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–æ–≤, –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω–∏—Ç –≤—Å–µ, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º—ã –Ω–∞—á–Ω–µ–º –ø–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—è—Ç—å —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª —Å–µ–±—è –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ –ë—ã—Ç–∏—è.","content":"Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and one of the most important figures in world history.

He is believed to have lived a sinless life, performed many miracles, and taught about God\u0026rsquo;s love and the coming of the Kingdom of God.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; teachings, as recorded in the Gospels of the New Testament, have had a profound impact on Western civilization and continue to shape the lives of millions of people today. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, Jesus made it possible for people to have a relationship with God and be forgiven of their sins.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; life and teachings are central to the Christian faith, and he is worshipped as Lord and Savior by Christians around the world.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; life # Jesus\u0026rsquo; life and teachings are recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. According to the Gospels, Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea to Mary and Joseph, and was baptized by John the Baptist.\nAfter his baptism, Jesus began a ministry of preaching and healing that lasted about three years. He traveled throughout Galilee and Judea, teaching about God\u0026rsquo;s love and the coming of the Kingdom of God, and performing miracles such as healing the sick, casting out demons, and feeding the hungry.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; teachings and miracles caused controversy among the religious leaders of his day, who saw him as a threat to their power and status. He was eventually arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion.\nAfter his death, Jesus\u0026rsquo; followers claimed that he had risen from the dead and appeared to them, providing evidence of his divine nature and fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. The accounts of his resurrection form the foundation of the Christian faith and the belief in eternal life.\nThroughout his ministry, Jesus emphasized God\u0026rsquo;s love and the importance of loving one another. He also taught about the need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins, and offered a message of hope and salvation to all who believe in him.

The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:\nShe was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\n‚Äî Matthew 1: 18.\nMary was the woman chosen, and obviously her fiance found these tidings hard to accept, but:\nBehold, the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him.\n‚Äî Matthew 1:20.\nOne of the creators appeared to explain that Mary would bring forth a son of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;.

The prophets, who were in contact with the creators, came from far away to see the divine child, and one of the spacecrafts of the creators guided them. The creators watched over the child and told Joseph to flee to Egypt until King Herod died, after which they told him to return to Israel.\nThen Jesus told his apostles that they must spread the truth throughout the world. In the prayer called the \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Our Father\u0026rdquo;, the truth is stated literally:\nThy kingdom come.

The torch will be taken up again.\nThis prayer, which has been repeated time and time again without anyone understanding its profound meaning, now takes on its full significance: On Earth, as it is in heaven.\nIn this passage, Jesus tells his apostles to spread the truth throughout the world, and the prayer known as the \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer\u0026rdquo; includes the statement \u0026ldquo;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\u0026rdquo; The text suggests that on the creators\u0026rsquo; planet, the scientists eventually became the ruling group and created other intelligent beings, and this same pattern will be followed on Earth. The passage emphasizes the profound meaning of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer and the idea that Earth will become like heaven. It also suggests that the same will happen on Earth, and the prayer\u0026rsquo;s message will take on its full significance when the truth is realized on Earth.\nIn St. Matthew\u0026rsquo;s Gospel, Chapter 26, Jesus reveals the importance of his death and of the writings, which would later serve as proof.

Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\n‚Äî Matthew 26: 52-54.\nIt was in fact necessary for Jesus to die in order for the truth to be known throughout the world so that later on, when your creators return to Earth, they are not taken for usurpers or invaders. That is the purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings: to preserve traces of the work and presence of your creators, so that they will be recognized when they return.\nIn St. Matthew\u0026rsquo;s Gospel, Chapter 26, Jesus explains the importance of his death and the writings that will serve as proof. He emphasizes the need for him to die to ensure that the truth is known throughout the world, and to prevent the creators from being taken for invaders or usurpers when they return to Earth. The purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings is to preserve traces of the creators\u0026rsquo; work and presence, so that they can be recognized when they return.\nThe creators took care of Jesus and revived him. And he said:\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations\u0026hellip; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\n‚Äî Matthew 28: 19-20.\nJesus\u0026rsquo; mission was coming to an end:\nSo then after Jesus16 had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven.\n‚Äî Mark 16: 19.\nThe creators took him away after this last most important phrase:\nThey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n‚Äî Mark 16: 18.\nThis refers to humanity discovering anti-venom serums and antidotes, and developing surgery and so on ‚Äî as is happening now.\nIn preparation for their arrival on Earth, the creators will appear more and more frequently, in order to highlight these revelations.\nThis also is happening right now.\nBehold the fig tree\u0026hellip; When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.\n‚Äî Luke 21: 29-30.\nWhen unidentified flying objects begin appearing in large numbers, as they are doing at present, it means that the time has come. In the Acts of the Apostles, it says, furthermore, in Chapter 2:\nAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues\u0026hellip;\n‚Äî Acts 2: 1-4.\nTo make it possible for the apostles to spread the truth throughout the world, the creators exposed them to a concentrated burst of teaching sent to them by amplified telepathic waves, a little like electro-shocks, which impregnated their memories with elements of other languages.\nIn this passage, it is explained that Jesus\u0026rsquo; mission on Earth was to spread the truth of the creators and to prepare humanity for their return. After his resurrection, Jesus commanded his apostles to teach all nations and observe his teachings. Jesus was then taken away by the creators after sharing important revelations about the progress of humanity. The passage states that the creators will appear more frequently to highlight their revelations and that the increase in UFO sightings is a sign that their arrival is approaching.

It teaches that there are ten divine emanations from God and the purpose of creation. It also includes meditative and magical practices to achieve union with God. The Kabbalah has roots in early Jewish mysticism that date back to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, but its written form began to develop in the late 12th and early 13th centuries in Provence and Spain. The classic texts of Kabbalah, such as \u0026ldquo;The Book of Creation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Zohar,\u0026rdquo; were written in the late 12th to early 14th centuries.\nThe main books of Kabbalah include:\n\u0026ldquo;Sefer Yetzirah\u0026rdquo; (Book of Creation) \u0026ldquo;The Zohar\u0026rdquo; (Book of Splendor) \u0026ldquo;The Bahir\u0026rdquo; (Book of Brightness) \u0026ldquo;Etz Chaim\u0026rdquo; (Tree of Life) \u0026ldquo;Sefer Ha-Razim\u0026rdquo; (Book of Mysteries) \u0026ldquo;Sefer Ha-Hezyonot\u0026rdquo; (Book of Visions) Some of the most well-known and influential Kabbalistic texts were written by Spanish Kabbalists such as Moses de Leon (who is credited with writing \u0026ldquo;The Zohar\u0026rdquo;), Isaac Luria (known as the Ari), and Shlomo Alkabetz. Other important figures in the development of Kabbalah include the German Kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin and the 16th-century Safed school of Kabbalists led by Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria. Kabbalah is still considered an important part of Jewish spirituality and culture by many Jews today. Its teachings and practices continue to influence contemporary spirituality and have inspired new interpretations and adaptations in various spiritual traditions. Additionally, Kabbalah has had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, literature, and the arts. While it is primarily a form of Jewish mysticism, its ideas and practices have also been adopted and studied by individuals from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.\nThe Zohar # The Zohar is a central text in the Kabbalah. It was written in medieval Spain in the 13th century and is said to contain the secret wisdom of the Torah. The Zohar is written in Aramaic and is a commentary on the Torah, the Hebrew Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament).\nThe Zohar\u0026rsquo;s central teaching is that God\u0026rsquo;s essence is not fully revealed in the physical world and that only through mystical contemplation and study can one truly understand the divine. It teaches that the universe was created through ten sefirot, which are emanations of God\u0026rsquo;s attributes and energy.\nThe Zohar is structured in the form of a running commentary on the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. It takes the form of a dialogue between the mystics Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his disciples, who discuss and interpret the meaning of various verses and passages in the Torah.\nIn addition to the commentary on the Torah, the Zohar also contains homilies, parables, and allegories that elaborate on its central teachings. The text is divided into several sections, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the divine realm, such as the sefirot (the ten attributes of God), the creation of the world, and the nature of the soul.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his book The Coming of the Gods, in a subchapter about \u0026ldquo;Rationalism and the Tradition\u0026rdquo;, Jean Sendy writes the following about the origins and meaning of the Kabbalah:\nRationality is what will made it possible to send men to the moon, to prepare to send men to Mars, to consider dispersing the opaque clouds under which Venus is hidden, to send \u0026ldquo;the spirit of man\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;move upon the face of the waters\u0026rdquo; under which Venus is \u0026ldquo;without form, and void,\u0026rdquo; and to prepare the methods and means that may some day bring it to pass that there will \u0026ldquo;be light\u0026rdquo; on Venus also.\nAre we on the verge of \u0026ldquo;renewing the acts related at the beginning of Genesis?\u0026rsquo; It would seem so, judging from what leading scientists and technicians believe and say. But scientists and technicians do not necessarily read the Bible or practice the Cabala, that \u0026ldquo;oral teaching\u0026rdquo; for which the Bible is the equivalent of a detailed outline intended to help students understand a college lecture course.\n\u0026ldquo;The message preserved by the Cabala concerns the correspondence between the two worlds, celestial and earthly, and their unification by man. [\u0026hellip;] Man will renew the acts related at the beginning of Genesis,\u0026rdquo; writes Alexandre Safran, Grand Rabbi of Geneva, in La Kabale (Payot), where he also states that \u0026ldquo;the Cabala goes back to prehistoric times; Moses only introduced it into the history of Israel.\u0026rdquo;\nIs it only a coincidence, this conjunction between science and the Cabala whose roots go back into the depths of time common to the myths of all the First Civilizations? Is it more rational to see it is a fulfilment of the \u0026ldquo;prophecy\u0026rdquo; that the Cabala describes as having been brought \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo; by the \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; Whose acts are related in the Bible, as was known by every man with a little education in Voltaire\u0026rsquo;s time?\nSome of our most renowned scientists are already seeking beyond the solar system for concrete evidence of other civilizations, whose existence seems to them probable enough to justify their efforts. [\u0026hellip;]\nHere, Sendy first argues that rationality and science have allowed humans to explore and study the cosmos, and that some scientists and technicians are beginning to believe in the possibility of life on other planets. Sendy then goes on and speculates by quoting the Grand Rabbi of Geneva Alexandre Safran that the connection between science and the Kabbalah may not be a coincidence, and that the Kabbalah\u0026rsquo;s description of \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; bringing their knowledge from the sky and renewing the acts related to the beginning of Genesis may actually be a prophecy that science is fulfilling.\nAccording to Alexandre Safran # As stated before Jean Sendy refers several times throughout his work to Alexandre Safran. In doing so he highlights the circumstance that a leading figure in the Jewish community such as Alexandre Safran was identifying the Kabbalistic tradition that preserved Elohimian wisdom over the ages that goes back further than Moses and his Jewish religion itself.\nAlexandre Safran (1915-2006) was a Romanian-Swiss rabbi and scholar who served as the Chief Rabbi of Geneva and the Chairman of the Executive of the World Jewish Congress. He was a prominent figure in the Jewish community and worked to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding between different religious groups. Safran was particularly interested in the Kabbalah and its role in Jewish mysticism, and he wrote several books on the subject, including \u0026ldquo;The Mysteries of the Kabbalah\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Kabbalah and the Spiritual Quest\u0026rdquo;.\nSendy often refers to Alexandre Safran, the Grand Rabbi of Geneva, who himself authored a treatise named \u0026ldquo;La Cabale\u0026rdquo; and got published in 1960. Therein, the very nature of the Kabbalah as a tradition is explained. A famous quote from Alexandre Safran that is found throughout Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work refers to an important passage in \u0026ldquo;La Cabale\u0026rdquo; where Kabbalah is thought to preserve the notion that man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis:\nThe Kabbalah creates values inspired by the Bible because it contains vital biblical forces upon which its existence and flourishing depend. It calls these forces to the surface, where they appear in their biblical originality despite the \u0026ldquo;clothes\u0026rdquo; they assume to act better in a given historical environment. The message offered by the Kabbalah concerns the correspondence of the two worlds, celestial and earthly, and their unification by man: they will be merged and form a unique world. This message is delivered in the \u0026ldquo;history of the heavens and the earth\u0026rdquo; and in the \u0026ldquo;history of man,\u0026rdquo; who \u0026ldquo;struggles\u0026rdquo; against the \u0026ldquo;forces of below\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;forces of above\u0026rdquo; to make the ideal that was instilled in him triumph: Israel.\nThanks to the victory of man, the descriptive natural history, the result of the original sin, will give way to a creative and transformative history of nature. The latter will then be put at the service of ethics and \u0026ldquo;generate\u0026rdquo; the good deeds of the renewed man, aided in his task by all creatures. \u0026ldquo;Ze sefer told√≤th ad√†m,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;this is the story of man\u0026rsquo;s genealogy.\u0026rdquo; In its messianic edition, this account will be identified with the told√≤th ha-sham√†im ve-ha-arez, the \u0026ldquo;genealogy of heaven and earth,\u0026rdquo; for they too, like man, will have their told√≤tb, their \u0026ldquo;genealogy,\u0026rdquo; their history in accordance with the Creator\u0026rsquo;s will. Such was the plan established \u0026ldquo;when the Eternal God made the heavens and the earth,\u0026rdquo; but also \u0026ldquo;on the day He created man\u0026rdquo; (Gen).\nIn the messianic edition of these told√≤th, \u0026ldquo;the wolf and the lamb\u0026rdquo; will be seen dwelling together in a creative peace in which material strength is put at the service of moral good. Man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis.\nAlso, the following passage from the same book contextualizes the Kabbalah even further as a chain of Tradition:\nAt the root of the Kabbalah, there is a first Revelation. But this Revelation must be renewed for every generation, for every man, who leads it to acts whose scope is very great, reaches cosmic dimensions, and even engages divinity. They determine God\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the world and with man.\nThe Mishnah provides the historical outline of the Kabbalah in this way: \u0026ldquo;Moses received (kibbev: from this term derives Kabbalah) the Torah, the Teaching, the Law) on Mount Sinai; he transmitted it (Hu-mesara) to Joshua; he passed it on to the Elders; they communicated it to the prophets, and the latter transmitted it to the members of the Great Congregation.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Kabbalah exceeds, in antiquity, the Revelation of Sinai; it dates back to prehistoric times. Moses only introduced it into the history of Israel.\nThe Kabbalah therefore goes beyond the boundaries of a religious mystique; it is infinitely more extensive than an esoteric tradition. The Torah is not its precise and extensive object. The latter was, from the beginning, applied by those who had discovered it thanks to their religious intuition and only later received its written form, the Mosaic Law. Israel has become its bearer. The designation commonly attributed to Kabbalah is shalshelet ha-Kabbalah or \u0026ldquo;chain of Tradition.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Kabbalah can therefore be understood as a chain of tradition that extends beyond the boundaries of a religious mystique and dates back to prehistoric times, which has been transmitted to different generations and engages divinity to determine God\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the world and with man.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Fifth Chapter \u0026ldquo;The End of the World\u0026rdquo;, Section \u0026ldquo;At the Roots of All Religions\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh mentions the Kabbalah as being a body of mystical traditions that is rich in allusions to our Creators, the Elohim:\nIt is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.\nIf one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. [\u0026hellip;]\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another passage that worthwhile to point out. It can be considered to resonate with what Jean Sendy has been suggesting through the interpretation and exegesis by the Grand Rabbi of Geneva Alexandre Safran of the essence of Kabbalah, namely that that the Kabbalah is ultimately about preserving the notion that man will renew the acts recounted at the beginning of Genesis:\nFor a long time, humanity has held the truth in its hands but could not understand until it was sufficiently evolved scientifically to decode it.\nEvery man is brutish in his knowledge15\u0026hellip; Jeremiah 10: 14.\nScience enabled the creators to create and will enable human beings to do the same.\nYahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was\u0026hellip; When he prepared the heavens, I was there\u0026hellip; When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment\u0026hellip; Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. Proverbs 8: 22-23, 27, 29 -31.\nIntelligence and science, these are the two virtues that enabled the creators to create the landmass - the single continent - and the living beings they placed upon it. And now this intelligence and this spirit leads the human brain to repeat the acts of their creators. Since the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:\nThat which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. Ecclesiastes 3: 15.\nThe animals were also created and will be recreated. Just like human beings, no more, no less. The species that disappear will live again when you know how to recreate them:\nSo that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

According to the story, God saw that the world had become corrupt and wicked, and decided to cleanse it with a great flood. He chose Noah, a righteous man, to build an ark and gather two of every kind of animal and bird, as well as his family, to survive the flood.\nNoah obeyed God\u0026rsquo;s instructions and built the ark, which was made of gopher wood and coated with pitch. When the animals were all gathered, God closed the door of the ark, and the flood began. The rain lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, and the waters rose so high that even the highest mountains were covered.\nEveryone and everything on the earth, except for those on the ark, perished in the flood. After the rain stopped and the waters receded, Noah released a dove from the ark to find dry land. The dove eventually returned with an olive branch, signifying the end of the flood and the start of a new beginning.\nGod then made a covenant, or a promise, with Noah never to destroy the earth with a flood again. He set a rainbow in the sky as a symbol of this promise.\nThe story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark is considered by many as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s power and mercy, and is still widely known and retold today.\nEtymology # In the Biblical source text, the word which is being used to describe Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark is ◊™◊ô◊ë◊™ ◊†◊ó (tev√°t noa·∏•). The word for Ark, ◊™◊ô◊ë◊™ (tev√°t or tev√°) signifies box or chest.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark is mentioned by Yahweh. The following reference from Rael\u0026rsquo;s first book, The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, showcases the mentioning of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark:\n[\u0026hellip;] However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.\nThis was true figuratively speaking, but in reality -and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this- a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.\nWhen the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.\nThe ark\u0026hellip; was lift up above the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 7: 17.\nAs you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water.\nThen it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:\nAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n‚Äî Genesis 7: 24.\nThe spacecraft had three sections:\n[\u0026hellip;] and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n‚Äî Genesis 6: 16.\nLater it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.\nIn this passage, it is explained that the creators in exile, who were monitoring Earth, were aware of the impending cataclysm, the Great Flood, and the need to preserve life on Earth. They asked Noah to build a spaceship or an ark, which would orbit the Earth during the disaster, and contain a pair of each species that needed to be preserved. It is then explained that a single living cell of each species is all that is required to recreate a whole being.\nThe ark was lifted \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the Earth and not \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; the water, and it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout. The spacecraft had three sections and carried a couple from each race of human beings on Earth. Eventually, it landed on Earth and the survivors, both human and non-human, were released to start a new life. The story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark can be understood as a life preservation project that safeguarded life during the Great Flood.\nLegacy # Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark is an integral component of the Adamite struggle and the Serpentine rebellion narrative. It is not the wooden ship as traditionally conceived in popular culture, but rather a state-of-the-art spacecraft, designed and built with the help of the exiled Elohim, who were in defiance of their home government\u0026rsquo;s decision to exterminate all life on Earth.\nThe construction of the Ark represents an act of defiance and a bold assertion of humanity\u0026rsquo;s right to survival. It was designed to sustain a select group of humans, including Noah and his family, and various animal species through a cataclysm meant to wipe out life on Earth. To this end, it was equipped with advanced life-support systems and the genetic codes of various animal species. These genetic codes ensured the preservation and regeneration of biodiversity post-catastrophe.\nDuring the cataclysm, the Ark, carrying its precious cargo of human and animal life, orbited Earth, safely out of reach of the destructive forces ravaging the planet. After the cataclysm ended, Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark returned to Earth, allowing its passengers to repopulate the planet and breathe life back into the devastated ecosystem.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Flood Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Gemini External links # Noah\u0026#39;s Ark | Wikipedia Ark of Noah | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"128","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D1%8D%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è","description":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ —Ü–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É, –ø–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—è—é—â–µ–º—É—Å—è —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—é –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –≤–æ –í—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç—ã–º–∏ —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è–º–∏. –û–Ω –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–º–∫–∏ –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏, –ø–æ–¥—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏–≤–∞—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω –∏ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≥—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏. –ö–∞–∂–¥–æ–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–µ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —à–∞–≥ –≤–ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥, —Ö–æ—Ç—è –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑—É –¥–ª—è –∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π. –≠—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ü–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π —Å–º–µ—Å—å –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤ –∏ —Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–ª–∞ –≤ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –≤ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ.","content":"In Ra√´lism üîØ # \u0026ldquo;Cosmic evolution,\u0026rdquo; as depicted in Ra√´lism, transcends the traditional understanding of evolution being a solely natural and biological process. Here, evolution also embodies the notion of an iterative and deliberate progression in the creation of intelligent life forms - a process consciously driven by these cosmic creators, from the Forerunners to the Elohim.\nThis process, as described in the quoted passage from The Book Which Tells The Truth, has seen each subsequent creation of a humanoid civilization incorporating gradual improvements, an act akin to an artist refining their technique with each new masterpiece. The creators, starting from the Forerunners, continuously honed their knowledge and techniques, enabling them to create increasingly sophisticated life forms over time.\nEach new version of \u0026lsquo;humanity\u0026rsquo; is a testament to this iterative refinement, reflecting small enhancements that contribute to a grand process of evolution across the cosmos. This \u0026lsquo;designed evolution\u0026rsquo; differs from natural evolution in its purposefulness and speed, being not a product of random mutations and natural selection over eons, but a result of deliberate design and creation.\nMoreover, this evolution is not only physical but also intellectual and cultural. The creators didn\u0026rsquo;t just aspire to perfect the physical forms of their creations, but also to imbue them with increased intelligence and the capacity for sophisticated thought. They aimed to create beings who would not only survive but also thrive, appreciate their origins, and potentially continue this lineage of creation themselves.\nHowever, this \u0026lsquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rsquo; also involves an element of risk. As creations become more advanced, they might pose a potential threat to their creators. This concern underlies the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s hesitations about humanity on Earth, which is seen as possibly being slightly superior to their fathers. Despite this, the majority of the Elohim hope that humanity will prove its worthiness of the heritage it has received.\nIn conclusion, this model of \u0026lsquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rsquo; depicts an intriguing blend of natural processes and deliberate design, highlighting the progression and potential of life not just on Earth, but across the cosmos. It presents a vision where intelligent life forms, starting from the Forerunners, have continually refined and enhanced life\u0026rsquo;s blueprint, contributing to a grand, cosmic lineage of creators and creations.\nThe mystery of abiogenesis # Traditional understanding of evolution primarily revolves around the concept of natural selection and random mutations over vast spans of time, where life forms adapt, diversify, and grow more complex due to environmental pressures. This process begins with a simple form of life, which, over billions of years, results in the vast diversity and complexity of life we observe today. However, this traditional concept of evolution doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the origin of life itself, the process known as abiogenesis.\nAbiogenesis pertains to how life arises from non-living matter, such as molecules containing carbon and other elements. It is essentially the process that \u0026ldquo;kick-starts\u0026rdquo; the evolutionary machinery. While various theories exist, the exact mechanisms and conditions under which life first originated on Earth remain unclear.\nIn contrast, the concept of Cosmic Evolution as depicted in Ra√´lism involves a purposeful, conscious process of life creation and refinement by advanced civilizations. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of \u0026lsquo;directed evolution\u0026rsquo;, where each successive creation represents an advancement over the previous one. But while this provides an intriguing explanation for the progression and diversity of life, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily solve the problem of abiogenesis either.\nThe issue arises from the question: How did the original creators - the Forerunners - come into existence? If they themselves were created by another civilization, who created that civilization, and so on? This leads to an infinite regress problem unless there\u0026rsquo;s a starting point - a civilization that arose spontaneously from non-living matter, essentially abiogenesis.\nThus, while Cosmic Evolution provides a novel perspective on life\u0026rsquo;s progression and the role of intelligent life forms in it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly address the underlying mystery of how life originates from non-life. This remains a fundamental question in both traditional evolutionary biology and alternative perspectives such as Ra√´lism.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Forerunners Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Intelligent Design Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering "},{"id":"129","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC/","title":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–ª—é—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–º","description":"–ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–ª—é—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–º, —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π –∏–¥–µ—é –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≤ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–Ω–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –º–∏—Ä—ã. –Ø–≤–Ω–∞—è –Ω–µ–æ–±—ä—è—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–∞ –≤ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç —ç—Ç—É –∏–¥–µ—é.","content":"Cosmic pluralism refers to the idea that it is possible for intelligent life to exist on other planets in the universe, beyond our own. The concept of extraterrestrial life and the search for it has been a topic of human fascination for thousands of years, with early civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese all imagining the existence of life on other planets.\nWith the advancement of science and technology, the search for extraterrestrial life has become a serious scientific endeavor, with many projects and initiatives dedicated to finding evidence of life elsewhere in the universe. For example, the search for exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) has been a focus of astronomy for several decades, and has resulted in the discovery of thousands of exoplanets to date.\nThe discovery of exoplanets has increased the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial life, as it has revealed the vast number of potentially habitable planets in the universe. In addition, the study of astrobiology has provided new insights into the conditions necessary for life to arise and flourish, and has revealed that life can exist in extreme environments that were previously thought to be inhospitable.\nThe idea of cosmic pluralism in this context is important because it challenges traditional views of our place in the universe and expands our understanding of the possibilities of life beyond our own planet. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and our own place in it, and would likely lead to new scientific and technological advancements.\nEpicurus # Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, did relate to the idea of cosmic pluralism in the sense that he believed in the existence of multiple worlds. Epicurus was a proponent of atomism, the idea that all matter is made up of indivisible particles called atoms. He believed that the universe was infinite and that atoms were constantly in motion, colliding and forming new things. He also believed that there were an infinite number of worlds, each with its own unique properties and characteristics.\nEpicurus saw the existence of multiple worlds as a natural consequence of the infinite size of the universe and the random motion of atoms. He believed that there were an infinite number of possibilities for the arrangement of atoms and that, as a result, there must be an infinite number of worlds.\nEpicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was motivated by his desire to address the question of why our world appeared to be so well suited for life. If there were an infinite number of worlds, he argued, it was likely that at least one of them would be hospitable to life. In this way, Epicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was a form of cosmic pluralism, in that it recognized the existence of multiple possibilities beyond our own world.\nIn conclusion, Epicurus\u0026rsquo; belief in multiple worlds was a form of cosmic pluralism that was grounded in his atomic philosophy and was motivated by a desire to explain the apparent fine-tuning of our world for life. His ideas laid the foundation for the development of atomism and influenced later philosophers and scientists who explored the idea of multiple worlds and the nature of the universe.\nGiordano Bruno # Giordano Bruno, the Italian philosopher and astronomer, was a strong advocate of cosmic pluralism in the sense of multiple inhabited worlds. He believed that the universe was infinite and that there were an infinite number of worlds, each with its own suns, stars, and planets, and that many of these worlds were inhabited by intelligent beings.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s beliefs were a significant departure from the prevailing views of his time, which held that the Earth was the center of the universe and that there were only a limited number of celestial bodies. He rejected these views and instead argued for a heliocentric model of the universe, in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth and other planets revolved around it.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s ideas were heavily influenced by the ancient philosopher Epicurus, who also believed in the existence of multiple worlds, and by the works of the Polish astronomer Copernicus, who argued for a heliocentric model of the universe.\nIn addition to his views on multiple inhabited worlds, Bruno also believed that the universe was infinite and that there was no boundary to the extent of space. He saw the universe as a homogeneous and infinite expanse, filled with an infinite number of stars and planets, each with its own unique properties and characteristics.\nBruno\u0026rsquo;s beliefs were not well received in his time and he was eventually put on trial by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy. He was eventually burned at the stake for his views, which were considered a threat to the authority of the Church.\nDespite the tragic end to his life, Bruno\u0026rsquo;s ideas had a profound impact on the scientific and philosophical community and paved the way for future scientists and philosophers to explore the concept of cosmic pluralism. His beliefs in multiple inhabited worlds, the infinity of the universe, and the heliocentric model of the universe were highly controversial in his time, but have since become widely accepted as part of our modern understanding of the universe.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to Ra√´lian teachings, the Elohim are believed to have created life on other planets as well, and may have communicated with humans throughout history, including in religious texts such as the Bible. Ra√´lism therefore places a strong emphasis on the idea of cosmic pluralism, and believes that humans should be open to the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms.\nFurthermore, Ra√´lism sees the creation of life on other planets as part of a larger cosmic plan that aims to bring humanity to a higher level of consciousness and enlightenment. The movement believes that humans have the potential to evolve into a new species with a greater capacity for love, wisdom, and harmony. This transformation is seen as part of a larger cosmic plan that in the context of the chain of humanaity is guided by the Elohim, who are believed to be working towards the betterment of humanity and therefore preserve the chain of life of the human species.\nAs stated in his book The Book Which Tells The Truth, Yehowah tells us that life propagates throughout the universe by civilization advanced enough to engineer and create new life on other planets:\nSince the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:\nThat which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. Ecclesiastes 3: 15.\nIn summary, Ra√´lism incorporates the idea of cosmic pluralism into its religious beliefs, viewing the existence of intelligent life on other planets as the very reality. This belief is central to the movement\u0026rsquo;s teachings and emphasizes the importance of being open to the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Astrobiology Wiki ‚Ä∫ Drake equation Wiki ‚Ä∫ Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Plurality of Gods External links # Cosmic pluralism | Wikipedia Pluralistic cosmologies | Britannica "},{"id":"130","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%85/","title":"–ö—Ä—É–≥–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—è—Ö","description":"–ö—Ä—É–≥–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—è—Ö ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—ã–µ —É–∑–æ—Ä—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø–æ—è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—è—Ö —Å –ø–æ—Å–µ–≤–∞–º–∏. –û–Ω–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω—ã —Å —É—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–µ–π –∏–∑-–∑–∞ –≤–µ—Ä—ã –≤ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏–∑ –Ω–∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω—ã –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç—ã–º —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–æ–º. –≠—Ç–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Å–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏. –•–æ—Ç—è –±—ã–ª–æ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∫—Ä—É–≥–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—è—Ö —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —Ä—É–∫–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–º–∏ –º–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π, —Å–ø–æ—Ä—ã –æ–± –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –≤ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —É—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏.","content":"Crop circles, or crop formations, refer to sizable patterns created by the flattening of crops such as wheat, barley, rapeseed (canola), rye, corn, linseed, and soy. The phenomenon is global but is most prevalent in the United Kingdom, where the majority of formations have been reported since the 1970s. While some attribute crop circles to various unexplained phenomena, others believe they are man-made. This article explores the history, characteristics, proposed explanations, and cultural impact of crop circles.\nHistory # The documented history of crop circles traces back to the 17th century, with arguably the earliest recorded instance in a woodcut from 1678 known as the \u0026ldquo;Mowing Devil.\u0026rdquo; This account describes a farmer who, refusing to pay the price demanded by a laborer to mow his field, allegedly stated that he\u0026rsquo;d rather the Devil did it. The following morning, the field was found to be perfectly mowed in a manner that no human could replicate.\nHowever, the phenomenon as we know it today started to gain widespread attention in the late 1970s in the English county of Hampshire. The circles began to appear in greater numbers, with more complex patterns forming over time. This increase led to the term \u0026ldquo;crop circle\u0026rdquo; being coined in the early 1980s.\nCharacteristics # Crop circles are defined by their intricate and precise patterns. They can range in diameter from a few meters to several hundred meters, occasionally covering areas as large as 80,000 sq. meters. While early formations were simple circles, over the decades, these designs have evolved into complex geometrical, mathematical, and symbolic formations, often displaying a high degree of symmetry.\nMany reports note that the affected crops appear to be laid flat, flowing in a consistent direction, without any visible signs of physical damage such as broken stalks, that would be expected from mechanical flattening. Instead, the stalks appear bent, typically at the base, or at the nodes.\nList of famous crop circles # Here are several notable historical accounts of phenomena akin to modern crop circles:\nThe Mowing Devil (1678): This is one of the earliest recorded instances of a crop circle-like phenomenon. In a woodcut from this year, a strange circle is seen in a field of oats after a farmer supposedly said he\u0026rsquo;d \u0026ldquo;rather pay the Devil himself\u0026rdquo; to cut his oat field than his neighbor. The accompanying text recounts that the field was found to be perfectly mowed by an unknown entity overnight.\nTully Saucer Nests (1966): In Tully, Queensland, Australia, a farmer reported seeing a flying saucer rise from a swampy area before flying away. When he went to investigate the location where he saw the saucer, he found a roughly circular area of flattened reeds and grass, which he reported to local police. The circles became known as \u0026ldquo;Tully Saucer Nests\u0026rdquo; and are one of the most famous historical instances of potential crop circles.\nWarminster \u0026ldquo;Thing\u0026rdquo; (1965): During the 1960s and 1970s, the town of Warminster in England became a hotbed of UFO sightings and strange phenomena. One such event involved an unexplained noise that was so powerful it caused buildings to shake and tiles to fall off roofs. In the fields around the town, locals found patches of flattened crops, which some have retrospectively likened to crop circles.\nLunarville 7, Saskatchewan, Canada (1973): In this case, six circular impressions over an area 32.5 meters in diameter were reported. This case also involved high radiation readings, dead plants, and sightings of two disc-shaped objects.\nThe Barbury Castle Crop Circle (1991): This crop circle appeared in Wiltshire, England, and represented a complex geometric figure that some interpreted as a pictorial representation of mathematical concepts.\nThe Julia Set Crop Circle (1996): This formation appeared near Stonehenge, England. It was remarkable for its fractal pattern based on a mathematical figure known as the Julia Set. What added to the intrigue was that it reportedly appeared in broad daylight within a span of 45 minutes, although this claim is disputed.\nThe Etchilhampton Crop Circle (1997): Appearing in Wiltshire, England, this formation stood out for its fractal patterns, which were indicative of a high degree of mathematical understanding.\nThe Milk Hill Crop Circle (2001): Located in Wiltshire, England, this is one of the most complex crop circles ever discovered. It consisted of 409 circles and spanned across a 780-foot area.\nThe Chilbolton \u0026lsquo;Arecibo message\u0026rsquo; Crop Circle (2001): This appeared in Hampshire, England. Its design resembled the binary code of the Arecibo Message sent into space in 1974, which led to speculation that it might be an extraterrestrial response.\nThe Crabwood \u0026lsquo;Alien Face\u0026rsquo; Crop Circle (2002): This intricate formation in Hampshire, England, depicted what looked like an alien face and a disk with a binary code message. The code was claimed to translate to a cryptic message about humanity and its potential for growth or destruction.\nThe Wayland\u0026rsquo;s Smithy Crop Circle (2006): A massive formation near Oxfordshire, England, this crop circle was noteworthy for its complex geometric pattern that required significant precision to create.\nThe Avebury Manor Crop Circle (2008): Located near Avebury, England, this crop circle depicted a representation of our solar system, aligning with the planets\u0026rsquo; positions on December 21, 2012, a date associated with various doomsday prophecies.\nThe West Kennett Long Barrow formation (2010): This detailed crop circle near Wiltshire, England, was said to be an intricate depiction of a lunar cycle.\nCley Hill, Warminster (2017): A large and intricate pattern emerged in the fields of Cley Hill near Warminster. The design contained a mix of geometric and organic forms, drawing significant attention for its beauty and complexity.\nAckling Dyke, Dorset (2018): A beautifully designed crop circle appeared near Ackling Dyke. The formation was comprised of a central circle surrounded by a pattern reminiscent of ancient symbols.\nYatesbury Field, Wiltshire (2019): This crop circle displayed an intricate design of a six-petal flower with an elaborate outer ring. Its symmetry and precision sparked much discussion and admiration.\nWoolstone Wells, Oxfordshire (2020): This formation featured an eye-catching geometric pattern that resembles the \u0026lsquo;flower of life\u0026rsquo; symbol from sacred geometry.\nLong Wood, Hampshire (2021): Appearing in a field near Long Wood, this crop circle was composed of an elaborate pattern of triangles and circles, which creates a three-dimensional cube effect when viewed from above.\nThe Arecibo message case # The Arecibo message is a radio message sent towards the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years away, from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in 1974. Devised by Frank Drake, with input from Carl Sagan and others, it was intended as a demonstration of human technological achievement rather than an actual attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. The message was transmitted only once via frequency modulated radio waves at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope.\nThe message # The content of the Arecibo message is formatted as a bitmap image that, if arranged into a grid of 73 rows by 23 columns, forms a pictorial representation of key facets of Earth and humanity. From top to bottom, the message contains:\nThe numbers one (1) to ten (10). The atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA. A graphic of DNA\u0026rsquo;s double helix structure. A figure of a human, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Earth. A graphic of the Solar System indicating which of the planets the message is coming from. A graphic of the Arecibo radio telescope and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish. The alleged response # In August 2001, a crop circle appeared in a field next to the Chilbolton radio telescope in Hampshire, UK, which some claimed to be a response to the Arecibo message. The formation was similar to the original Arecibo transmission but contained several distinct alterations. The claimed differences include:\nThe numbers 1 to 10 appear in the same format as the original message. Silicon was added to the list of elements important to life. The structure of the DNA was slightly different. The figure representing life from the sender\u0026rsquo;s place was not human, but a smaller being with a large head. The population was listed as much larger than that of Earth. The Solar System graphic was adjusted to indicate that the third, fourth, and fifth planets from the sun were capable of supporting life, and that the message sender was from the third, fourth, or fifth planet. The image of the telescope was replaced by a different structure, possibly representing the technology or method used to transmit the response. This crop circle and the one that appeared a year prior, featuring a humanoid face, caused a significant amount of intrigue, as it would have taken a significant amount of effort and technological know-how to create such complex designs in a field overnight.\nThird Crop Circle # The third crop circle, which appeared near the Chilbolton radio telescope in 2002, was even more intricate. The image depicted a large disc shape, which some interpreted as a close match to the transmission device shown in the previous year\u0026rsquo;s crop circle. It was speculated to represent the extraterrestrial equivalent of the Arecibo radio telescope.\nSee also # Resources ‚Ä∫ Temporary Temples Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ufology External links # Crop circle | Wikipedia "},{"id":"131","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80/","title":"–õ—é—Ü–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä","description":"–õ—é—Ü–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä (–ª–∞—Ç. –ù–µ—Å—É—â–∏–π –°–≤–µ—Ç –∏–ª–∏ h√™lƒìl, –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç: ◊î÷µ◊ô◊ú÷µ◊ú, —á—Ç–æ –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç —Ç–æ –∂–µ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ), –Ω–µ –ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Å –°–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–π, —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∞ (◊ê÷±◊ú◊ï÷π◊î÷∑÷º) –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞ (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù), –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞—é—â—É—é —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ. –≠—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –∏–º—è —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, –∞ –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω, –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—â–∏–π —Ä–æ–ª—å –Ω–µ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç. –ò–º—è –õ—é—Ü–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å–µ–º–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≥ h√™lƒìl –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—Ç—Å—è –∫ —É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–µ –í–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —Å–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ–º –Ω–∞ –≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥–µ.","content":"Lucifer is a name that is often associated with the Devil or Satan, although its original meaning and interpretation have changed over time. The name Lucifer comes from the Latin word \u0026ldquo;Lucifer,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;light-bringer.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the Bible, the name Lucifer is first mentioned in the book of Isaiah, where it is used to describe the King of Babylon as a fallen angel who was once a bright star but was cast down to hell because of his pride and sin. Lucifer believed by many Christians to have been a powerful angel who rebelled against the Elohim and was cast out of heaven.\nEtymology # In Latin, the term Lucifer translates to light-bringer or morning star, originating from the Latin words \u0026ldquo;lux\u0026rdquo; meaning light and \u0026ldquo;ferre\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;to bring or carry\u0026rdquo;. The term was originally used to refer to the planet Venus, which is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon and often appears just before dawn.\nThe Hebrew term ◊î÷µ◊ô◊ú÷µ◊ú ◊ë÷∂÷º◊ü-◊©÷∏◊Å◊ó÷∑◊® (H√™l√™l ben ≈†ƒÅ·∏•ar) is found in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Isaiah. It is typically translated as \u0026ldquo;son of the morning\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son of the dawn\u0026rdquo;. Helel means \u0026ldquo;shining one\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bright one\u0026rdquo;, while ben Shachar translates to \u0026ldquo;son of dawn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son of morning light\u0026rdquo;. Much like Lucifer, this name was associated with the planet Venus, due to its brightness and appearance in the early morning sky. These names have often been connected with mythological and religious figures associated with light, pride, or rebellion.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and helped humanity in their early stages of development. The following is said about him:\nThen came Lucifer, which means ‚Äúlight bearer‚Äù. Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth, thus created Man. Lucifer was heading a small group of scientists working in one of the genetic engineering laboratories which studied the behavior of the first synthetic men. Noticing the extraordinary aptitudes exhibited by their creation, Lucifer decided to overrule the order and reveal to these first humans that those whom they had mistaken for ‚ÄúGods‚Äù where in fact men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material. Lucifer, and the Elohim who followed him, felt love and affection for their synthetically created humans. They started to love these beings as their own children - these beings that they studied all day long, who were obliged to look upon them as ‚ÄúGods‚Äù.\nLucifer, ‚Äúthe bearer of light‚Äù, enlightened the first men when he revealed that the creators were not ‚ÄúGods‚Äù but men like themselves. This attitude is directly opposed to that of Satan who thinks that only evil can be expected from men, and also to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim‚Äôs planet.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the ‚Äúserpent‚Äù to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the ‚ÄúGarden of Eden‚Äù where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.\nThe passage describes the story of Lucifer, one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and Man, and his decision to reveal to the first humans that their creators were not gods but flesh-and-blood men from another planet who came in flying machines. This act of enlightenment is said to be in opposition to Satan, who believes only evil can come from men, and to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet. As a result of their disobedience, Yahweh condemns the scientists to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth, and evicts Man from the \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo; laboratory where they were taken care of without effort.\nBut when Lucifer‚Äôs group learns that their fabulous creation is soon to be destroyed, they decide that they cannot allow that. They still feel very strongly that among men there are some who are positive and non- violent, full of love and fraternity. Among these was Noah whom they helped build a space craft which would protect him from destruction, by staying in orbit around the earth. This craft contained a few men and women and the genetic codes of some animal species, which would be used to re-create them after the cataclysm. It was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer‚Äôs group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the ‚Äúark‚Äù.\nSatan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will ‚Äúself-destroy‚Äù when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.\nIn this passage, it is explained that Lucifer and his group, who were scientists that created the first humans, reveal to these humans that the creators were not gods, but rather flesh and blood beings from another planet who came in flying machines. Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group feels affection for their creations and decides to protect them from the destruction of the impending cataclysm by helping Noah build a space craft containing humans, animals, and genetic codes to recreate life after the cataclysm. The Elohim, who created humanity, realize that they too were created in the same manner and decide to never again destroy humanity. Meanwhile, Satan believes that humans are inherently evil, but Yahweh and the majority of the council of the Eternals believe otherwise, and they understand that if humans are violent, they will self-destruct when they reach an interplanetary level of civilization.\nAccording to the excerpts, Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth and who headed a group of scientists that studied the behavior of the first synthetic humans. He felt love and affection for these humans, and decided to reveal to them that their creators were men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material.\nLucifer\u0026rsquo;s role, according to the excerpts, was to bring light and knowledge to the first humans, and to teach them about the true nature of their creators. His actions were opposed by Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s planet, who condemned Lucifer and his group to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. However, despite this punishment, Lucifer and his group continued to care for and protect humanity, including helping Noah and his family to escape the cataclysmic flood by building a space craft to protect them.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Satan Wiki ‚Ä∫ Yahweh Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ra√´lism Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Cancer External links # Lucifer | Wikipedia Lucifer | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"132","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0/","title":"–ú–µ–Ω–æ—Ä–∞","description":"–ú–µ–Ω–æ—Ä–∞ —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç –Ω–∞–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —â–∏—Ç–µ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –±–∞–∑—ã –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–º –õ–µ–≤–∞–Ω—Ç–µ. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —â–∏—Ç –∏–º–µ–ª —Å–µ–º—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª—é—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Å –ø–æ–¥—Å–≤–µ—Ç–∫–æ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ, –∫–∞–∫ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Å–≤—è–∑—å —Å —à–µ—Å—Ç—å—é –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ –±–∞–∑–∞–º–∏ –∏ –º–µ–∂–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª–µ–º –Ω–∞ –æ—Ä–±–∏—Ç–µ. –≠—Ç–∞ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ —Å–µ–º—å –≤–µ—Ç–≤–µ–π –ú–µ–Ω–æ—Ä—ã –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—Ç —Å–µ–º—å —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –±–∞–∑, –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ –≤ —Ç—É —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É.","content":"The Menorah has long been a central symbol in Jewish tradition, representing enlightenment, wisdom, and divine inspiration. Its seven branches are often interpreted symbolically, with various interpretations existing within different Jewish traditions.\nEtymology # The word Menorah is of Hebrew origin, deriving from the word ◊û÷∞◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊î (m\u0026rsquo;nor√°), pronounced \u0026lsquo;men¬∑≈ç¬∑r√§\u0026rsquo;. The term literally translates to lampstand in English. It is a compound of two root words: me\u0026rsquo;ir, meaning shining or giving light, and nor, meaning lamp or light. Hence, the Menorah symbolically represents a source of light. This is fitting given its historical use as a seven-branched lampstand, designed to hold seven lamps, in the temple of Jerusalem.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the first book of the Ra√´lian canon, \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh elaborates on the symbolism of the Israelite seven-branched candlestick:\nThe traces of the creators‚Äô bases on high mountains is mentioned in the Book of Amos:\nHe that\u0026hellip; treadeth upon the high places of the earth. Amos 4: 13.\nThe creators had seven bases in all: Those seven;\nthey are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth. Zechariah 4: 10.\nThis is the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, the meaning of which has been lost. In the beginning at the creators‚Äô headquarters, there was a switchboard with seven lighted switches enabling them to stay in contact with the other bases and with the interplanetary vessel orbiting the Earth.\nThe Elohim established bases on Earth, particularly in elevated areas. It cites the Book of Amos from the Bible to substantiate this assertion, specifically Amos 4:13, which refers to a being treading \u0026ldquo;upon the high places of the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to this narrative, the Elohim maintained seven such bases around the planet. This is referenced through an interpretation of Zechariah 4:10, where \u0026ldquo;those seven; they are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth\u0026rdquo; is interpreted to represent the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s bases. These seven sites provided the Elohim with a global overview, thereby acting as the metaphorical \u0026ldquo;eyes\u0026rdquo; through which they could monitor and manage their creation.\nThe text further proposes that these seven bases are the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, a symbol prominent in Jewish tradition, also known as the Menorah. The original significance of the symbol may have been forgotten over time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s postulated that at the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s central base, a switchboard featuring seven lighted switches existed. These switches were alleged to maintain communication links with the other six bases and an orbiting interplanetary vessel, creating a network of strategic locations from which the Elohim could supervise their creation and conduct their operations on Earth.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Star of David Wiki ‚Ä∫ Swastika Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aries External links # Temple menorah | Wikipedia Candlestick | Jewish Encyclopedia Menorah | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"133","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE/","title":"–ú–µ—Ç–æ–¥ –ë–∏–≥–ª–∏–Ω–æ","description":"–ú–µ—Ç–æ–¥ –ë–∏–≥–ª–∏–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π –∞–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥ –∫ —Ç–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏, –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞—é—â–∏–π –∑–∞ –±—É–∫–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ –µ–µ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è, –∞ –Ω–µ –∑–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–π —è–∑—ã–∫ –∏–ª–∏ —É—Å—Ç–æ—è–≤—à—É—é—Å—è —ç–∫–∑–µ–≥–µ–∑—É. –û–Ω —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∏—Ç—Å—è —Ä–∞—Å–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ä—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤, –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—è —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç –±–µ–∑ –º–µ—Ç–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–π –∏ –ø–æ–¥—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏–≤–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç.","content":"Parallels with Schliemann # Heinrich Schliemann was a 19th-century German archaeologist and businessman. He is best known for his excavations at the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae, where he claimed to have discovered the remnants of the historical cities mentioned in Greek mythology. Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s excavations and his belief in the historical accuracy of the Iliad and the Odyssey brought him both fame and controversy. Despite criticisms of his methods, Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s discoveries significantly contributed to the field of archaeology and our understanding of ancient civilizations.\nIn the book Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth by Jean Sendy, a parallel is drawn between Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s literal approach to reading the Homeric verses and his successful uncovering of the alleged ruins of Troy.\nThe hypothesis that forms the structure of this book is founded on portions of the Bible, read as Schliemann read Homer.1\nSendy contends that just as Schliemann approached the Iliad with meticulousness and attentiveness, he advocates for a similar level of rigor in interpreting the Bible. By employing a comparable methodology, Sendy suggests that a literal reading of the biblical text can yield valuable insights and discoveries. The maxim that Sendy puts forward is the \u0026ldquo;reading the Bible as Schliemann read Homer\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat Schliemann did for Homer was exactly what I have tried to do for the Biblical narrative that concerns me.\nReading the Bible as Schliemann read Homer means ignoring all the exegeses that have accumulated around it for the past two thousand years. Their avowed purpose is to seek proof of the existence of God in the Bible. To someone who reads the Bible \u0026ldquo;√† la Schliemann,\u0026rdquo; on the assumption that the text is to be taken. in its most concrete sense God is as far outside the subject as the religtous beliefs of the Greeks and Trojans were to Schliemann.2\nSendy asserts that, just as Schliemann approached the works of Homer with a keen eye for the concrete and tangible aspects of the text, he himself has endeavored to adopt a similar approach in interpreting the Bible. This approach entails disregarding the accumulated exegeses and interpretations that have developed over the course of two millennia, particularly those aimed at finding proof of the existence of God within the text. By reading the Bible with a Schliemann-like mindset, one is encouraged to focus on the narrative\u0026rsquo;s most concrete sense, setting aside theological assumptions and religious beliefs. This contextualization highlights the success of Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s approach in archaeology, as he uncovered physical evidence that aligned with the mythical cities of Troy and Mycenae, which were believed to be mere legends until his discoveries. Similarly, the author implies that a similar concrete reading of the biblical narrative, unencumbered by theological preconceptions, can lead to fresh insights and a deeper understanding of the text\u0026rsquo;s original, intended meaning.\nIn a manner akin to paradigm shifts in scientific research, Mauro Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach to interpreting ancient texts parallels the transformative impact of figures like Schliemann in their respective fields. This can be likened to Galileo\u0026rsquo;s groundbreaking assertion during the Copernican Revolution, where he challenged the prevailing belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth. As with any significant breakthrough, initial reactions typically involve disbelief, staunch denial, and even ridicule. Yet, the discoverer eventually presents evidence, akin to a telescope, urging skeptics to examine the truth for themselves:\nIt always happens, it is just a matter of time. One day someone just comes along and tells you that it is not true that the Sun revolves around the Earth, that exactly the opposite is true. We can imagine the faces of the bystanders.\nAt which point the discoverer shows them a telescope and invites them to have a look for themselves. The first reaction is always the same: disbelief, harsh denial, mockery. Come on, how is that possible? Let‚Äôs be serious, no one wants to fool around here, especially not about certain things.3\nInvariably, the response follows a familiar pattern: skepticism gives way to recognition, denial yields to acceptance, and mockery transforms into serious consideration. Such is the nature of transformative discoveries that challenge established paradigms, and it is within this context that Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach aligns with the spirit of unveiling unconventional interpretations of ancient texts.\nGalileo, after all, can remind us of Ulysses. The adventure of the Homeric hero seems to be speaking directly to us even to this day. Running into unexplored territories requires a willingness to let the known islands slip out of sight, to let go of conventionally acquired knowledge.\nAnd speaking of Homer: if, for the sake of argument, your name is Heinrich Schliemann and, perchance, one day you find yourself in love with the Iliad, what could you possibly guess from that?\nThe road is certainly all uphill from there. If you believe that simple literary pages, however venerated as masterpieces, could unveil chapters of real history, the path ahead of you will be impenetrable.4\nSchliemann\u0026rsquo;s approach provides a compelling example of how a literal reading of mythological history can lead to significant breakthroughs. Inspired by his fascination with the Iliad, Schliemann embarked on a remarkable endeavor guided by the belief that the ancient literary work held kernels of historical truth. Despite the challenges and skepticism he faced, Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s unwavering conviction in the historicity of the text drove him to excavate the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae. Astonishingly, his meticulous efforts unearthed physical evidence that aligned with the mythological narratives, validating his interpretation and reshaping scholarly understanding. Schliemann\u0026rsquo;s success demonstrates the potential of adopting a literal reading approach to uncover new insights and challenge prevailing assumptions within the realm of mythological accounts.\nThe Naked Bible # The Naked Bible is a book written by the Italian journalist, playwright and screenwriter Giorgio Cattaneo and the Italian scholar Mauro Biglino, which challenges the traditional understanding of the Bible. In their book, Cattaneo writes about how Biglino argues that the texts of the Old Testament, specifically the Torah, were not divinely inspired, but rather were written by ancient scribes who recorded the history and beliefs of their society. Therein, Biglino claims that the text has been mistranslated and misinterpreted over time, and that a more accurate understanding of the Bible would reveal that it is not a divine text, but rather a historical document that reflects the cultural and political context of its authors.\nIn this book, on page 119, a method is described that outlines Biglino\u0026rsquo;s approach to examining ancient scriptures and uncovering their intended meaning. The method, developed through years of scholarly work, offers a fresh perspective on interpreting the Bible by taking its content literally rather than relying on figurative language or established exegesis.\nThe Biglino method works like this: ‚Äòpretend‚Äô that the Bible is simply telling the truth.\nThis means that the Bible, when read literally, suddenly becomes more consistent and appears to tell a fundamentally different story than commonly suggested by established Christian institutions such as the Catholic Church. By immersing himself in the original Hebrew texts and meticulously exploring the etymology of each word, Biglino contends that the Bible should be treated as a historical document reflecting the cultural and political context of its authors, rather than a divinely inspired text. The method encourages readers to consider what the Bible actually describes in its original form, acknowledging the uncertainties resulting from the transmission and alteration of ancient texts over time.\nTo let The Naked Bible talk for itself, on page 416, the following is stated about the method:\nWhat does the text actually describe in the original Hebrew?\nA completely different story.\nBiglino opened that box. And he has never closed it. ‚ÄúThis type of project, which I worked on for a few years, brought me into direct contact, let‚Äôs say, with the very origins, with the etymology of each individual word. Terms that, time after time, are put back into the context of the stories. Words that gave birth to a mosaic that is totally different from what is traditionally told to us.‚Äù\nHe started doing this in 2010. Then he began to publish everything he thought he was really reading in the Masoretic Hebrew codex.\n‚ÄúAnd so I poured out my doubts, my perplexities, my questions on paper. I expressed my feelings, in describing what was coming out of it. And always with a precise method: ‚Äòlet‚Äôs pretend that it‚Äôs true.‚Äô‚Äù\nThe book is written in a way where Cattaneo explores the scholarly work of Biglino by quoting and contextualizing a series of Biglino statements. These statements are decorated with appropriate quotation marks in the various passages highlighted here. Biglino says that the main method of his scholarly work consists of \u0026ldquo;pretending\u0026rdquo; what the Bible says \u0026ldquo;is true\u0026rdquo;. The passage goes on to say:\nIn other words, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pretend‚Äù that what is written in the Bible is true.\nSo‚Ä¶ is it true?\n‚ÄúWho knows? No one can guarantee it.‚Äù\nSo, let‚Äôs pretend that it is.\n‚ÄúTo be clear, it is not a playful method. In my opinion, though, it is the only proper one, precisely because we cannot be sure that what is written in the Bible is true. We do not possess the original codices. We only have copies of copies of copies, continually re-worked over time.‚Äù\nThis is confirmed by the biblical scholars of the Jewish universities themselves, such as those in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\n‚ÄúIf there is one thing we can be sure of, it‚Äôs that the texts we have today are not the ones that were originally compiled, because every time they re-wrote them, they changed them.‚Äù\nAnd this is certainly not just a biblical anomaly or exclusive to the Old Testament.\n‚ÄúNaturally, this applies to all ancient texts, not just the Bible. So where‚Äôs the problem? The Bible is the only one on which a system of religious thought has been built, thought that claims to be the bearer of absolute, unquestionable truths.‚Äù\nThis is the real anomaly, and this really is exclusive.\n‚ÄúIf we accept the Bible for what it is and treat it accordingly, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, there‚Äôs no problem. If, however, we want to mine out absolute truths, then I say that we should at least go and see what the text says. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs pretend‚Äô that what is written is true. And let‚Äôs see what comes of that.‚Äù\nThis is the fruit of the Biglino method, the result of long and patient work, offered to the readers.\n‚ÄúBasically I say, ‚ÄòThis text, later interpreted for other purposes by various theologies of different origins, must in fact be separated from those intentions and be simply read again, just like all other ancient sources.‚Äô‚Äù\nThe problem?\n‚ÄúIt arises when we want to consider the text as unique in the history of humanity because it was ‚Äòinspired by God.‚Äô And unfortunately (I say ‚Äòunfortunately‚Äô for those who believe) the Bible simply isn‚Äôt.‚Äù\nThe method involves pretending that the Bible is true and examining the original Hebrew text to understand its actual description. However, it is acknowledged that no one can guarantee the truthfulness of the Bible, as we only have copies of copies of the original codices, which have been reworked over time. This approach is not considered playful but rather the only appropriate one given the uncertainty surrounding the Bible\u0026rsquo;s accuracy. It is noted that the texts we have today are not the original ones, as they have been changed with each rewriting.\nThis phenomenon is not exclusive to the Bible but applies to all ancient texts. The anomaly lies in the fact that the Bible has been the basis for a religious system claiming to possess absolute truths. Ultimately, the Biglino method suggests treating the Bible as an ancient source separate from theological intentions and reading it like any other ancient text.\nThe method # In The Naked Bible, on page 408, we find two-step procedure that sums up the exegetical prowess of the method proposed by Biglino:\nFirst, forget, for a moment, about all traditional interpretations.\nSecond, focus on a literal reading, pure and simple, of those verses.\nThe result is often astounding. And there is no need of any magic carpets to imagine who knows what. The Old Testament speaks for itself, explicitly and transparently.\nSo, the Biglino method consists of these two steps, to set aside all traditional interpretations and to embrace a literal reading of the verses.\nIn the realm of Biglino\u0026rsquo;s translation work, an additional prerequisite, a third step, emerges, which involves reading the verses in their original language. If that proves unattainable, the recommended course is to refrain from translating ambiguous terms altogether. Biglino emphasizes this aspect on page 87, expressing his belief that certain terms should remain unaltered in order to maintain integrity, as their precise meanings remain elusive:\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve said many times in recent years that there are terms that, in my opinion, should not be translated. It‚Äôs a question of integrity, since we do not know exactly what they mean. So honesty requires leaving them just as they are written.‚Äù5\nHonesty, he asserts, necessitates preserving them in their original form. With that in mind, Biglino\u0026rsquo;s method can be distilled into a concise formulation consisting of three steps:\nObtain familiarity with the original text Disregard all preconceived traditional interpretations Embrace a literal approach to reading the verses The Biglino method, originally put forward in The Naked Bible as a two-tiered methodology and subsequently expanded with an additional assumption in here, suggests a three-step approach to interpreting the Bible: familiarize oneself with the original text, set aside preconceived traditional interpretations, and embrace a literal reading of the verses. By following these steps, the method aims to uncover new insights and challenge established understandings of the biblical text.\nStep 1: Obtain familiarity with the original text # The first step of the Biglino Method involves obtaining familiarity with the original text of the Bible. This entails engaging with the scriptures in their original languages, primarily Hebrew and Greek, in which the Old and New Testaments were respectively written. By studying the original text, one aims to gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic nuances, cultural context, and literary style employed by the ancient authors.\nWhile obtaining fluency in biblical languages may not be feasible for everyone, resources such as interlinear translations, lexicons, and commentaries can aid in developing a deeper familiarity with the original text.\nStep 2: Disregard all preconceived traditional interpretations # The second step of the Biglino Method calls for disregarding all preconceived traditional interpretations of the Bible. This involves approaching the text with a fresh perspective, free from the influence of established doctrines, religious dogmas, and inherited interpretations that may have shaped one\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the scriptures.\nBy setting aside preconceived notions, readers are encouraged to engage directly with the biblical text, allowing it to speak for itself without the filter of traditional interpretations. It enables readers to question long-held assumptions, explore different angles of interpretation, and consider alternative viewpoints that may challenge or expand their understanding of the biblical narratives.\nStep 3: Embrace a literal approach to reading the verses # The third step of the Biglino Method advocates for embracing a literal approach to reading the verses of the Bible. This step involves taking the words and phrases in the text at face value, without imposing metaphorical or allegorical interpretations upon them.\nBy adopting a literal approach, readers are encouraged to understand the words in their most straightforward and direct sense, considering them in their ordinary meaning within the given context. Rather than searching for hidden or symbolic meanings, the focus is on grasping the explicit message conveyed by the biblical authors.\nEmbracing a literal approach does not discount the presence of literary devices, poetic expressions, or the use of metaphors within the Bible. However, it calls for discerning between figurative language intended to convey a specific message and passages that are intended to be understood more literally.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino has consistently employed this method since his initial translation work of Biblical scripture from Hebrew into Italian.\nJust to be safe, Biglino declares that he adheres to a precise method. ‚ÄúI simply pretend that the Bible tells the truth, and when I verify that this truth is coherent.‚Äù\nEmphasizing his commitment to a rigorous approach, Biglino asserts that he adopts the stance of assuming the truthfulness of the Bible, subsequently verifying the coherence of this truth during his analysis.\nAnd is it?\n‚ÄúVery often, yes, it absolutely is. Everything can be explained in the simplest of ways. It‚Äôs just a matter of asking the right questions and the Bible will always offer a reasonable answer that makes sense.‚Äù\nAccording to him, the Bible often presents itself as a reliable source of information that can be explained in straightforward terms. By approaching the text with a critical mindset and posing pertinent questions, Biglino believes that the Bible consistently provides reasonable and sensible answers. This viewpoint suggests that a careful examination of the scriptures can unveil a coherent narrative that aligns with common sense and logical reasoning.\nMauro Biglino praises the exegetical and philological accuracy of Edizioni San Paolo: ‚ÄúRegarding the volumes we worked on together, while I was doing my editorial work for them, the term ‚ÄòElohim‚Äô was left that way in Italian as well. They did not translate it as the word ‚ÄòGod‚Äô.‚Äù\nMauro Biglino acknowledges the significant contribution of Edizioni San Paolo in maintaining exegetical and philological accuracy in their translation work. Notably, during their collaboration, the term \u0026ldquo;Elohim\u0026rdquo; was preserved in Italian without being translated as the word \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo; This decision reflects a commitment to retaining the original term, thereby preserving the linguistic nuances and cultural context associated with it.\nThe same thing goes for the word ‚ÄòYahweh‚Äô. ‚ÄúThat one also always remained ‚ÄòYahweh‚Äô and was not translated as ‚Äòthe Lord‚Äô as is the case with ordinary editions of the Bible ‚Äì even though translating Yahweh as ‚Äòthe Lord‚Äô is a complete fabrication.‚Äù\nAccording to Biglino, the translation of the word \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;the Lord\u0026rdquo; in ordinary editions of the Bible is considered by him to be a complete fabrication. He asserts that the term \u0026ldquo;Yahweh\u0026rdquo; should not be translated, but rather preserved as is, without imposing an alternate designation such as \u0026ldquo;the Lord.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to Jean Sendy # Within the pages of the book \u0026ldquo;Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth,\u0026rdquo; a profound observation is made by Sendy, shedding light on the transformative nature of a literal reading of the Bible. Sendy highlights a significant linguistic aspect by pointing out that the Hebrew word Elohim, typically translated as \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; is actually in plural form.\nWhen we read the Bible in that way, we must first note that the Hebrew word Elohim, usually translated as \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; is a plural. If we read \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Celestials,\u0026rdquo; each time the plural Elohim occurs we find ourselves reading a narrative that needs no exegesis, no helpful prodding, no religious conviction, in order to be thoroughly coherent.\nThis linguistic nuance, when taken into account, leads to a striking reinterpretation. By reading \u0026ldquo;Those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Celestials\u0026rdquo; instead of the singular \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; each time the plural Elohim occurs, the narrative unfolds with remarkable coherence, eliminating the need for extensive exegesis, external guidance, or preconceived religious convictions.\nRead in this way, Genesis appears as an account of the arrival of perfectly concrete Celestials, physically in our image, who behaved on earth as we can imagine our own astronauts behaving on another planet in a future that is still far off but no longer belongs to the realm of science fiction.\nBy adopting a literal reading, one can perceive Genesis as a fascinating narrative recounting the arrival of tangible celestial beings who bear a striking resemblance to humans. These celestial beings are depicted as engaging with the earthly realm in a manner akin to how we envision future astronauts exploring distant planets.\nThis interpretation, in line with the Biglino Method, invites readers to consider the concrete and tangible aspects of the biblical account, imagining a scenario that lies beyond the realm of science fiction but resonates with a potential reality. Such an approach challenges traditional allegorical or metaphorical interpretations of Genesis, offering an alternative perspective that is firmly grounded in the text\u0026rsquo;s literal content.\nOur take # The Biglino method, advocating a literal approach to reading the Bible and ancient scriptures, is instrumental in distilling their original intended meaning. By taking the text at face value, free from symbolic or metaphorical interpretations imposed by traditional exegesis, readers gain a clearer understanding of the straightforward message conveyed by the ancient authors.\nWhile the literal approach is paramount for grasping the plain meaning of the text, it is important to recognize that the ancient scribes occasionally employed subtle linguistic devices and cultural references. In such cases, a nuanced reading is required to uncover the intended significance behind the words. This nuanced understanding, however, does not rely on imposing symbolic interpretations but rather relies on contextual analysis and familiarity with the historical and cultural context of the scriptures.\nThe Biglino method encourages a balanced approach, combining a literal reading with contextual awareness, to unravel the true intentions of the scribes. By adhering to the literal words while considering the broader historical and cultural backdrop, readers can appreciate the original intended meaning without distorting the text with extraneous symbolic interpretations.\nIn conclusion, the Biglino method\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on a literal approach enables a more accurate understanding of the Bible and ancient scriptures, while acknowledging the occasional need for contextual analysis to capture the nuances and intended significance of the text. This approach offers readers an opportunity to engage directly with the scriptures and uncover their intended message without relying on traditional exegesis and its symbolic interpretations.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Neo-Euhemerism Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sendy\u0026#39;s conditions of coherence Read more # Resources ‚Ä∫ The Naked Bible Excerpt from Jean Sendy (1972): Those Gods Who Made Heaven And Earth, p. 12\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 12\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Mauro Biglino, Giorgio Cattaneo (2022): The Naked Bible: The truth about the most famous book in history, p. 6\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 7\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn the book, Biglino explains that it was of utmost importance during his translation work of the Edizioni San Paolo to preserve the original spellings of ambigous terms like Kavod, Ruach, Elohim or even Yahweh.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":"134","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0/","title":"–ú–∏—Ñ–µ–º–∞","description":"–ú–∏—Ñ–µ–º–∞, —Ñ—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –º–∏—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ä—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã.","content":"A mytheme is a basic unit or component of a myth, folklore, or religious tradition. It refers to a recurring motif, symbol, story, or character that appears in multiple myths and legends across cultures and time periods. Mythemes often serve as building blocks for larger myths and stories and can convey important cultural values, beliefs, or moral lessons. In comparative mythology, the study of mythemes helps scholars identify common themes, symbols, and motifs across cultures and understand how they are transformed and evolve over time. The concept of mytheme was first introduced by French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss and has since become an important tool in the study of comparative mythology and folklore.\nWhile there are hundreds of catalogized mythemes, here are a few examples of famous mythemes:\nThe Flood Myth: A story of a great flood that destroys the world and is often seen as a symbol of rebirth and renewal. This myth is found in many cultures, including the ancient Babylonian myth of the epic of Gilgamesh, the biblical story of Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, and the Hindu myth of Manu.\nThe Hero\u0026rsquo;s Journey: A narrative pattern in which a hero embarks on a quest, faces challenges, and ultimately returns home transformed. This mytheme is found in the mythologies of many cultures, including the Greek myth of Odysseus and the Hindu myth of Rama.\nThe Trickster: A figure, often represented by a god, animal, or other supernatural being, who is known for playing tricks, breaking rules, and testing the limits of society. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the African American folktales of Br\u0026rsquo;er Rabbit, the Norse myth of Loki, and the Native American myth of Coyote.\nThe Divine Twins: A pair of gods or demigods who are often depicted as inseparable and are associated with complementary aspects of life, such as light and darkness, good and evil, or birth and death. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus, the Greek myth of Castor and Pollux, and the Hindu myth of Ashvins.\nThe Creation Myth: A story that explains the origins of the world and its inhabitants. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the biblical story of Genesis, the ancient Egyptian myth of Atum, and the Hindu myth of Brahma.\nThe Apocalypse Myth: A story of the end of the world and the events leading up to it. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the biblical book of Revelation, the Norse myth of Ragnarok, and the Hindu myth of Kali Yuga.\nThe Quest for Immortality: A story in which a hero embarks on a journey to find a way to achieve immortality or escape death. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Greek myth of the Golden Fleece, the Chinese myth of Xian, and the African myth of Anansi.\nThe Abandoned Child: A story in which a child is abandoned by its parents and must overcome obstacles to find its place in the world. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus, the biblical story of Moses, and the Native American myth of the Orphan Boy.\nThe Underworld Journey: A story in which a hero travels to the underworld to rescue a loved one, retrieve a lost object, or gain knowledge. This mytheme is found in many cultures, including the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Mayan myth of Xibalba, and the African myth of Anansi.\nThese are just a few examples of famous mythemes found in mythology and folklore around the world.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Comparative mythology Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of mythemes and mythological motifs External links # Mytheme | Wikipedia "},{"id":"135","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–ú–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –±–æ–≥–æ–≤","description":"–ú–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –±–æ–≥–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—É—é –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—é –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏, —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–π –æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤. –≠—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ü–∏—è —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤–µ—Ä—É –≤ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–∏ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞-—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Ö–æ–∂–∏ –Ω–∞ –ª—é–¥–µ–π, –∏, —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –ª—é–¥–∏ –æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª–æ–º —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤ –±–æ–≥–æ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –≤ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–º.","content":"In common terms, the Plurality of Gods refers to a belief system or theological concept that upholds the existence of more than one god or deity. This stands in contrast to monotheism, which asserts the existence of a single supreme deity.\nOne of the primary examples of belief systems involving a plurality of gods is polytheism. Polytheism is a belief in many gods who are often organized in a complex social order. These gods may form something akin to a divine family, and each one has specific functions, attributes, or domains over which they hold control. Ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Norse religions are prime examples of polytheistic belief systems.\nAnother form is henotheism, where there is the belief in and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities. Hinduism has elements of this belief system, where devotees may focus their worship on a specific deity like Shiva or Vishnu, while acknowledging the existence of other gods and goddesses.\nIn Mormonism # The notion of Plurality of Gods is very specifc in Mormonism. In the context of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often known as the LDS Church or the Mormon Church or simply as Mormonism), the concept of a plurality of gods is distinct from the polytheistic and henotheistic traditions in other religions. Mormon theology teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, which make up the Godhead.\nThe Mormon Church also holds a belief in the potential for human beings to achieve a form of divinity, often referred to as \u0026ldquo;exaltation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;eternal progression.\u0026rdquo; This doctrine is based on several biblical and Book of Mormon verses that talk about humans becoming joint-heirs with Christ, as well as later teachings by church leaders, most notably Lorenzo Snow\u0026rsquo;s couplet: \u0026ldquo;As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be.\u0026rdquo;\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Cosmic pluralism Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Neo-euhemerism External links # God in Mormonism # Plurality of Gods | Wikipedia The Plurality of Gods | MormonWiki "},{"id":"136","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9/","title":"–ú–æ–∏—Å–µ–π","description":"–ú–æ–∏—Å–µ–π, –±–∏–±–ª–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—Ö –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω –ò—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∞.","content":"Moses was a prophet, lawgiver, and leader in the Abrahamic religion of Judaism. According to the biblical account, Moses was born in Egypt to Jewish parents and was rescued as a baby and raised by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter. As an adult, he received a divine call from God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Ten Commandments and other laws on Mount Sinai. Moses is considered one of the greatest prophets in Judaism, and his story is an important part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the Islamic Qur\u0026rsquo;an.\nAccording to the biblical account, Moses was born in Egypt to Jewish parents during a time of enslavement and oppression. As a young man, he killed an Egyptian taskmaster who was mistreating a Hebrew slave and fled to Midian. There, he married the daughter of a priest and became a shepherd.\nYears later, God appeared to Moses in a burning bush and called him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses was initially hesitant, but with God\u0026rsquo;s help he performed several miracles, including turning his staff into a serpent, to convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites. After a series of plagues and the final plague of the death of the firstborn, Pharaoh agreed to let the Israelites go. Moses then led the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, where they were pursued by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s army. God miraculously split the sea, allowing the Israelites to cross safely and drowning the Egyptians.\nMoses then led the Israelites to Mount Sinai, where he received the Ten Commandments and other laws from God. Moses also played a key role in establishing the tabernacle, a portable temple for the worship of God, and organized the Israelites into a community governed by the laws and practices he received from God.\nAfter 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, Moses died at the age of 120 and was buried by God in an unknown location. Despite his death, Moses remains a revered figure in the history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and is considered one of the greatest leaders and prophets in the Abrahamic tradition.\nMoshe # The origin of the name Moses is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, his name is given as \u0026ldquo;Moshe\u0026rdquo; (◊û÷π◊©÷∂◊Å◊î) and is derived from the Egyptian word \u0026ldquo;mose\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;son.\u0026rdquo; Some scholars believe that the name may have been given to him by Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter, who rescued him as a baby, while others believe that it may have been a name commonly given to boys in ancient Egypt.\nIn the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, Moses\u0026rsquo; name is given as \u0026ldquo;Mouses\u0026rdquo; (ŒúœâœÖœÉ·øÜœÇ), which is the source of the English name \u0026ldquo;Moses.\u0026rdquo; Other versions of the name in different languages include Mo√Øse in French, Mos√® in Italian, and Mois√©s in Spanish. Regardless of its origin, the name Moses has become synonymous with the prophet, lawgiver, and leader who is revered as one of the greatest figures in the history of Judaism and a central figure in the Abrahamic tradition.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the third Chapter of The Book Which Tells The Truthüìñ, Watching Over the Chosen People, Yahweh contextualized the need for a new prophet:\nBecause of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:\nPut away the foreign gods that are among you.\n‚Äî Genesis 35: 2.\nIn Exodus, we appeared to Moses.\nAnd the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush.\n‚Äî Exodus 3: 2.\nA rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.\nThe people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.\nThe successors of the once advanced civilization had become slaves to neighboring tribes after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and that it was necessary to restore their dignity by returning their land to them. The people there had regressed to a primitive state, worshipping idols instead of acknowledging the true creators, the Elohim. In Exodus, Moses encountered an extraterrestrial being, Yahweh, who appeared to him in a flame of fire. The text suggests that this was a result of a rocket landing in front of him, which he interpreted in a way that corresponds to the experiences of a person from a primitive culture encountering a flying vessel.\nFurther on, Yahweh explains the following:\nThen in Chapter 20 of Exodus a certain number of rules are cited. Because the Israelites were so primitive, they needed laws regarding morals and especially hygiene. These were outlined in the commandments. The creators came to dictate these laws to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they arrived in a flying vessel:\nAnd it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled\u0026hellip; And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. Moses spake, and Elohim answered him by a voice.\n‚Äî Exodus 19: 16-19.\nThe creators were afraid of being invaded or maltreated by human beings. It was therefore essential that they be respected, even venerated, so that they would be in no danger:\nThe people cannot come up to mount Sinai\u0026hellip; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Yahweh, lest he break forth upon them.\n‚Äî Exodus 19: 23-24.\nIt explains how the Elohim, the creators dictated a set of rules and commandments to Moses in order to guide the primitive Israelites in matters of morals and hygiene. The text also describes how the creators arrived on Mount Sinai in a flying vessel, which caused thunder and lightening and a great commotion among the people. The creators were fearful of being invaded or mistreated by the humans, so it was essential that they be respected and venerated. The people were not allowed to approach Mount Sinai or come up to Yahweh, as this could be dangerous.\nIn summary, Moses was a prophet who received guidance and assistance from extraterrestrial beings, referred to as the creators. The creators helped Moses liberate the people of Israel from slavery, guided them through the desert, and provided them with food and water. They also provided the Israelites with laws and regulations, including the Ten Commandments, which were intended to guide their morality and hygiene. Additionally, the creators requested offerings and a residence built for them according to their own plans. Finally, the creators assisted the Israelites in conquering the Promised Land and provided them with medical knowledge, including how to treat snakebites.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Prophet Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aries External links # Moses | Wikipedia Moses | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"137","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE-%D1%8D%D0%B2%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC/","title":"–ù–µ–æ-—ç–≤—Ö–µ–º–µ—Ä–∏–∑–º","description":"–ù–µ–æ—ç–≤–≥–µ–º–µ—Ä–∏–∑–º - —ç—Ç–æ —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∞ —Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –º–∏—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—é, –≤ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É –±–æ–≥–æ–≤ –∏ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤, –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ö, –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ä—É—è –∫–∞–∂—É—â–∏–µ—Å—è —Å–≤–µ—Ä—Ö—ä–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏, –ø—Ä–∏–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –±–æ–≥–∞–º, –∫–∞–∫ —Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–π —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –ù–µ–æ—ç–≤–≥–µ–º–µ—Ä–∏–∑–º –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫—É—é –ø–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏–≥–º—É, –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏–≤–∞—é—â—É—é –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –±–æ–≥–æ–≤ –∫ –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ, –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –°–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ, –≥–∏–ø–æ—Ç–µ–∑–∞, –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞—è –∑–¥–µ—Å—å, –≤ ¬´–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–µ –Ω–µ–±–µ—Å¬ª, –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –∏–º–µ–µ—Ç —Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—É—é –î–ù–ö —Å –Ω–µ–æ—ç–≤–≥–µ–º–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞–º–∏.","content":"Euhemerism # Euhemerism is a philosophical and literary approach to myths and legends that views them as exaggerated accounts of historical events. The approach is named after Euhemerus, a 4th-century BCE Greek philosopher, who argued that the gods of mythology were originally historical figures who were later deified and worshipped as gods.\nAccording to Euhemeristic theory, myths and legends were created by early societies as a way of explaining natural phenomena and cultural traditions. Over time, these accounts were embellished and transformed into grand tales of gods and heroes, but they retained some connection to the original historical events that inspired them.\nEuhemerism has been influential in the study of religion, mythology, and the history of culture, and has been used as a tool for interpreting the beliefs and practices of ancient societies. Some modern scholars have criticized Euhemerism for oversimplifying the complex interplay between history, culture, and religion, but it remains an important perspective in the study of mythology and ancient beliefs.\nNeo-euhemerism # Neo-Euhemerism is a modern take that builds on the concept of Euhemerism, which suggests that gods and other mythical beings were originally historical figures whose legends and stories became distorted over time. Neo-Euhemerism goes a step further by proposing that ancient gods were actually humanoid aliens. While the original Euhemeristic approach emphasized the historical basis of myth and saw the gods of mythology as originally historical figures who were later deified, neo-Euhemerism expands on this approach and views the deified people as extraterrestrial in origin and were deified because of their scientific and technological leap which looked magical and supernatural in the eyes of earlier human civilizations. It is an idea that suggests that myths and legends may have originated from encounters with extraterrestrial beings.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino writes in his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Idea About The Bible this:\nWe have addressed the issue of the origin of religion as the possible result of historical events, real experiences, and concrete and tangible relationships with some ‚Äúgods‚Äù.\nHe begins the book with the following premise:\nOld Testament writings are generally derived from stories written by other people, such as the ancient Sumerians. These stories have given rise to certain theories, which are summarized here in this first chapter. These theories, ‚Äì we can call them truths - that once confirmed will cause the end of a great illusion: Our current religious thought system based on concepts developed by men. This religious thought system which includes Christianity, is being operated by those who have exploited pretentiously-named ‚Äúsacred texts‚Äù in order to build a structure a power structure of control and manipulation. It is time for that all to end; and it is time for the truth. For instance, we are interested in knowing how, where and when the Bible speaks of Anaq√¨m: Concrete beings that have come to Earth from other worlds. Though the Roman Catholic Church now acknowledges this information, they continue to misleadingly represent the Anaqim as ‚Äúspiritual entities.‚Äù As we analyze the Old Testament, we will identify these concrete beings using their correct Hebrew names (for instance ‚ÄúThose who from heaven to Earth came‚Äù in Hebrew are ‚ÄúAnaqiti‚Äù instead of the more well-known published Sumerian name, ‚ÄúAnunnaki‚Äù).\nThis is a story that can be disconcerting for some, but certainly full of fascination, and one that also brings an overwhelming liberating potential for those who walk a free thinking path. It is a story far removed from dogmas, illusions and forced interpretations of modern Christianity. Modern religions tend to be adapted to a preconceived vision of divinity, that one which immediately identifies the presence of the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù with transcendence. They create an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù world, a divinity far from man in substance and form: undefined, vague and not able to be represented. You will soon find out that the Bible talks of many other ‚Äúgods‚Äù; precisely, the most ancient texts tell the story of these gods in connection with the origin of men and the Jewish people. These texts tell about times when men still walked with gods (namely the Anaq√¨ms/Eloh√¨ms). We find that men used to talk and eat with them, make arrangements with them, and serve them; but also use them and betray them, follow and abandon them, all according to the interests of the moment and the contingent circumstances. This was an historical era when men could choose their ‚Äúgods‚Äù from among the many possibilities, never asking the question of just one god. The divine was perceived in a totally different way from that which was to be eventually built, once men lost this direct contact.\nBiglino argues that the Old Testament writings are largely based on stories from ancient Sumerians and that these stories reveal concrete beings called Anaq√¨m who came to Earth from other worlds. He suggests that modern Christianity and other religions have distorted the true nature of divinity, which is far removed from dogmas and forced interpretations. The Bible talks about many other \u0026ldquo;gods,\u0026rdquo; and in the past, men used to walk and talk with them, make arrangements, serve them, and betray them. The divine was perceived differently in the past than it is today, and this understanding could bring an overwhelming liberating potential for those who walk a free-thinking path. The core tenet of this free-thinking path is neo-euhemeristic in essence as it postualtes as re-interpretation of the divine beings of Biblical scriptures to be actual beings of flesh and blood and the meaning of the writings got distorted over time.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # The concept of Neo-Euhemerism can be seen as a core tenet of the philosophical implications of Ra√´lism, which posits that the Elohim mentioned in various religious texts, including the Bible, were actually extraterrestrial beings who visited Earth in the distant past and were mistaken for gods. Ra√´lism suggests that the true accounts of these extraterrestrial visitors were distorted over time, leading to the creation of various myths and religious stories that continue to be believed by many people today. In this way, Ra√´lism can be seen as a form of Neo-Euhemerism that uses modern scientific knowledge and advancements to reinterpret ancient religious stories and reveal what it believes to be the true origins of humanity and our relationship to the universe.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Astronaut hypothesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Sendy\u0026#39;s conditions of coherence Wiki ‚Ä∫ Plurality of Gods External links # Euhemerism | Wikipedia n√©o-√©vh√©m√©risme | Wiktionary [FR] "},{"id":"138","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8/","title":"–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–∏","description":"–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –ó–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–∏, —Å–µ—Ä–∏—è –¥–æ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏–Ω, –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç—ã—Ö –Ø—Ö–≤–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —É—Ç–æ—á–Ω—è—é—Ç, —á—Ç–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å –≤–æ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∏ –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏—Ç—å –≤ –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –í–µ–∫, —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ –≠—Ä—ã –í–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ—è.","content":"In Ra√´lism üîØ # The New Commandments are constituted of the following aspects:\nGeniocracy Humanitarnism World Government The mission of the propagation of the Truth See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Geniocracy Wiki ‚Ä∫ Humanitarianism Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aquarius Read more # Resources ‚Ä∫ The Book Which Tells The Truth "},{"id":"139","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BC/","title":"–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –ò–µ—Ä—É—Å–∞–ª–∏–º","description":"–¢—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–π –•—Ä–∞–º, —Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Ç—å –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ê–ø–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–ø—Å–∏—Å–∞.","content":"New Jerusalem is a concept in the Christian tradition that refers to a heavenly city or a renewed, perfected earthly city. It is described in the Book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, as a place where God will dwell with his people and there will be no more death, suffering, or tears. The description of New Jerusalem includes details such as its size, shape, and beauty, with streets of gold, gates made of pearl, and a river of life flowing through the middle. It is seen as a symbol of the ultimate fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to his people and the hope for a better future. The concept of New Jerusalem has also been interpreted metaphorically as a vision of a more just and peaceful society on earth.\nOn the passages in the Book of Revelation says the following about New Jerusalem:\n\u0026ldquo;Then I saw \u0026lsquo;a new heaven and a new earth,\u0026rsquo; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.\u0026rdquo; - Revelation 21:1-2\nNew Jerusalem Dead Sea Scrolls # The New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of texts discovered in the 1950s and 1960s in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea. They are believed to have been written by a Jewish sect known as the Essenes, who lived in the area around the time of Jesus. The scrolls contain a wide range of texts, including biblical texts, apocalyptic literature, and community rules and regulations.\nOne of the most significant texts found among the New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scrolls is the \u0026ldquo;New Jerusalem Text,\u0026rdquo; which describes the end times and the coming of a new age. The text contains a vision of a new Jerusalem descending from heaven, and describes the restoration of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked. It also speaks of a messianic figure who will lead the righteous to salvation.\nOther texts found among the New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments of the book of Isaiah, which contain prophecies of the end times and the coming of a messiah, as well as a fragment of the book of Psalms, which contains a prayer for the coming of the new age. The scrolls also contain a number of rules and regulations for the Essene community, which give insight into their way of life and beliefs.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the second book, \u0026ldquo;To the People of Israel\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh explains how Jerusalem was foreseen to be location of renewal when the Golden Age arrives:\nThe State of Israel must give some territory located near Jerusalem to the Guide of Guides so that he may build there the residence, the embassy of the Elohim. The time has come, people of Israel, to build the New Jerusalem as it was foreseen. [\u0026hellip;] Reread your writings and open your eyes.\nWe wish to have our embassy among our descendants, and the people of Israel are the descendants of the children born of the unions between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTwo thousand years ago, you did not recognize our messenger, and it was not Jerusalem but Rome that shone. Now you have a new chance for it to be Jerusalem once more. If you do not seize it, another country will shelter our embassy, and you will no longer have any right to the land we had chosen for you.\nThe passage states that the time has come to build the New Jerusalem, as foretold in the writings. The people of Israel are considered the descendants of the children born of the unions between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men, and the Elohim wish to have their embassy among their descendants.\nThe passage also references the time 2,000 years ago when the people of Israel did not recognize Jesus as a messenger and how it resulted in the spread of Christianity. This time, they have a new chance to make Jerusalem shine again.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Apocalypse Wiki ‚Ä∫ Golden Age Wiki ‚Ä∫ Third Temple Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aquarius External links # New Jerusalem | Wikipedia New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scroll | Wikipedia New Jerusalem (Christian concept) | Britannica "},{"id":"140","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82/","title":"–ù–æ–µ–≤ –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç","description":"–ù–æ–µ–≤ –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –æ–±–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏–µ, –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏ —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø–∞, —É–Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ–∂–∏–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ—á—Ç–∏ –≤—Å–µ –∂–∏–≤–æ–µ –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –ó–µ–º–ª—è, –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –¥–æ–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —ç—Ç–æ –ø–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–ª–æ—Å—å. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø –±—ã–ª —Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ–º –ø—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π –º–µ—Ä—ã, –∏–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–∏–º –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å –∫–æ–Ω–µ—Ü –≤—Å–µ–º—É –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å—É, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–æ–º—É –∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –±—ã–ª —Å–æ—á—Ç–µ–Ω —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º –æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω—ã–º. –° –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –∏–∑–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤ –ù–æ—é –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–≤ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª –≤—Å–µ—Ö –∑–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –±—ã–ª —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ –±–æ—Ä—Ç—É –ö–æ–≤—á–µ–≥–∞, –æ—Ä–±–∏—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—è.","content":"Etymology # Covenant is not a common term in the English language. The word \u0026ldquo;covenant\u0026rdquo; came into Middle English as covenaunt from the Old French covenant, meaning agreement. This Old French term itself came from the Latin conveniens, which was the present participle of the verb convenio. The Latin verb convenio is made up of two parts: con- meaning together and -venio meaning to come. So, convenio means to come together or to agree. Its present participle form conveniens means agreeing, agreeable or convenient.\nIn the Biblical source text, the word employed is ◊ë÷∞÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊™ (brit) which is best translated as covenant or even alliance.\nIn the Bible # In the Bible, the covenant made between the Elohim and Noahs and his descendants is mentioned in Genesis 9:1-5.\nAnd God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, \u0026ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.2 The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered. 3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the greenplants, I give you everything. 4 But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # The passage which precedes the Biblical formalization of the Noahic covenant is mentioned by Yahweh during their encounter with Ra√´l.

They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.\n\u0026hellip;for the imagination of man‚Äôs heart is evil. Genesis 8: 21.\nThe creators were pleased to see that the humans had expressed gratitude for their preservation and promised not to try to destroy their creation again. They realized that it was natural for humans to desire scientific progress. Despite this, they acknowledged that the human heart can be prone to evil, as stated in Genesis 8:21. The preservation of life was seen as a positive outcome.

He was selected by the exiled Elohim group, led by Lucifer, to be saved from the impending cataclysm that was to wipe out life on Earth.\nBorn into the distinct community of Adamites, who were a unique human genus living during the time of the Garden of Eden, Noah distinguished himself through his character and actions.

In simpler terms, pantropy is like customizing people to fit different environments, instead of customizing environments to fit people.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Terraforming External links # Pantropy | Wikipedia "},{"id":"143","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC/","title":"–ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏–∑–º","description":"–ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏–∑–º, —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–¥–µ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ç–Ω–æ–π, –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –ø–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—É —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤. –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞ –∏ –æ–±–ª–µ–≥—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ª–∏—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏–∑–æ–±–∏–ª–∏–µ, –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è —Å–∞–º–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–∞–ª—é—Ç–æ–π —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è.","content":"Paradism is a concept that is often associated with a utopian vision of an ideal society, characterized by peace, equality, abundance, and harmony. In a paradisiacal society, it is believed that all individuals have their basic needs met and are free to pursue their passions and interests without the constraints of poverty, inequality, or oppression.\nSome popular depictions of paradism imagine a world where all forms of violence and exploitation have been eliminated, and where individuals live in harmony with each other and with the natural world. This may include ideas like the abolition of private property, the absence of a state, and the establishment of a cooperative and self-sustaining economy.\nOther interpretations of paradism emphasize spiritual aspects, envisioning a society where individuals have achieved a deep sense of inner peace and contentment, and are able to live in connection with the divine.\nTechno-utopia # Paradism can be contextualized in the contemporary dialogue with consideration to following aspects:\nPost-scarcity economy Technological determinism Transhumanism A techno-utopia is a hypothetical society in which technology has been used to create a perfect world, free from scarcity, inequality, and suffering. In a techno-utopia, technology is seen as the solution to all social and environmental problems, and is used to create a society that is sustainable, efficient, and maximally productive. The concept of techno-utopia has been a recurring theme in science fiction and is often associated with ideas of transhumanism and post-scarcity economics. However, many critics argue that a techno-utopia is impossible or even undesirable, as it ignores the complexities of human nature and the potential negative consequences of advanced technology.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter Meeting the Ancient Prophets, Yahweh says the following about the potential of establishing an Earthly paradise in the image of the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet:\nYou could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human well-being, instead of serving violence, armies, or the personal profit of a few.\nScience and technology can totally liberate humanity, not only from the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves, thanks to automation.\nAlready, in some of your most modern factories, where it used to take several hundred people to build one car, now only a single individual is needed to oversee a computer that commands and carries out all the car building operations. In the future, even that one person will be unnecessary. Workers\u0026rsquo; unions are not happy about this because factories are in less and less need of personnel and are letting more and more workers go. This is not normal ‚Äî these fantastic machines which do the work of 500 people should enable those 500 to really live, rather than enrich only one person, their boss.\nNo individual should be in the service of another, nor work for anyone for a salary. Machines can easily do all the chores and take care of all the work, enabling people to dedicate themselves to the one thing for which they were created ‚Äî to think, create and blossom.\nThe advancement of science and technology can liberate humanity from hunger and the obligation to work for a living by automating daily chores, but instead of benefiting only a few, these fantastic machines should enable people to live and dedicate themselves to creativity and personal growth.\nThe passage suggests that automation and technology have the potential to liberate humanity by freeing individuals from the obligation to work to live and by allowing them to dedicate themselves to more creative pursuits. The author argues that science and technology should serve human well-being, rather than violence or personal profit, and that machines can do much of the work that people currently do. The passage suggests that automation could lead to a more equitable and fulfilling.\nThe idea that science and technology can liberate humanity from work and solve many social problems, as well as the belief that automation can replace human labor, are both common themes in techno-utopianism. The concept of a \u0026ldquo;terrestrial paradise\u0026rdquo; achieved through technology and the vision of a future where machines take care of daily chores and enable people to focus on creative pursuits are also common elements in techno-utopian thinking.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Cyberparadism Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohimian home planet Wiki ‚Ä∫ Humanitarianism Wiki ‚Ä∫ New Commandments External links # Paradism | Spin-off organization of Ra√´lism Post-scarcity economy | Wikipedia Fully Automated Luxury Individualist Anarchism | Edmund Berger article Fully Automated Luxury Communism | Wikipedia "},{"id":"144","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B5/","title":"–ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏ –î–æ—Ä–º–µ","description":"–ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è –î–æ—Ä–º–µ , –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É–∑—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É–∑—Å–∫–∏–º –∞—Å—Å–∏—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–º –∏ —Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–º –≠–¥—É–∞—Ä–¥–æ–º –î–æ—Ä–º–µ (1881‚Äì1966), –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–º —Å–≤–æ–∏–º –±—É–∫–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º —Å—Ç–∏–ª–µ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É–∑—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ.","content":"The Dhorme a French Bible translation lead by the French Assyrologist and Semitologist √âdouard Dhorme (1881‚Äì1966). This version of the Bible is known to have kept the original Hebrew Elohim (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù) intact as to the infamous name of God. Monsieur Dhorme tried to preserve the original meaning as close as possible. In his own words, he says the following about how he and his team went about to come up with a new translation for the Biblical scriptures (in French):\nLe premier souci du traducteur doit √™tre la fid√©lit√© non seulement √† la pens√©e, mais encore √† l\u0026rsquo;expression de l\u0026rsquo;original. Sans tomber dans un mot-√†-mot intol√©rable, il faut chercher √† conserver √† la phrase sa saveur et sa couleur, autant que faire se peut, sans violer les lois de la langue fran√ßaise. Il est difficile de trouver le juste milieu entre un litt√©ralisme √©troit et une trop large interpr√©tation. C\u0026rsquo;est pouruoi, dans les cas o√π nous avons d√ª paraphraser un peu, nous donnons en note le sens propre des termes traduits. Lorsque le mot h√´breu doit √™tre cit√´, nous avons us√© du syst√®me de transcription g√©n√©ralement adopt√© et que nous employons depuis un demi-si√®cle. (p. IX, Pr√©face)\n‚Äî La Bible: Ancient Testament, Tome 1 (1956) by √âdouard Dhorme\nThe previous quote roughly translates to:\nThe first concern of the translator should be faithfulness not only to the original thought, but also to its expression. Without falling into an intolerable word-for-word translation, one should seek to preserve the flavor and color of the original sentence as much as possible, without violating the laws of the French language. It is difficult to find the right balance between narrow literalism and overly broad interpretation. Therefore, in cases where we had to paraphrase a bit, we give in a note the literal meaning of the translated terms. When the Hebrew word must be cited, we have used the transcription system generally adopted and which we have been using for half a century.\nThe passage is a preface to the French translation of the Old Testament of the Bible by √âdouard Dhorme. In it, Dhorme emphasizes the importance of faithfulness to both the thought and the expression of the original text, while still respecting the rules of the French language. He notes the difficulty in finding the right balance between literalism and interpretation, and when necessary, provides a literal meaning of translated terms in footnotes.\nAs such, Genesis starts with the following sentence in his translation:\n¬´ Au commencement √âlohim cr√©a les cieux et la terre. ¬ª\nIn the beginning, (the) Elohim created the heavens and the earth.\nL\u0026rsquo;Ancient Testament # Edouard Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French was considered a masterpiece of biblical scholarship for several reasons.\nFirstly, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was based on a rigorous philological and linguistic analysis of the original Hebrew text. He spent many years studying and mastering Hebrew, as well as the culture and historical context of the people who wrote the texts. This allowed him to create a translation that was faithful to the meaning and style of the original text, while also being accessible to a modern French audience.\nSecondly, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was informed by his deep knowledge of the history and archaeology of the Ancient Near East. He was one of the first scholars to use archaeological discoveries to shed light on the biblical texts, and his translations often include extensive footnotes and annotations that explain the historical and cultural context of the passages.\nFinally, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was praised for its literary qualities. He was a gifted writer and poet, and his translation captures the beauty and complexity of the original Hebrew text in a way that is often considered to be unparalleled in the field of biblical scholarship.\nOverall, Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French is widely regarded as a masterpiece of biblical scholarship because of its combination of philological rigor, historical and cultural insight, and literary quality.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s biography # √âdouard Dhorme (1881-1966) was a French orientalist and biblical scholar who made significant contributions to the study of the ancient Near East, particularly the history and literature of ancient Israel.\nDhorme was born on June 17, 1881, in Maisons-Alfort, a suburb of Paris, France. He was educated at the √âcole des Langues Orientales and the √âcole Biblique et Arch√©ologique Fran√ßaise in Jerusalem. He received his doctorate in Semitic philology in 1909 from the University of Paris, where he later became a professor of Hebrew and Jewish literature.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s scholarly work focused on the study of ancient Near Eastern languages, including Hebrew, Aramaic, and Akkadian. He was particularly interested in the Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible, and his research helped to shed light on the historical and cultural context in which these texts were written.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s best-known work is his translation of the Old Testament into French, which he completed in 1956. His translation was highly regarded for its faithfulness to the original Hebrew text, as well as its literary qualities. Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation was widely used by scholars and laypeople alike, and it remains an important reference work to this day.\nIn addition to his work on the Old Testament, Dhorme was a prolific author and editor of scholarly books and articles. He wrote extensively on topics such as the history of ancient Israel, the religion of the Hebrews, and the literature of the Old Testament. He also edited and translated several ancient Near Eastern texts, including the Ugaritic tablets and the Babylonian Talmud.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the study of the ancient Near East were recognized by his colleagues and peers. He was awarded the prestigious Prix Jules Huss in 1943 and was made a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1946. He also served as the director of the √âcole Biblique et Arch√©ologique Fran√ßaise in Jerusalem from 1935 to 1955.\nDhorme remained active in scholarship and teaching throughout his life, and he continued to publish important works well into his later years. He died on October 1, 1966, at the age of 85, leaving behind a rich legacy of scholarship and insight into the ancient Near East.\nToo high in knowledge # Edouard Dhorme became fascinated with the study of cuneiform alphabetic scriptures after the discovery of the unknown writing at Ras-Shamra in 1929. He began to decipher them and published a completed translation in 1931, competing with the German philologist Hans Bauer in the process. It was during this intense period of research into ancient scriptures and religious texts that Dhorme had profound reflections on his career and the meaning of his life. He decided to leave the √âcole Biblique in Jerusalem and the religious order to have more freedom to progress in his career and work on ancient scriptures. He also confessed to his family that he could no longer teach what he no longer believed in, having climbed too high in knowledge. In his own words (translated from the French):\n[\u0026hellip;] having climbed too high in knowledge, he could no longer teach what he no longer believed in.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s sudden departure from the √âcole Biblique in 1931 left the school in a state of confusion. A few months later, he left the religious order and was summoned to Rome by Pope Pius XI, where he was excommunicated. The details of the meeting remain unknown. Despite the excommunication, Dhorme remained attached to Catholic values and faith, and continued to attend Mass, especially towards the end of his life in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.\nIt is noteworthy that around 1930, on a boat departing from Egypt, Dhorme met a stylish and cultured widow named Mia (Maria Fran√ßoise Lepoint). It remains unclear whether this encounter influenced his decision to leave the religious order. Dhorme liked to say to his cousins, \u0026ldquo;we owe the truth only to ourselves,\u0026rdquo; without explaining what he meant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say with certainty what Dhorme meant by those words, as we can only speculate based on the information available. However, his departure from the √âcole Biblique and the Catholic Church, as well as his continuing attachment to the values of the faith, suggest that he may have undergone a crisis of faith or a conflict between his scholarly pursuits and his religious beliefs.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s interest in the study of ancient texts and religions, as well as his passion for the decipherment of the Ras-Shamra tablets, may have led him to question certain aspects of his religious beliefs. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that he felt his scholarly pursuits were incompatible with his role as a Catholic priest and scholar, and that he was no longer able to teach what he no longer believed in.\nHis decision to leave the √âcole Biblique and the Catholic Church, as well as his excommunication, suggest that he may have come into conflict with the church hierarchy over his scholarly work and beliefs. However, as the details of the meeting with Pope Pius XI are unknown, we cannot say for certain what transpired between them.\nBibliography # Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s first major publication was a critical edition of the Hebrew text of the Book of Job, published in 1926. He also produced numerous articles on biblical and Near Eastern studies, which were published in journals such as Revue Biblique and Melanges Syriens.\nOne of Dhorme\u0026rsquo;s most significant contributions to the field of Assyriology was his work on the Ras Shamra tablets. In 1929, he was one of the first scholars to study the tablets, which were discovered at the site of ancient Ugarit (in present-day Syria). He developed a method for deciphering the previously unknown alphabet in which the tablets were written, and his research led to a deeper understanding of the language and culture of ancient Syria.\nDhorme\u0026rsquo;s translation of the Old Testament into French, published in 1935, is considered a masterpiece of biblical scholarship. His translation was praised for its accuracy, clarity, and elegant style, and it became the standard French translation of the Old Testament for many years.\nIn addition to his work in biblical studies and Assyriology, Dhorme was also a prolific writer on a variety of topics related to religion, philosophy, and literature. His books include \u0026ldquo;La Notion de Dieu chez les Semites Occidentaux,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;La Philosophie de la Religion chez les Hebreux,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rsquo;Etre et le Phenomene.\u0026rdquo;\nA list of his major works:\nLe livre de Job: traduit et comment√© (1926) La religion assyro-babylonienne (1927) Les religions de Babylonie et d\u0026rsquo;Assyrie (1935) Le Cantique des cantiques: traduit et comment√© (1946) La Bible: Ancien Testament, Tome 1 (1956) La Bible: Ancien Testament, Tome 2 (1958) In Ra√´lism üîØ # The Dhorme Bible also happens to be the very same book that Claude Vorhilon aka Ra√´l had with him during his purported encounter with Yahweh.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible\nExternal links # La Bible: Ancient Testament (1956), [Paris] Gallimard.

It is an objective reality that exists independently of human opinion or belief, and it can be discovered through reason, empirical observation, and critical thinking.\nWhile truth can be difficult to discern, it is often associated with certain qualities or hallmarks, such as coherence, consistency, accuracy, and transparency. These qualities help to distinguish truth from falsehood, and they provide a standard by which truth claims can be evaluated.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In very simple terms, The Truth as understood from the lenses of Ra√´lism is that life on Earth was created by a group of scientists from a distant planet who had achieved a level of technical and scientific knowledge comparable to that which humans will soon reach.

The Forerunners\u0026rsquo; level of scientific advancement was so great that they managed to install a massive space station in orbit around the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s home planet. This station housed the entirety of their knowledge, which was programmed to automatically descend to the planet in the event of their civilization\u0026rsquo;s destruction. This act demonstrates their foresight and their intent to ensure the continuity of their knowledge and legacy, regardless of their own survival.\nThough their own world presumably perished due to an unidentified catastrophe, their technological marvel and wisdom lived on, as the Elohim inherited this knowledge, using it to develop their own civilization and eventually to create life on other planets, including Earth.\nInterestingly, despite their remarkable scientific progress, the Forerunners\u0026rsquo; civilization was not found elsewhere in the known universe by the Elohim. This has led to speculation that they may have faced a calamitous event, such as their sun exploding, becoming too cold, or their planet getting too close to the sun, rendering life unsustainable. Yet, their story remains a beacon of hope and continuity for both the Elohim and, through them, humanity on Earth. Should a similar catastrophe befall the Elohim, a similar arrangement is in place to pass on their knowledge, furthering the legacy of the Forerunners.\nIn the first book of the Ra√´lian canon, The Book Which Tells The Truth, the first allusion is being made by Yahweh:\nWe now reach a decisive turning point in the creators‚Äô work. They decided at that period to let humanity progress scientifically without ever intervening directly. They understood that they themselves had been created in the same way, and that by creating similar beings to themselves, they were allowing the cycle to continue.\nBut first, in order for the truth to be spread throughout the world, they decided to send a Messiah who would be able to communicate worldwide what the people of Israel were then the only ones to know. This was in preparation for the day when the original mystery would be explained in the light of scientific progress - that is to say, the revelation.\nAccording to the passage, the Elohim, after a period of direct intervention, decided to let humanity progress scientifically without their direct involvement. This decision, as per the narrative, was based on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s realization that they themselves were created in a similar manner by the Forerunners and that by creating beings similar to themselves, they were allowing this cycle of \u0026lsquo;creation, evolution, and non-interference\u0026rsquo; to continue.\nThe mention of a \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo; here refers to the figure of Jesus Christ in traditional Christian theology. However, within the Ra√´lian narrative, this role is slightly different. The Elohim, recognizing the need for their knowledge and the truth about humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins to be disseminated throughout the world, chose to send a messenger or \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo;. This individual, known to us as Jesus Christ, was tasked with spreading the knowledge that, at that time, only the people of Israel, the descendants of the Adamites, were privy to.\nThe passage suggests that this was a preparatory step, intended to lay the groundwork for a future time when the mystery of humanity\u0026rsquo;s origins and the role of the Elohim would be explained in the light of scientific progress, collectively known as the Truth. This suggests that the teachings of the \u0026ldquo;Messiah\u0026rdquo;, in this context, were meant to prepare humanity for the ultimate revelation about their cosmic origins.\nAnother allusion is made in the third book of the Ra√´lian canon, Let Us Welcome The Extra-Terrestrials. This time around, the recollection by Ra√´l is at odds with the statement made by Yahweh in the first book where the pivotal moment came during the Age of Aries and not right after the Great Flood. For sake of consistency, the reference made to the Forerunners is still noteworthy as it contains interesting details:\nIt was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer‚Äôs group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the ‚Äúark‚Äù. Satan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will ‚Äúself-destroy‚Äù when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.\nThis divergence from the account provided in the first book, The Book Which Tells The Truth, raises some questions about the consistency of the narrative timeline. However, it offers valuable insights into the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s understanding of their own creation and their decision-making process concerning the future of humanity.\nThe passage begins with the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s realization that they themselves were created scientifically, in a manner identical to how they created humanity. This discovery, according to the text, comes from an unmanned spaceship sent by the Forerunners, indicating the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s connection with their own creators.\nArmed with this new understanding, the Elohim made a decision not to destroy humanity. Instead, they chose to assist Lucifer\u0026rsquo;s group in re-implanting preserved life forms from the \u0026ldquo;ark\u0026rdquo;. This action and decision seem to illustrate a shift in the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s approach towards humanity. It also shows the existence of different perspectives within the council of the Eternals, with Yahweh and his majority group believing in humanity\u0026rsquo;s potential, while Satan, who plays out the role of a prosecutor of an oppositional party, remains skeptical.\nThe final part of the passage touches upon the destructive potential of scientific progress. Yahweh, interpreting the message from the unmanned spaceship, grasps that if humans turn violent, they could self-destruct upon discovering energies that elevate them to an interplanetary level of civilization. This understanding may hint at the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s reasons for adopting a non-interventionist stance, allowing humanity to navigate its own scientific advancement and moral evolution.\nReligion of the Elohim # The concept of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; within the Elohimian civilization, as described in Ra√´lism, diverges significantly from the traditional definitions found in many earthly religions. Rather than adherence to an alleged divine entity or a specific set of dogmatic principles, the Elohimian conception of religion is centered around the idea of \u0026ldquo;human genius.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Forerunners, the creators of the Elohim, are highly revered in the Elohimian civilization. The Elohim uphold their memory and deeply appreciate the knowledge and skills the Forerunners used to create them - the epitome of the \u0026ldquo;human genius.\u0026rdquo; This reverence forms the crux of the Elohimian religion: a collective relationship centered on the genius of their creators where the capacity for genius was passed down onto the Elohim themselves.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; in this context doesn\u0026rsquo;t restrict itself to humanity on Earth. Rather, it encompasses a broader and shared characteristic among different intelligent life forms across the cosmos - from the Forerunners to the Elohim and us humans on Earth. It implies a universal attribute inherent to these civilizations, denoting their capacity to manipulate, understand, and create life.\nTo the Elohim, the veneration of this \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; represents their principal form of worship. It\u0026rsquo;s not about worshipping an omniscient, omnipresent deity or a pantheon of god-like beings such as their own creators, the Forerunners. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s the profound respect and admiration for the abilities of intelligent life forms that have attained a level of knowledge and skill high enough to create new life forms. This form of worship could be considered a celebration of achievement, potential, and the limitless possibilities that knowledge and understanding can unlock.\nIn the Elohimian context, \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t refer to exceptional intellectual or creative power of individual humans on Earth. Instead, it signifies the capacity for intelligent life forms, such as the Elohim or their creators - the Forerunners, and perhaps one day the humans from Earth, to manipulate and understand the very fabric of life itself. This understanding extends to the ability to create life, as demonstrated by the Forerunners who created the Elohim, and the Elohim, in turn, creating human life on Earth.\nInterstellar lineage # The narrative that unfolds describes a lineage of creation that can be likened to a \u0026ldquo;cosmic evolution\u0026rdquo;, where intelligent life forms are not only evolving naturally but are actively being designed and propagated by previous generations of creators. This lineage spans across vast cosmic distances and includes different planetary civilizations.\nAt the apex of this cosmic lineage are the Forerunners, the enigmatic and highly advanced civilization that created the Elohim. The Forerunners demonstrated an incredible degree of scientific sophistication, mastering the art of life creation - a testament to their \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo;. The Forerunners were not just the product of evolution, but also the conscious designers of life, marking the first known point in this lineage of cosmic creation.\nFollowing the Forerunners are the Elohim, a civilization engineered by the genius of the Forerunners. Despite the absence of their creators, the Elohim inherited the profound knowledge of life manipulation and became creators in their own right. In this sense, they represent the next step in this cosmic evolution, carrying forward the legacy of their creators and demonstrating the same capability to engineer life.\nThis cosmic lineage extends to humanity on Earth, another creation of the Elohim using the knowledge inherited from the Forerunners. This places humanity as a part of this cosmic chain of life creation, suggesting that humans, too, could one day attain the level of scientific understanding necessary to create life.\nEach stage of this cosmic evolution involves inhabiting and adapting to new planetary environments, in a sense, conquering new worlds. This progression is pantropic in nature, as each new civilization is not just adapting to different environments but is also, thanks to the technology left behind by previous generations, able to shape these environments to better suit their needs.\nThis cosmic lineage, as outlined by Ra√´lism, presents a remarkable vision of life\u0026rsquo;s potential - a vision where the torch of \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; passes from one civilization to the next, each inheriting and adding to the knowledge of the previous, in an endless journey of cosmic exploration and creation.\nAd infinitum # The narrative becomes even more intriguing when we consider the possibility that the Forerunners themselves might not be the original link in this cosmic lineage. If the Elohim were created by the Forerunners, and humans by the Elohim, it stands to reason that the Forerunners might also have been created by a preceding civilization - an even more ancient and advanced species that mastered the science of life creation before them.\nThis hypothetical civilization, which we could term the \u0026ldquo;Precursors,\u0026rdquo; would represent another layer of depth to this cosmic evolution. It would mean that the Forerunners were themselves recipients of a heritage of scientific knowledge and life-creating capacity, much as the Elohim and humans are.\nThis possibility further emphasizes the concept of an unending chain of creation and exploration, each civilization passing on the torch of \u0026ldquo;human genius\u0026rdquo; to the next. It expands the cosmic lineage into a potentially infinite regress of creators and creations, each taking its place in a grand cosmic evolution, spanning across vast eons and countless worlds.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Intelligent Design Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering "},{"id":"147","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–ü—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏—è","description":"–ü—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏—è, —É—Å—Ç–æ–π—á–∏–≤–æ–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ä–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ—Å–∏ –≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –ó–µ–º–ª–∏. –ü—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏—è ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å–µ –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ó–µ–º–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –æ—Å–∏ (–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–æ–π —Ü–∏–∫–ª) –∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –°–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–∞ (–≥–æ–¥). –ü–æ–ª–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–µ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ü–∏–∫–ª –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç 25 920 –ª–µ—Ç.","content":"The natural cause that accounts for the cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic is called precession and is defined in regards to its impact on the planet Earth as the steady change of orientation of the axis of rotation of Earth. In other words, besides the two fundamental motions of our planet Earth, the rotation of the planet around its own axis which we call the day/night cycle, and the revolution of the planet in its orbit around the Sun which we call the year cycle, there is a third key motion which accounts for yet another important cycle, but which lasts too long for us to take notice. This third key motion is called the precession of the equinoxes or sometimes just simply precession.\nThe precession of the equinoxes is the slow, cyclical movement of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis in space. This movement causes the position of the celestial poles and the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s axis to change over time, which in turn affects the position of the sun relative to the stars and the equinoxes.\nThe equinoxes are the two points in the year when the sun is directly over the equator, causing equal amounts of daylight and darkness around the world. However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the position of the sun relative to the stars and the equinoxes changes over time, causing the equinoxes to slowly move through the zodiac.\nThe precession of the equinoxes is a slow process, taking approximately 26'000 years to complete one cycle. It is caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial bulge, which causes the rotational axis to slowly change direction.\nIn astrology and some esoteric traditions, the precession of the equinoxes is seen as having spiritual and philosophical significance, with each era of the precession being associated with a different astrological age and a different spiritual paradigm.\nCause # The precession of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon acting upon the equatorial bulge of the Earth. Earth\u0026rsquo;s equatorial diameter is about 43 km larger than its polar diameter, creating a slight bulge around the equator.\nThe gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on this bulge causes a torque that changes the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. The torque causes the rotational axis to move in a circular path, tracing out a cone over time. This is called precession.\nAdditionally, Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle, but an ellipse. As a result, the Sun\u0026rsquo;s gravitational force on Earth varies over the course of a year. This also contributes to the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis.\nThe combined effect of these gravitational forces causes the direction of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis to change over time, tracing out a complete circle in a period of approximately 26,000 years. The precession of Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis has important implications for our understanding of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate and seasons.\nAxial tilt # The axial tilt of the Earth, also known as the obliquity of the ecliptic, refers to the angle at which the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt is currently about 23.5 degrees and is responsible for the changing seasons on Earth.\nThe precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis affects the axial tilt in a couple of ways. First, the precession changes the direction of the rotational axis over time, which means that the axial tilt is changing as well. This means that the direction of the axial tilt relative to the stars is constantly shifting.\nSecond, the precession also changes the angle at which the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is tilted relative to the ecliptic plane. Over time, the axial tilt can vary from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees due to the precession. This variation in axial tilt has important implications for the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate, as it can affect the distribution of sunlight on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface and, in turn, the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate patterns.\nIn summary, the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis is related to the axial tilt in that it affects the direction and angle of the axial tilt over time.\nNorth Pole star # The current North Pole star, also known as the North Star or Polaris, is a star located near the celestial north pole. The celestial north pole is the point in the sky directly above the Earth\u0026rsquo;s North Pole.\nDue to the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis, the position of the celestial north pole changes over time, and as a result, the North Star also changes. This means that over a period of approximately 26,000 years, a different star will be located near the celestial north pole and will serve as the North Star.\nCurrently, Polaris is located very close to the celestial north pole and is therefore used as a reference point for navigation and astronomical observations. However, as the precession continues, the position of the celestial north pole will gradually move away from Polaris, and a different star will eventually become the North Star.\nIn about the year 14,000 AD, the North Star is expected to be the bright star Vega. So, as the precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis continues, the North Star will gradually shift from Polaris to Vega and then to other stars over time.\nZodiac # The precession of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis also affects the position of the stars in the sky and, as a result, the apparent position of the constellations. This has important implications for the zodiac, which is a band of the sky divided into twelve equal parts, each named for the constellation that appears in that part of the sky.\nDue to precession, the position of the celestial equator and the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, changes over time. This means that the position of the constellations relative to the Sun also changes over time. As a result, the apparent position of the constellations along the ecliptic and the zodiac changes over time.\nIn ancient times, the zodiac was based on the positions of the constellations along the ecliptic at that time. However, due to the precession, the position of the constellations has shifted over time, so that the zodiac signs as they were defined thousands of years ago no longer align with the position of the constellations in the sky today.\nThe twelve constellations of the zodiac were defined by the ancient Babylonians over 2,000 years ago. They named each of the twelve equal parts of the ecliptic, or the band of the sky along which the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to move, after a different constellation.\nThese constellations were chosen because they were easily recognizable and distinct from one another. They included Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces.\nThe Babylonians believed that the positions of these constellations along the ecliptic were significant and that they had astrological implications for the future. This idea was later adopted by the ancient Greeks and became an integral part of astrology and astronomical observations.\nOver time, the twelve constellations of the zodiac have become widely recognized and are still used in astrology today, although the positions of the constellations relative to the zodiac have changed due to precession. Despite this, the names and symbolic associations of the twelve constellations of the zodiac have remained largely unchanged for thousands of years and continue to be used in astrology and astronomical observations.\nThe 4 Cardinal days # An equinox is the time when the Sun is directly overhead the equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal all over the world. There are two equinoxes in a year: the Vernal Equinox (around March 20th or 21st) and the Autumnal Equinox (around September 22nd or 23rd).\nA solstice is the time when the Sun is at its farthest point from the equator, resulting in the longest or shortest day of the year, depending on the hemisphere. There are two solstices in a year: the Summer Solstice (around June 20th or 21st) and the Winter Solstice (around December 21st or 22nd).\nThe four cardinal days - the two equinoxes and two solstices - mark the changing of the seasons and have been significant to many cultures throughout history for various astronomical, agricultural, and cultural reasons.\nDue to precession, the position of the celestial equator and the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit around the Sun, changes over time. As a result, the position of the equinoxes, which are the two points in the sky where the Sun appears to cross the celestial equator and mark the start of spring and autumn, also changes over time.\nThe equinoxes were used by ancient astronomers and astrologers to determine the position of the zodiac and the constellations along the ecliptic. The equinoxes were considered important because they represented the start of spring and autumn and marked the beginning of new seasons.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # Mauro Biglino writes in his book The Book That Will Forever Change Our Idea About The Bible the following about the precession:\nThis expression indicates the celestial phenomenon caused by the oscillation or wobble of the Earth axis making a circular motion similar to that of a slowly-spinning top. This oscillation results in an apparent demotion of the constellations in the celestial sphere. It happens because the imaginary line joining the ecliptic of spring and autumn equinoxes moves one degree approximately every 71 years. Each of the twelve signs of the zodiac that form the entire 360¬∞ sky arc, covered a period of 2,160 years, corresponding to what astrology labeled as ‚ÄúAges‚Äù: Age of Aries, Age of Taurus, and so on. The complete cycle of 360¬∞ thus requires a little less than 26,000 years (2160 x 12). Hence, it would have been impossible to observe and calculate. Regardless, this long period, called the ‚ÄúGreat Year‚Äù, was known by many civilizations in various parts of the world such as the Indus Valley, Egypt, Central America; and still today scholars wonder how a nomadic people of herders and farmers were able to calculate its duration! Might it have been of any use to ANUNNAKI ‚Äúgods‚Äù to calculate the orbital timing of their home planet, and to plan their space travels that were inevitably very long? Perhaps, the answer to many mysteries resides in accepting this possibility\u0026hellip;\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Great Year External links # Axial precession Precession of the equinoxes | Britannica "},{"id":"148","href":"/ru/wiki/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA/","title":"–ü—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫","description":"–ü—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫, —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ—Å–æ–ª, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º –æ—Ç –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏-—Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤—à–µ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏–∏. –ù–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤—Å–µ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –ª—é–¥–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∏–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω—ã —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫–∞–º–∏. –ö–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –∏–∑ –Ω–∏—Ö –ª–∏–±–æ –≤–æ–æ–±—â–µ –≤–¥–æ—Ö–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª –Ω–æ–≤–æ–µ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –ª–∏–±–æ, –ø–æ –∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ–π –º–µ—Ä–µ, –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª –ø–∏—Å—å–º–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é –∏–ª–∏ —É—Å—Ç–Ω—É—é —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—é. –í –ª—é–±–æ–º —Å–ª—É—á–∞–µ, –≤ –∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ–º –∏—Ç–æ–≥–µ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤—É—è —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é –∏ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ.","content":"A prophet is a person who is believed to have a special connection to a deity or divine power and is said to receive divine revelations, messages, or guidance that they then communicate to others.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo; is used in various religious contexts, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and other traditions. The original meaning of the term is someone who speaks for a deity, translating divine will and wisdom to humanity.\nIn many religious traditions, a prophet is considered to be a special intermediary between the divine and human realms and is often seen as a messenger of divine truth, moral guidance, or warning of impending judgment.\nIn some religious traditions, the role of a prophet is also seen as one of a moral and spiritual guide, helping individuals and communities to understand the will of the divine and to live in accordance with divine principles.\nEtymology # The English word \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo; comes from the Greek word \u0026ldquo;prophetes,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;one who speaks forth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;one who speaks for.\u0026rdquo; This word is derived from the verb \u0026ldquo;propheteuo,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;to speak forth\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to speak for.\u0026rdquo;\nIn ancient Greece, the word \u0026ldquo;prophetes\u0026rdquo; was used to refer to someone who was considered a mouthpiece for the gods, speaking on their behalf and communicating their will and messages to the people.\nThis Greek word was later adopted and used in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, to translate the Hebrew word \u0026ldquo;nabi,\u0026rdquo; which is commonly used to refer to a prophet in Jewish and Christian traditions.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the third book, Let Us Welcome The Extra-Terrestrials, the following is said about the meaning of prophet:\nProphet from the Greek prophetes means ‚Äúthe one who reveals‚Äù.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Abraham Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of prophets and religions External links # Prophet | Wikipedia Prophecy | Britannica Prophets and Prophecy | Jewish Encyclopedia "},{"id":"149","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB/","title":"–†–∞–∑—É–º–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–µ–ª","description":"–†–∞–∑—É–º–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–µ–ª, –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–∏—Ä—É—é—â–∞—è –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä–∞–¥–∏–≥–º–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ. –≠—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –±—ã –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º —Ç–æ–≥–æ, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–æ, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±—ã –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º—ã —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤ –≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏–∏ ex-nihilo.","content":"Intelligent Design (ID) is a theory that suggests that certain features of the natural world, particularly in biology and biochemistry, are best explained by an intelligent cause rather than by natural selection or other purely naturalistic processes. Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that the complexity and apparent design found in the natural world provide evidence of a supernatural designer, often referred to as a \u0026ldquo;intelligent agent,\u0026rdquo; that is responsible for the creation and development of life.\nIntelligent Design differs from traditional creationism, which asserts that the universe and all life were created by God in six literal 24-hour days, in that it does not make specific claims about the identity or nature of the intelligent agent responsible for the design in the natural world.\nIntelligent Design has been the subject of much controversy and criticism, particularly in the scientific community. Critics argue that ID is not a scientifically valid explanation for the natural world, as it does not provide testable hypotheses or make predictions that can be verified through empirical observation. Additionally, ID is often seen as a political and religious movement rather than a scientific theory, and many have argued that its ultimate goal is to introduce religious concepts into science classrooms.\nAs a result of these criticisms, Intelligent Design is not widely accepted in the scientific community and is not taught as a scientific theory in public schools. However, it continues to be a topic of discussion and debate among scientists, philosophers, and religious scholars.\nWatchmaker Analogy # Most arguments in favour of Intelligent Design can be summarized with the Watchmaker Analogy. The Watchmaker Analogy, also known as the Argument from Design, is often used to support the idea of Intelligent Design. The argument goes as follows: if we come across a watch, we can deduce that it was designed by an intelligent watchmaker rather than being formed randomly by natural forces. In the same way, when we look at the complexity of living organisms, we can deduce that they were designed by an intelligent creator.\nProponents of this argument argue that the complexity of biological organisms, such as the intricate machinery of the cell, the genetic code, and the intricate ecosystems, cannot be explained by random chance or natural selection alone. Instead, they suggest that an intelligent creator must have designed life as we know it.\nCritics of the Watchmaker Argument argue that it is flawed because it assumes that complexity is evidence of design, and that natural processes are not capable of producing complex structures. They also argue that it is difficult to prove the existence of an intelligent creator, and that attributing the complexity of life to such a creator only raises further questions about the creator\u0026rsquo;s origins and design.\nSome more specific arguments that have been put forward in favor of Intelligent Design:\nIrreducible complexity: Proponents of Intelligent Design argue that certain biological systems are irreducibly complex, meaning that they could not have arisen through natural selection alone. They point to complex biological structures like the human eye or the bacterial flagellum as examples of structures that cannot be explained by evolution alone. They argue that the existence of such structures is evidence of intelligent designers.\nThe complexity of biological systems: Advocates of Intelligent Design argue that biological systems such as DNA, cellular structures, and biochemical pathways are too complex to have arisen solely through natural processes. They argue that such complexity is more easily explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nThe fine-tuning of the conditions for life: Advocates of Intelligent Design point to the fine-tuning of physical constants such as the cosmological constant and the strength of gravity that allow for the existence of life. They argue that such fine-tuning is unlikely to be the result of chance and is instead evidence of design.\nThe origin of genetic information: Advocates of Intelligent Design argue that the origin of genetic information in the first living organisms is difficult to explain through natural selection and random mutation alone. They suggest that the complexity of the genetic code and the mechanisms of gene expression are better explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nInformation layer: Another argument related to the previous entry of the origin of genetic information is the complexity of the information layer found in living organisms. DNA, for example, is a complex code that contains information about an organism\u0026rsquo;s traits and functions. It has been argued that the level of complexity and specificity of this information cannot be attributed to purely natural processes, and that an intelligent designer is the best explanation for this phenomenon. Proponents of intelligent design argue that the information contained in DNA and other biological systems is evidence of a purposeful design, rather than a result of random chance or natural selection.\nThe sudden appearance of major groups of organisms in the fossil record: Some advocates of Intelligent Design argue that the sudden appearance of major groups of organisms in the fossil record without clear evolutionary precursors is evidence of design. They argue that this pattern is inconsistent with gradual evolutionary change and more easily explained by the intervention of intelligent designers.\nAbiogenesis: The origin of life from non-living matter has yet to be fully explained by naturalistic processes. Despite numerous attempts, scientists have not been able to recreate the conditions and processes that would lead to the formation of a living organism from inorganic matter. The complexity and sophistication of even the simplest living cell suggest that it was not the result of chance or natural processes, but rather the product of intelligent design.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Ra√´lism, the concept of intelligent design is seen in the context of the Elohim, who are believed to be the extraterrestrial creators of humanity. The Elohim are highly advanced beings who possess a deep understanding of science and technology, and they used this knowledge to create humans using genetic engineering.\nWithin the scope of Intelligent Design, the notion of \u0026ldquo;directed design\u0026rdquo; as presented in Ra√´lism can be seen as a subtype. In this case, the intelligent cause is not an omnipotent deity or a metaphysical force but a succession of scientifically advanced civilizations. These civilizations, starting from the Forerunners, deliberately and consciously manipulate biological processes to create and improve life forms.\nThis \u0026ldquo;directed design\u0026rdquo; shares the common core belief of Intelligent Design that an intelligent cause is responsible for the complexity and diversity of life. However, it provides a unique twist by assigning this role to physically and scientifically advanced entities rather than a spiritual or divine being.\nIn the case of Ra√´lism, the directed design further extends to propose a lineage of creators, each civilization passing on its acquired knowledge and enhancements to the next, creating a chain of cosmic evolution. It\u0026rsquo;s a model that combines elements of both creation and evolution, attributing the origins and progression of life to the purposeful actions of advanced civilizations.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Cosmic evolution Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Forerunners Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Intelligent Design Resources ‚Ä∫ The Book Which Tells The Truth External links # Intelligent Design | Wikipedia Intelligent Design | Britannica "},{"id":"150","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0/","title":"–°–∞–º—Å–∞—Ä–∞","description":"–°–∞–Ω—Å–∞—Ä–∞ , –±—É–¥–¥–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ, –¥–∂–∞–π–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏ –∏–Ω–¥—É–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–µ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ –∏ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –•–æ—Ç—è —Å–∞–º–æ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–ª–æ–≤–æ –Ω–µ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–Ω–æ–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º, –°–∞–º—Å–∞—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ —Ü–∏–∫–ª—É –ø–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—è—é—â–µ–≥–æ—Å—è —Å–∞–º–æ—Ä–∞–∑—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏—è, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–∑–∂–∏–≥–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã –∏ —Å–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–≤–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤. –ü—Ä–µ–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–∞ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ –∏ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤—ã—Å—à–∏–º —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–µ–º –¥–ª—è –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –≤–µ–∫ –∏–∑–æ–±–∏–ª–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è.","content":"Samsara is a concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and other Indian religions that refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. According to these traditions, all living beings are trapped in a cycle of existence, in which they are constantly being reborn into different forms.\nSamsara is believed to be driven by the law of karma, which states that every action has consequences and that the nature of these consequences will determine the circumstances of one\u0026rsquo;s next life. Good actions lead to positive experiences and rebirth into higher states of being, while negative actions lead to suffering and rebirth into lower states of being.\nThe goal of many religious practices in Indian religions is to break free from the cycle of samsara and achieve liberation or enlightenment. This is often accomplished through spiritual discipline, meditation, and other spiritual practices, which are believed to help one purify the mind and attain a state of pure consciousness that is free from the cycle of rebirth.\nIn Buddhism ‚ò∏Ô∏è # Sa·πÉsƒÅra (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞, Pali: sa·πÉsƒÅra) is a concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, and other Indian religions, referring to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. According to this concept, all living beings are trapped in this cycle, and the goal is to break free from it and attain liberation. In Hinduism, this is achieved by attaining moksha, while in Buddhism it is achieved by attaining enlightenment, or nirvana.\nThe cycle of sa·πÉsƒÅra is driven by karma, which is the accumulation of one\u0026rsquo;s actions and intentions. One\u0026rsquo;s karma determines the circumstances of their birth and their experiences in life. Depending on the nature of their karma, a being may be reborn into a higher or lower state of existence, such as a human, animal, or spirit realm.\nThe cycle of sa·πÉsƒÅra is often depicted as a wheel, or the Bhavacakra, with twelve houses representing the different stages of life and existence. Breaking free from the cycle of sa·πÉsƒÅra requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the cessation of one\u0026rsquo;s attachment and aversion.\nThe Wheel of Life (Bhavacakra) # The Bhavacakra (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡§µ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞; PƒÅli: bhavacakka; Tibetan: ‡Ω¶‡æ≤‡Ω≤‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ω†‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω†‡ΩÅ‡Ωº‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ω£‡Ωº, Wylie: srid pa\u0026rsquo;i \u0026lsquo;khor lo), also known as the Wheel of Life, is a symbolic representation of sa·πÉsƒÅra (or cyclic existence) is a symbolic representation of samsara, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in Buddhism. It is usually depicted as a wheel with twelve houses, each house representing a different aspect of samsara and its causes and effects.\nThe outer rim of the wheel depicts the twelve links of dependent origination, which show how ignorance and craving lead to suffering and rebirth. The three animals at the center of the wheel represent the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, which keep beings trapped in samsara. The image serves as a visual reminder of the Buddhist teachings on the nature of existence and the path to liberation.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the second book Book Which Tells The Truth, 2nd Chapter, Buddhism, Yahweh demystifies a core tenet of Buddhism:\nBuddhism explains that at the time of death, the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils, otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle. On the other hand, if it manages to escape those infamous devils, it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening.\nIn fact, this is a very good description, which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole. It must resist those devils, which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position to choose. Those \u0026ldquo;devils\u0026rdquo; are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature, and the \u0026ldquo;state of bliss through awakening\u0026rdquo; is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people, thus producing an earthly paradise, where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means.\nIf humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils, it will fall back into the cycle of reincarnation, where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world, with all the suffering which that entails.\nThat is why we can find the swastika in our symbol, as in numerous ancient writings, which signifies \u0026ldquo;the cycle\u0026rdquo;. It is the choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.\nAccording to the excerpt, the swastika is a symbol for the eternal recurrence, which is the idea that history repeats itself in cycles. The swastika is associated with the cycle because it represents the choice between a golden age of civilization, where science serves the people and creates an earthly paradise, and a primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it. In this context, the swastika symbolizes the choice between escaping the cycle of suffering and achieving a state of bliss through overcoming and awakening or being trapped in the cycle of reincarnation of the whole human species and growing another global civilization from anew.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Apocalypse Wiki ‚Ä∫ Golden Age Wiki ‚Ä∫ Swastika External links # Sa·πÉsƒÅra Bhavacakra | Wikipedia "},{"id":"151","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0/","title":"–°–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–∞","description":"–°–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ (≈õƒÅ·π≠ƒÅn, –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç: ◊©÷∏◊Ç◊ò÷∏◊ü), –Ω–µ –ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Å –õ—é—Ü–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–º, —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∞ (◊ê÷±◊ú◊ï÷π◊î÷∑÷º) –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º —Ñ—Ä–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞ (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù), –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞—é—â–µ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏-–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑–∞ –∏—Ö –æ—Ç–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—é. –¢–∞–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º, —Å–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –∏–º—è —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ, –∞ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞ —Ä–æ–ª–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Å–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–∞, –∞ –∏–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ ‚Äî –ø—Ä–µ–ø—è—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ, –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è –∏–ª–∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è.","content":"Satan, also commonly referred to as the Devil, is a figure in many religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In these traditions, Satan is often depicted as a powerful, malevolent spirit who opposes God and tempts humans to sin.\nIn the Bible, Satan is first mentioned in the book of Job as a member of God\u0026rsquo;s court who challenges Job\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness. Later, in the New Testament, Satan is depicted as a tempter who seeks to lead Jesus astray in the wilderness. In the Christian tradition, Satan is often seen as the embodiment of evil, the prince of demons, and the ruler of Hell.\nEtymology # The word Satan comes from the Hebrew word ◊î÷∑◊©÷∏÷º◊Ç◊ò÷∏◊ü (ha-Satan), which means the accuser or the adversary. In the Hebrew Bible, the term Satan was used to refer to a divine being who acted as a prosecuting attorney in God\u0026rsquo;s court, accusing individuals of wrongdoing and testing their faithfulness. This understanding of Satan was adopted by early Christians and later became central to the development of the Christian idea of Satan as a tempter and the enemy of God.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Satan is an Eloha who opposes to the creation of other intelligent beings and believed that all beings on Earth, in particular the humans, should be destroyed due to their violence. Yahweh says the following about Satan:\nIn the Book of Job, Chapter 1, you have the explanation of Satan:\nNow there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.\n‚Äî Job 1: 6.\nElohim in Hebrew literally means \u0026ldquo;those who came from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim. But one of these Elohim, called Satan, was part of a group, which had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on a planet as close as the Earth, seeing them as a possible threat. That is why, on seeing Job\u0026rsquo;s devotion, which was one of the best examples of human beings loving their creators, he said:\nDoth Job fear Elohim for nought?\u0026hellip; But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And Yahweh said unto Satan, \u0026lsquo;Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.\u0026rsquo;\n‚Äî Job 1: 9-12.\nHearing Satan\u0026rsquo;s assertion that had Job not been rich, he would not have loved his creators, the government gave full power to Satan to ruin Job. It would then be seen if he still venerated his creators, and that is why killing him was forbidden.\nOn seeing Job\u0026rsquo;s dedication to respecting his creators, even when he was ruined, the government triumphed over the opposition, Satan. But Satan retorted that though Job had lost many things, he was still in good health. So the government gave Satan carte blanche so long as he did not kill Job:\nBehold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.\n‚Äî Job 2: 6.\nThe passage discusses the story of Satan in the Book of Job, where Satan is one of the \u0026ldquo;sons of Elohim\u0026rdquo; who report to their planet of origin about human behavior. Satan is part of a group that had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on Earth and viewed them as a possible threat. When Satan sees Job\u0026rsquo;s devotion to his creators, he questions whether Job would still love them if he were not rich. Satan is then given power to ruin Job to test his loyalty to the creators, with the condition that he does not kill him. Despite Job\u0026rsquo;s losses, he still respects and venerates his creators, which leads to the government\u0026rsquo;s triumph over Satan.\nIn Ra√´l\u0026rsquo;s third book, the following is said about Satan:\nBut Satan doesn‚Äôt give up over this, as what he wishes is that all the beings that have been created, be totally destroyed, because he judges them to be dangerous, due to their violence. As time passes, Satan accumulates proof of Man‚Äôs aggression by observing the way in which humans kill each other with the weapons that are given to them by the sons of Lucifer‚Äôs exiled group of Elohim. The latter is involved in ‚Äútender‚Äù relations with the daughters of men who manage to receive weapons in exchange for their charms, under the false pretense of giving them to their fathers or brothers so that they can hunt for food. In fact, men choose to fight abominable battles among themselves with this arsenal.\nIn this excerpt, it is explained that Satan wants all beings to be destroyed because he considers them dangerous, due to their violence. He observes how humans kill each other with weapons provided by the exiled group of Elohim. The Elohim provide these weapons to the humans under the guise of using them for hunting, but the humans use them to engage in violent battles with each other. Satan accumulates proof of human aggression and uses it to support his belief that all beings should be destroyed.\nIn the given excerpts, Satan is portrayed as a being who believes that only evil can be expected from humans. He is opposed to the idea that there are positive and non-violent humans who are full of love and fraternity. Satan\u0026rsquo;s role appears to be one of accusing humans and presenting them in a negative light. It seems that he is not in favor of saving humanity from destruction and is more aligned with the belief that humanity is inherently evil.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Lucifer Wiki ‚Ä∫ Yahweh Wiki ‚Ä∫ Elohim Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ra√´lism External links # Satan | Wikipedia Satan | Britannica "},{"id":"152","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/","title":"–°–≤–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞","description":"–°–≤–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞, —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–π –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª, –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–º–∏ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–º–∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞–º–∏ –∏ –ø–æ —Å–µ–π –¥–µ–Ω—å. –•–æ—Ç—è –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∞—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ–º –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—è, —É–¥–∞—á–∏ –∏ –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∫–æ–Ω–Ω–æ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è–º–∏, –≤ —Ä–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º–µ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–æ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π —Ü–∏–∫–ª–∏—á–µ—Å–∫—É—é –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤–µ—á–Ω—É—é –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Ä—ã–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ (–±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å).","content":"The swastika is a symbol that has been used for thousands of years in various cultures and traditions. It typically consists of a cross with arms that bend at a right angle in one or both directions. The symbol is most commonly associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, where it is considered to be a symbol of good luck, prosperity, and auspiciousness.\nThe origin of the swastika is considered uncertain, but it has been found in archaeological remains and artifacts from many cultures and civilizations dating back thousands of years, including ancient Greece, China, and the Indus Valley Civilization. In Hinduism, the swastika is considered to be a symbol of the sun, and is used to represent the idea of cyclical change, or the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth.\nHowever, the swastika is also infamous for its use by the Nazi party in Germany as the symbol of their ideology of racism and antisemitism. During World War II, the swastika became a symbol of Nazi power and aggression, and it is now widely associated with hatred and intolerance.\nDue to its historical association with the Nazi regime, the display of the swastika is illegal in many countries and its use is restricted in others. In many Western countries, the swastika is widely seen as a symbol of hate and is strongly discouraged.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In the first book of the Ra√´lian canon, \u0026ldquo;The Book Which Tells The Truth\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh elaborates on the symbolism depicted on the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s machines and attire:\nThe emblem you see engraved on this machine and on my suit represents the truth. It is also the emblem of the Jewish people, the Star of David, which means: ‚ÄúThat which is above is like that which is below‚Äù, and in its center is the swastika, which means that everything is cyclic, the top becoming the bottom, and the bottom in turn becoming the top. The origins and destiny of the creators and human beings are similar and linked.\nHave ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? Isaiah 40: 21.\nThis emblem, recognized as the Star of David, carries profound significance in the narrative.\nAccording to Yahweh, the Star of David encapsulates a philosophical tenet, essentially stating that \u0026ldquo;that which is above is like that which is below\u0026rdquo;. This aphorism signifies the interconnectedness and mirroring of higher and lower realms, suggesting that the phenomena observed in the cosmos (the \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo;) are reflected on Earth (the \u0026ldquo;below\u0026rdquo;). This principle also implies the symmetry between the creators (the Elohim) and their creations (humans), reinforcing the inherent connection and mutual destiny they share.\nWithin the center of the Star of David in this emblem is the swastika, an ancient symbol often associated with cyclical progression or eternal recurrence. In this context, the swastika symbolizes the cyclical nature of existence, whereby the top becomes the bottom, and vice versa. This reflects the concept that states and conditions are transient and cyclically recurring, which can also denote the cyclic evolution and transformation of civilizations or species, including the creators and their synthetic progeny.\nThese symbols serve to reinforce the complex, intertwined relationships between the creators and the created, and the cyclical nature of existence and evolution. The reference to Isaiah 40:21 suggests a call for understanding these principles, which have been integral to the cosmic narrative from the beginning.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Menorah Wiki ‚Ä∫ Raelian Symbol of Infinity Wiki ‚Ä∫ Star of David External links # Swastika | Wikipedia Swastika | Britannica "},{"id":"153","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F/","title":"–°–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—è","description":"–°–∞–∫—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—è , –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏—è –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–∞ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ —Ä—è–¥–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä, –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –∞—Ä—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞—è, —á—Ç–æ –∏—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–º—ã—Å–ª–∞ –≤ —Å–≤–æ—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É, —ç—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏–µ —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–º—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ—Ä—Ü–∏–π –∏, —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ, –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–≤ –æ—Ç–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–∫–∏ –ø–∞–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤, –Ω–∞–º–µ–∫–∞—é—â–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –æ–±—â—É—é —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—é –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –º—É–¥—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏.","content":"Sacred geometry is a term used to describe the use of geometric shapes and patterns in religious and spiritual beliefs, art, architecture, and design. The idea is that the fundamental principles of geometry are reflections of the fundamental laws of the universe and that these shapes and patterns have spiritual significance.\nIn many cultures and traditions, sacred geometry is used to represent the interconnectedness of all things, to symbolize the divine, and to express spiritual ideas through the use of geometric shapes and patterns. For example, the circle is often seen as a symbol of unity, wholeness, and the infinite, while the square represents stability, balance, and the earth.\nIn architecture and design, sacred geometry is used to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing structures, such as the use of the golden ratio in the design of buildings, sculptures, and paintings. In spirituality, sacred geometry is often used in meditation and visualization practices as a way of connecting with the divine and attaining a higher level of understanding of the universe.\nOverall, sacred geometry is an ancient and cross-cultural tradition that has been used for thousands of years to express spiritual and philosophical ideas, and to create aesthetically pleasing structures and designs.\nBasic shaped ans principles # The basic shapes and principles of sacred geometry include:\nThe Circle: The circle is a symbol of unity, wholeness, and the infinite, representing the cyclical nature of life, the universe, and the divine.\nThe Square: The square represents stability, balance, and the earth.

The idea is that these shapes and patterns reflect the underlying structure and principles of the universe, and that they can be used to express spiritual and philosophical ideas, as well as to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing designs.\nIn historical architecture # Many historical buildings and structures have been designed with sacred geometry principles incorporated into their design. Some examples include:\nThe Parthenon, Athens, Greece: The Parthenon, built in the 5th century BCE, is considered a prime example of the use of sacred geometry in ancient Greek architecture. The proportions and measurements of the temple, as well as its intricate decorations, are said to be based on the golden ratio and other sacred geometric principles.\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt: The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE, is one of the most famous examples of sacred geometry in ancient architecture. The pyramid\u0026rsquo;s shape and proportions, as well as its internal chambers and passageways, are said to be based on sacred geometric principles and to have spiritual significance.\nStonehenge, England: Stonehenge, built between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in prehistoric architecture. The circular arrangement of the stones and the use of geometric patterns and shapes have been seen as expressions of spiritual and astronomical beliefs.\nChartres Cathedral, France: Chartres Cathedral, built in the 12th and 13th centuries, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in medieval architecture. The cathedral\u0026rsquo;s design, with its intricate stained glass windows and elaborate geometric patterns, is said to embody spiritual and cosmic principles.\nHagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey: Hagia Sophia, built in the 6th century CE, is an example of the use of sacred geometry in Byzantine architecture. The dome of the cathedral is said to embody sacred geometric principles, and the intricate geometric patterns in its mosaics and decorations are expressions of spiritual ideas.\nThese are just a few examples of the many historical buildings and structures that have incorporated sacred geometry into their design. The use of sacred geometry can be found in a wide range of architectural styles and traditions, from ancient to modern times, and reflects the belief in the spiritual significance of geometric shapes and patterns.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Ancient Builders External links # Sacred Geometry | Wikipedia "},{"id":"154","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%8D%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0/","title":"–°–∏–º–≤–æ–ª –ë–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –†–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º–∞","description":"–†–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º, –Ω–æ–≤–æ–µ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –∫ —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É–∑—Å–∫–æ–º—É —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫—É, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è–≤–Ω–æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–ª –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è –≤–Ω–µ–∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –Ø—Ö–≤–µ, –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–æ–π —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª, –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–µ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –°–≤–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞ - –¥–≤–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∞ —Å –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏–º–∏ –¥–≤–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –∞—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∞ –ë–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –°–∞–º–∞ –ë–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–º –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –≠—Ç–∏ –¥–≤–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –∞—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∞ - –±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É–µ–º–∞—è –°–≤–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–æ–π, –∏ –±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É–µ–º–∞—è –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–æ–π –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞.","content":"–í–∏–∑—É–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è # –†–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç—ã –≤–∏–∑—É–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –°–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∞ –ë–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –†–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º–∞.\n–°–º. —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ # –í–∏–∫–∏ ‚Ä∫ –ë–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –í–∏–∫–∏ ‚Ä∫ –†–∞—ç–ª–∏–∑–º –í–∏–∫–∏ ‚Ä∫ –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–∞ –í–∏–∫–∏ ‚Ä∫ –°–≤–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ "},{"id":"155","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/","title":"–°–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∞","description":"–°–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∞ ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Å–ª—å –≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω–µ, —Å–±–æ—Ä–∫–µ –∏ —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ–∑–µ –ø–æ–ª–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏—Ö —Å–µ–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–æ–≤. –û–Ω –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤ —Å–µ–±—è —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –î–ù–ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏–º–∏—Ç–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º—ã –∏–ª–∏ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –æ—Ç –Ω–∏—Ö. –°–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞, —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–∞–∫ —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ö—Ä–æ–º–æ—Å–æ–º—ã –∏–ª–∏ —Ü–µ–ª—ã–µ —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≥–µ–Ω–æ–º—ã, –¥–ª—è –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ñ—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –±–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤, –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏—è –º–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞ –≥–µ–Ω–æ–≤, –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ–≥–æ –¥–ª—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–æ–≤ —Å –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–º–∏ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞–º–∏. –û–Ω –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–µ—Ç –≤ —Å–µ–±—è —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ –¥–ª—è –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –µ—é.","content":"Relationship with synthetic biology # Synthetic genomics and synthetic biology are closely related fields, but there are subtle differences between the two:\nSynthetic genomics: Synthetic genomics primarily focuses on the design, assembly, and synthesis of complete genomes or large segments of genomes. It involves the creation of artificial DNA sequences that mimic or differ from existing natural genomes. Synthetic genomics often aims to understand the minimal set of genes necessary for a living organism\u0026rsquo;s functioning and can involve the creation of synthetic chromosomes or even entire synthetic genomes. It is a branch of genetic engineering that deals specifically with the construction of genetic material.\nSynthetic biology: Synthetic biology, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of activities and approaches. It involves the application of engineering principles to design and construct biological systems or components with novel functions. Synthetic biology encompasses the design and engineering of genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, proteins, and other biological modules to create new organisms or modify existing ones. It integrates various disciplines such as biology, genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to create synthetic biological systems that can perform specific tasks or exhibit desired traits.\nSynthetic genomics focuses on the creation of artificial genomes or large segments of genomes, while synthetic biology encompasses a wider range of activities, including the design and construction of genetic circuits, proteins, and other biological components, to create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic genomics can be considered a subset of synthetic biology that specifically deals with the construction of genetic material.\nA branch of synthetic biology # Synthetic genomics is a branch of synthetic biology that involves the design and construction of complete genomes from scratch, which can then be used to create entirely new organisms or significantly modify existing ones. This scientific discipline is characterized by the scale of its ambition: while other areas of genetic engineering might involve altering or adding a few genes, synthetic genomics aspires to construct and manipulate entire genomes.\nThe foundation of synthetic genomics lies in the understanding and manipulation of DNA, the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions for life. Scientists have been reading DNA for decades, in the sense of sequencing genomes to determine their content. The advent of synthetic genomics, however, has introduced the capacity to write DNA, to design and construct DNA sequences with desired characteristics. This capacity is grounded in advances in technologies for artificial gene synthesis and genome assembly.\nArtifical gene synthesis # Artificial gene synthesis refers to the laboratory process of creating DNA molecules from nucleotide building blocks. This process, which is also used in other areas of genetic engineering, is carried out using automated machines called DNA synthesizers. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, this technology allows the synthesis of DNA molecules up to a few thousand base pairs in length.\nCreating an entire genome, however, often requires millions or even billions of base pairs, far beyond the reach of current gene synthesis technology. To overcome this limitation, synthetic genomics relies on methods for assembling smaller pieces of synthetic DNA into larger ones. These methods, which include techniques such as Gibson assembly and yeast homologous recombination, can join multiple pieces of DNA together in a specific order to create a larger DNA molecule.\nAchievements # Severals achievements have already been recorded in the field of synthetic genomics.\nCreation of the first synthetic cell # One of the landmark achievements in synthetic genomics was the creation of the first synthetic cell by scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2010. This project involved the design and synthesis of a bacterial genome based on the sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides. The synthetic genome was then transplanted into a recipient cell of a different species, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing its genome and effectively converting the cell into the synthetic species. This represented the first creation of a cell controlled entirely by a synthetic genome.\nCreation of the first entirely computer-made bacterial genome # In April 2019, a team of researchers from ETH Zurich made a significant stride in synthetic genomics, announcing the creation of the world\u0026rsquo;s first bacterial genome constructed entirely by a computer. The synthetic organism was named Caulobacter ethensis-2.0, in recognition of the team\u0026rsquo;s institution and the original bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, from which the synthetic genome was derived.\nCaulobacter crescentus is a well-studied bacterium known for its asymmetric cell division and is a model organism for cellular biology. By leveraging a deep understanding of the natural bacterium, the researchers were able to design a significantly simplified version of its genome on the computer. This synthetic genome incorporated only the genes deemed essential for life, a subset of the total genes found in the natural bacterium.\nOnce the genome design was complete, the sequence was synthesized in the laboratory. This process involved the chemical construction of the DNA molecule corresponding to the designed sequence. Due to the size of the genome, it was synthesized in pieces and then assembled into the complete genome.\nAt the time of their announcement, the scientists had not yet created a viable bacterium with the synthetic genome. The synthesizing of the genome was completed, but the researchers were still in the process of transplanting the synthetic genome into a bacterial cell, a complex and delicate process.\nThe creation of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 represents a significant advance in synthetic genomics. By designing and constructing a complete bacterial genome, the ETH Zurich team brought the field a step closer to the creation of entirely synthetic organisms. The eventual achievement of a viable Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 would offer a powerful new tool for studying the fundamentals of life and could pave the way for custom-built synthetic organisms with wide-ranging applications. However, this breakthrough also emphasizes the ethical and safety considerations that must be addressed as the field of synthetic genomics continues to advance.\nApplications # The potential applications of synthetic genomics are vast. In theory, organisms could be custom-built to perform specific tasks, such as producing biofuels, recycling waste, or producing pharmaceuticals. In addition, synthetic genomics could provide a powerful tool for studying fundamental questions in biology, such as the minimal set of genes required for life.\nOutlook # Synthetic genomics could play a crucial role in creating life on another planet, as it provides the necessary tools for designing and creating entirely new life forms from scratch. This potential capability becomes increasingly relevant when considering life in a pan-tropic context, meaning adapting organisms to survive and thrive in various, and possibly extreme, environmental conditions as they might be found on other planets.\nAt its core, synthetic genomics revolves around understanding, designing, and manipulating entire genomes. This not only includes the ability to make minor alterations to existing organisms but also the potential to create novel organisms tailor-made for specific environments.\nWhen considering life on another planet, the conditions could be drastically different from those on Earth, encompassing variations in temperature, gravity, atmospheric composition, radiation levels, and availability of water and other necessary elements. These are conditions under which Earth life may not survive or function efficiently. Synthetic genomics could provide a solution by enabling the creation of life forms designed specifically for these conditions.\nFor instance, genes associated with radiation resistance, extreme temperature tolerance, or metabolic pathways that can utilize non-Earth like biochemistry could be included in the design of a synthetic genome. These synthetic organisms could be created and tested in simulated extraterrestrial environments here on Earth before any interplanetary missions.\nSuch an endeavor is aligned with the narrative of the Elohim as described in the Ra√´lian tradition, wherein these advanced beings had supposedly reached a point of technological sophistication that allowed them to create life. If the narrative is to be believed, the Elohim would likely have used something akin to synthetic genomics, combined with other advanced technologies, to create organisms adapted to the specific conditions of Earth, thereby seeding life here.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genetic engineering Wiki ‚Ä∫ Life engineering Wiki ‚Ä∫ Synthetic biology External links # Synthetic genomics | Wikipedia "},{"id":"156","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2/","title":"–°–º–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤","description":"–°–º–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤, –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∞—è —Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–π, –ø—Ä–∏—à–µ–¥—à–∏—Ö –Ω–∞ —Å–º–µ–Ω—É –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–º—É –ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø—É, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å—É –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ –∏ –æ–±–µ–∑–≤—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å —ç—Ç–∏ —É—Å–∏–ª–∏—è. –ú–µ—Ä–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏–µ –ø–æ –∑–∞–º–µ—à–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –≤ –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ –≤—Å–µ–º—É –∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–º—É —à–∞—Ä—É —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —É–∂–µ –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –∏—Ö –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å.","content":"The Confusion of Tongues is an event described in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. According to the story, the people referred to in the Bible were initially of one language and lived together in harmony. However, they decided to build a great tower that would reach the heavens, which is called the Tower of Babel. The Elohim saw this as a challenge to their authority and decided to confuse their language, making it impossible for them to understand each other. This caused the people to be scattered across the known world, unable to work together on their tower.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Yahweh mentions the confusion of tongues and says the following about what happened:\nThey were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.\nGo to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u0026rsquo;s speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\n‚Äî Genesis 11: 7-8.1\nSo they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.\nThis passage is referring to the story of the Tower of Babel in the book of Genesis in the Bible. The Elohim, the creators, who are observing the Earth, decide to confound the language of the people who were building space-travelling technology to reach the heavens. As a result, the people were scattered across the Earth and could no longer communicate with each other.\nThe author of the passage suggests that the creators took this action to prevent the people from becoming too powerful and to slow down their scientific progress. The creators took the Jews with the most scientific knowledge and scattered them among primitive tribes in countries where they could not be understood due to language barriers.

They make decisions and hold authority over the universe and human affairs. They are invoked or worshipped for their wisdom and assistance. In some traditions, they represent a pantheon of gods, while in others, they are depicted as an assembly of celestial beings surrounding a supreme deity.\nIn the Hebrew account # In the Bible, there are various accounts of Yahweh presiding over a grand assembly of Heavenly Hosts, which some interpret as instances of a Divine Council. These descriptions in the Old Testament indicate that the concept of a divine assembly was similar to those found in Mesopotamian and Canaanite cultures. However, it is important to note that the identities of the assembly members are less explicit compared to polytheistic descriptions, as Israelite writers aimed to emphasize the distinctiveness and supremacy of their Godhead, Yahweh.\nPsalm 82 presents a verse stating that God, referred to in the plural Elohim (Hebrew: ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù), stands in the divine assembly (Hebrew: ◊ë÷∑÷º◊¢÷≤◊ì÷∑◊™-◊ê÷µ◊ú, ‚ÄòƒÉ·∏èa·πØ-‚Äô√™l)1 and judges among the gods, again referred to in the plural Elohim. The plurality of this divine assemlby is known among Biblical scholars of all walks and is source of great debates, specifically how the plural \u0026ldquo;elohim\u0026rdquo; has to be interpreted considering that monotheism is taken for granted. Some of them argue that both instances refer to Yahweh, while others suggest that the God of Israel governs over a divine assembly of other gods or angels. Different translations of this passage render it as \u0026ldquo;God stands in the congregation of the mighty to judge the heart as God\u0026rdquo; (elohim) or \u0026ldquo;in the midst of gods\u0026rdquo; (beqerev elohim). Later in the same psalm, the term plural \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo;, again actually elohim in the Hebrew source text, is used, stating \u0026ldquo;I have said, \u0026lsquo;You are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Psalm 82:6). Some versions substitute \u0026ldquo;gods\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;godlike beings,\u0026rdquo; but the word employed is still elohim/elohiym. This passage is referenced in the New Testament in John 10:34.\nIn the Books of Kings (1 Kings 22:19), the prophet Micaiah has a vision of Yahweh seated among \u0026ldquo;the whole host of heaven\u0026rdquo;, with beings standing on His right and left. When Micaiah seeks someone to entice Ahab and a \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; (Hebrew: ◊®◊ï÷º◊ó÷∑, r√∫akh)2 volunteers. This has been interpreted as an illustration of a divine council where the \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; is a member of said council.3\nThe initial chapters of the Book of Job describe the \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; assembling in the presence of Yahweh. The term \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; and its relation to the \u0026ldquo;multitudes of heaven\u0026rdquo; defy precise interpretation. Some view this assembly as another instance of a divine council, while others translate \u0026ldquo;Sons of God\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;angels,\u0026rdquo; suggesting that it does not represent a divine council since angels are creations of God and not deities.\nThe role of the divine assembly as a conceptual backdrop in Hebrew prophecy is evident in two descriptions of prophetic involvement in the heavenly council. In 1 Kings 22:19‚Äì23, Micaiah is permitted to witness the Elohim in action during a celestial decision regarding Ahab\u0026rsquo;s fate. Isaiah 6 portrays a situation where the prophet assumes the role of the messenger of the assembly, commissioned by Yahweh. These depictions underscore the significance of the conceptual background of prophetic authority.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Ra√´lism, Yahweh is explicitely identified as the president of the Council of the Eternals governing the Elohim‚Äôs planet and therefore an individual of flesh and blood among the Elohimian civilization.\nAccording to the second book Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet, Chapter Meeting the Ancient Prophets, Yahweh himself explains that the Council of the Eternals live in a planet dedicated for that purpose:\nIn my first message I told you of a residence located on our planet where people from Earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell.\nAmong those people are Jesus, Moses, Elijah and so on. This residence is, in fact, very large, since it is an entire planet where the members of the Council of the Eternals live as well. My name is Yahweh, and I am the president of that Council of the Eternals.\nThere are currently 8,400 people from Earth living on the planet where we are at this moment. They are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of open-mindedness towards the infinite, or who enabled humanity on Earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries, their writings, their ways of organizing society and their exemplary acts of fraternity, love or selflessness.\nAlongside them live the 700 Elohim members of the Council of the Eternals.4\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe passage states that there is a residence on another planet where people from Earth can live due to a scientific secret of eternity based on a single cell.

It is about two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, that were said to have been located in the region of the Dead Sea.\nAccording to the story, the cities were known for their great wickedness and sin. God sent two angels to visit the city of Sodom to see if the reports of its wickedness were true. When the people of Sodom demanded that the angels be handed over to them so they could be sexually abused, the angels blinded the people and warned Lot, a righteous man who lived in the city, to flee with his family.\nGod then destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone, raining down on the cities from the sky, killing all the people who lived there. Only Lot and his two daughters escaped the destruction.\nThe story of Sodom and Gomorrah has been interpreted in various ways over the centuries, with some viewing it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of sin and disobedience, while others see it as a story about God\u0026rsquo;s wrath and justice. It has also been used to justify the condemnation of homosexuality, and is still a source of debate and interpretation today.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Second Chapter, Truth, Yahweh mentions Sodom and Gomorrah and explains what happened with following words:\nBut among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them. [\u0026hellip;] They warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:\nUp, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city.\n‚Äî Genesis 19: 14.\nAs the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.\nEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain.\n‚Äî Genesis 19: 17.\nAnd the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:\nThen Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n‚Äî Genesis 19: 24-26.\nAs you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.\nThe group of humans who had been dispersed on Earth, harbored a desire for vengeance against those who tried to destroy them. They managed to salvage a few scientific secrets and prepared an expedition to punish their oppressors. They warned the peaceful people to leave Sodom and Gomorrah, as they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion. The peaceful people did not realize the implications of an atomic explosion and were in no hurry to leave the town. The bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities were overthrown, and all the inhabitants of the cities were killed. Burns caused by the explosion made people look like salt statues, which is what happened to the wife of Lot who looked back during her escape.

Close encounters can range from simply observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky to experiencing physical contact with an alien being. The idea of close encounters has been a subject of fascination for many people, particularly those interested in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\nOne example of a close encounter is the event in 1460 BC when the Nubians were defeated by what was described as a \u0026ldquo;falling star\u0026rdquo;. While it is possible that this could have been a natural phenomenon such as a meteor, some have suggested that it could have been a visitation from extraterrestrial beings. Similarly, the biblical stories of the abduction of Elijah and Ezekiel have been interpreted by some as close encounters, with the descriptions of strange flying vehicles and beams of light being cited as evidence.\nAnother example of a close encounter is the story of Akhenaton\u0026rsquo;s flying disk, which is said to have been seen by the pharaoh Akhenaton in ancient Egypt. According to the story, Akhenaton witnessed a disk-shaped object that emitted a bright light and had the ability to hover in the air. Some have suggested that this was a close encounter with an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\nWhile close encounters are often dismissed as mere legends or hoaxes, there are many reported cases of such events that remain unexplained. Witnesses to these events often report experiencing intense fear or awe, as well as a sense of profound spiritual or mystical significance.\nIn some cases, close encounters have been associated with alleged sightings of UFOs or other unidentified flying objects. These sightings have been reported all over the world, and many have been captured on video or in photographs. However, the scientific community generally remains skeptical of the existence of extraterrestrial life, and most sightings of UFOs are attributed to natural phenomena or human-made objects such as aircraft or weather balloons.\nDespite this skepticism, the idea of close encounters remains a subject of fascination for many people. Whether they are the result of actual visitations from extraterrestrial beings or simply the products of human imagination, stories of close encounters continue to capture the imagination and inspire wonder and curiosity about the mysteries of the universe.\nList of close encounters # The following table shows the majority of close encounters that have been reported since antiquity:\nEncounter Year Location Description A \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo;

They represent the fundamental building blocks of myths, and can be observed in stories from diverse regions and times. These mythemes can range from the concept of a hero‚Äôs journey to the use of certain animals to represent specific qualities or ideas.\nOne example of a prominent mythological motif is the Creation myth, which explains the origins of the world, the universe, and human life. Creation myths can take many forms and can be found in many cultures, such as the Babylonian Enuma Elish or the Judeo-Christian Genesis. These myths often involve a supreme being or beings that create the world and all life within it through supernatural means, such as speaking it into existence or molding it out of clay.\nAnother well-known mythological motif is the flood myth, which can also be found in many cultures and traditions. This motif typically involves a catastrophic flood that destroys most of the world, and often leads to the creation of a new world or the rebirth of humanity. Examples of flood myths can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu story of Manu, and the biblical story of Noah and the ark.\nOne of the most fascinating mythological motifs is that of the creators from the sky, or from above. These stories involve the arrival of beings from another world who impart knowledge, technology, or culture to humans. These creators are often depicted as powerful, advanced beings with god-like abilities, and can be found in myths from various cultures, such as the Sumerian Anunnaki, the Greek Titans, or the Hindu Devas. The stories of the creators from the sky have led many to speculate that they were actually extraterrestrial beings, who came to Earth and interacted with humans in the distant past.\nList of mythemes and mythological motifs # The following table shows the majority of well-established, well-known mythemes and mythological motifs that exhibit mythological readings that can be explained within the Wheel of Heaven working hypothesis:\nMotif Motif-Index Myth(s) Reading Serpent-slaying battle Zeus vs. Typhon (Greek) Thor vs. J√∂rmungandr (Norse) Ba øal vs. Yam (Canaanite) Marduk vs. Tiamat (Babylonian) Ra vs. Apep (Egyptian) Quetzalcoatl vs. Cipactli (Aztec) Yu the Great vs. Xiangliu or Gong Gong (Chinese) Benzaiten vs. Gozuryu (Japanese Buddhism) Lac Long Quan vs. Ngu Tinh (Vietnamese mythology) Victory over the Elohimian Serpent (Leviathan) Creation of man from clay Genesis 2:7 (Judeo-Christian) Qur\u0026rsquo;an 23:12 (Islamic) Enki and Enlil (Sumerian) Khnum (Egyptian) Genetic engineering of mankind with basic source chemicals Creation myth Creator from above A21 Flood myth A10XX Primordial chaos Sky father A210 Theft of fire A1415 Titanomachy See also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Mytheme External links # Motif-Index of Folk Literature | Wikipedia "},{"id":"161","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%B8-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B9/","title":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤ –∏ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–π","description":"–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤ –∏ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–π. –ú–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º –≤—Å–µ, —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º–∏ –ø–æ–¥–ª–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –º–µ–∂–¥—É –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏ (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù) –∏ –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏ –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ. –≠—Ç–∏ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç –∫ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã–º –ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è–º –∏ —É—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–º —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è–º, —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º –æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –≤ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ –∏—Å—á–µ—Ä–ø—ã–≤–∞—é—â–∏–º –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥–æ–º –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏–æ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–π, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤–µ–¥—É—Ç –∫ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è–º.","content":"There are several major world religions, each with their own unique beliefs and practices.

It seeks to understand common themes, motifs, and elements across cultures and how they evolve over time. By comparing myths from different cultures, scholars can gain insights into the cultural, historical, and psychological aspects of those cultures. This approach has been used to shed light on the origin of myths, the spread of religious and cultural ideas, and the evolution of human thought and beliefs. Some of the most famous examples of comparative mythology include the similarities between the gods of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, tales and songs in European folklore, and the myths of creation found in many cultures.\nHamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill # Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechends is considered a milestone in comparative mythology because it presents a novel approach to the study of myths and their origins. The book argues that ancient myths from cultures around the world contain encoded astronomical and scientific knowledge that has been passed down through generations. The authors propose that this knowledge was encoded in myths as a way of preserving it, despite the lack of written records in many early cultures. By comparing and decoding myths from different cultures, the authors claim that they can uncover this ancient knowledge and better understand the worldviews of ancient cultures. Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Mill has been influential in the field of comparative mythology and has been widely cited as an important work in the study of the interconnections between mythology and science.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Mytheme External links # Comparative Mythology | Wikipedia Comparative Mythology | Art \u0026amp;amp; Popular Culture Encyclopedia Mythology | World History Encyclopedia "},{"id":"164","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5/","title":"–¢–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ","description":"–¢–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ , –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫ —ç–∫–∑–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã, —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞–∫ –∞—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–∞ –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —É–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–π –≥—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤. –¢–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –±—ã–ª –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∞–º–∏ –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∞ –ë—ã—Ç–∏—è –ø–æ –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –ó–µ–º–ª—è –≤ –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞–µ–º—É—é.","content":"Terraforming is the process of changing the conditions on a planet, moon, or other celestial body to make it more like Earth so that humans (and possibly other Earth life) can live there.

The process would involve changing a planet\u0026rsquo;s temperature, atmosphere, topography, and ecology to be similar to those of Earth. For example, if we wanted to terraform Mars, we might find ways to warm the planet, add oxygen to its atmosphere, and introduce water and life forms. It\u0026rsquo;s like making a new Earth on a different planet. In simpler terms, terraforming is like setting up a new home on a different planet by making it look and feel like Earth.

It encompasses a wide range of cultural expressions, from religious rituals and moral codes to artistic styles and social norms. Traditions are often seen as a way of connecting people with their cultural heritage and preserving their collective identity and history.\nOver the centuries, many different traditions have developed in different parts of the world. For example, some traditions are associated with particular religious beliefs, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, while others are based on cultural practices, such as the traditions of indigenous peoples or the festivals and customs of various ethnic groups.\nHermetic tradition # The Tradition, as referred to by Hermetic philosophy or more specifically Hermeticism, is the notion that a body of knowledge and wisdom has been preserved over millenia which origins date back to ancient Greece and Egypt. It\u0026rsquo;s based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who was said to be the author of a set of scriptures known as the Corpus Hermeticum. The Tradition encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, including alchemy, astrology, magic, and theurgy, and is considered by some to be a remnant of ancient scientific and technological knowledge.\nOne of the key components of The Tradition is astrology, which was considered a science in ancient times and played a significant role in the development of astronomy. The astrologers of The Tradition believed that the positions and movements of celestial bodies had a direct influence on human affairs and that the study of the stars could reveal secrets about the universe and the nature of reality.\nAccording to Jean Sendy # Jean Sendy, a French author who wrote on the subject of ancient astronauts, translates Elohim as the \u0026ldquo;gods from the sky\u0026rdquo; or the Celestials. He argues that the term Elohim in the Hebrew Bible refers to a group of beings that were not strictly divine, but rather a class of powerful, advanced beings from the celestial sky who interacted with humanity.\nIn Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, Sendy identifies Medievalism as a key moment where the inherited Tradition flourished:\nMedievalists are called medievalists because their view, inherited from the Tradition of Moses, reached its apogee in the Middle Ages. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, humanists, proud of their fragmentary sciences, jeered at medieval beliefs. Medievalists have always believed in the possibility of transmuting metals, making flying machines, and even going to the moon. They were positively ridiculous in the nineteenth century, when the absurdity of their wild notions was clearly demonstrated. Today, cJf course, peing a medievalist, I feel more at ease than a humanist\u0026hellip;\nLater on in the same book, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s thought gets developed even further:\nMedievalists have always believed in space travel, because they have never doubted the Tradition that claims to be the heritage of the Celestials and promises that men will first conquer the moon, then the universe of the gods their cousins.\nAt the end of Chapter 10 of the same book, Sendy dares to make a prediction that his ideas would either be confirmed or invalidated by future discoveries:\nAbove the smug nineteenth century, our twentieth century is joining the Middle Ages, which were directly connected with the Biblical Tradition. This book is a reading ef that Tradition in the light ef today\u0026rsquo;s scientific knewledge, and it will be either confirmed er invalidated by the knowledge and discoveries of tomerrow.\nEncoded precessional knowledge # One of the main ideas put forward by Jean Sendy in virtually all of his work is the notion that the Zodiacal symbolism is strongly associated with the progression of precession-induced eras or so-called world ages. In his book Those Gods Who Made Heaven \u0026amp; Earth, he explains in a lengthy Chatper 16 how the precession is responsible for a shifting of the night sky and the constellation on the zodiacal plane. At the end of that chatper, he hints that this knowledge has been a core tenet of a millenia-long tradition:\nI have presented four main points in support of my thesis:\nThe priests of ancient Egypt, Judaism and Christianity have all claimed to be the heirs of a Tradition that came \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo;. The persistence with which the Bull-Ram-Fish zodiacal symbolism has been maintained down to the present shows that a single Tradition is involved. The physical transmission of knowledge that came \u0026ldquo;from the sky\u0026rdquo; was attributed by the Egyptian priests to \u0026ldquo;gods,\u0026rdquo; by the Jews to \u0026ldquo;Elohim,\u0026rdquo; by the Christian Tradition to \u0026ldquo;angels.\u0026rdquo; (And the Byzantine theologians maintained that those \u0026ldquo;angels\u0026rdquo; had sexes.) The concrete reality of those gods-Elohim-angels is the most rational explanation of the knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes indicated by the zodiacal symbolism of the three related religions. Of all the versions of the Myth, only the one contained in the Bible has been transmitted to us by a line of priests and theologians from whom, since Moses, changing as much as a single letter of the text has always been an abominable crime.\nA Gentleman\u0026rsquo;s Joyous Esotericism # In a seminal paper of the same title, Stefano Bigliardi fleshes out an accurate portrayal of Jean Sendy. As the notion of an inherited Tradition is a central key aspect of Sendy\u0026rsquo;s thought, in the seminal paper, the Tradition is introduced through the references to Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s book Les cahiers de cours de Mo√Øse (French for Moses\u0026rsquo; course notebooks) as follows:\nSendy‚Äôs hypothesis is that Moses was the custodian of an ancestral ‚ÄúTradition.‚Äù The Tradition involves an historical and a prophetic element. The history is that of the arrival on earth of extra-terrestrial cosmonauts, which Sendy calls Theosites (their home planet being Theos, p. 201). The Book of Genesis is, therefore, an account of their arrival and of their manipulation of humans, as well as the Earth‚Äôs environment, over a long period of time. Each ‚Äúday‚Äù in Genesis can be understood as a specific phase in the Theosites‚Äô presence on our planet, and each phase corresponds, in turn, to the sun‚Äôs different positions at dawn, with reference to the constellations of the horoscope. These positions shift over the millennia (a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, pp. 33-44). The prophetical part of the Tradition, which, likewise, makes reference to the precession, hints at humanity‚Äôs spiritual and technological development after the Theosites left our planet.\nBigliardi mentions Sendy\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the Tradition further on:\nConcerning the prophetic part of the Tradition, according to Sendy, humanity has entered the Age of Aquarius, in which its development is comparable to that of the Theosites.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAll those civilizations that were able to conserve the Tradition flourished, according to Sendy, whereas the remaining ones went astray.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTo begin with, Catholicism is seen by Sendy as a repository of Tradition, and hence as a vessel of correct knowledge and orientation for humanity in scientific, as well as ethical, matters. Sendy remarks that the Jesuits were also custodians of the Tradition and they were perfectly aware, therefore, that Columbus would reach America and not the Indies (pp. 300-301).\nAccording to Jean Sendy # In his Coming of the Gods, Jean Sendy writes the following about the Tradition and himself being a Medievalist:\nDid the assumption of mediocrity, which von Hoerner reproaches the Greeks for not having formulated and applied, constitute the basis of the thought of the First Civilizations, the thought that bas been transmitted since the dawn of historic times by what is called the Tradition? In other words, did \u0026ldquo;the Ancients\u0026rdquo; think more accurately than \u0026ldquo;the Greeks?\u0026rsquo;¬∑ That is exactly what men of the Middle Ages (of whom I am one) have always repeated to Renaissance humanists, reproaching them for their determination to replace the thought of the Ancients with neo-Greek thought.\nSendy explores the idea of the Tradition and questions whether the assumption of mediocrity, which von Hoerner criticized the Greeks for not having, was actually the basis of thought for the First Civilizations. Sendy suggests that the thought of the Ancients, as transmitted through the Tradition, may have been more accurate than the thought of the Greeks. He also notes that men of the Middle Ages, including himself, have traditionally held this view and have criticized Renaissance humanists for replacing ancient thought with neo-Greek thought. That\u0026rsquo;s why he considers himself a Medievalist, because he recognizes the Tradition to be preserving a body of knowledge that was available to the Ancients. This body of knowledge assumes to know who these Gods of Old were. These Gods that came from the Skies and where made of blood and flesh just like us.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Bible Wiki ‚Ä∫ The Truth Wiki ‚Ä∫ Kabbalah External links # Perennial philosophy | Wikipedia Tradition | Wikipedia "},{"id":"166","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC/","title":"–¢—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–π —Ö—Ä–∞–º","description":"–¢—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–π –•—Ä–∞–º, —Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Ç—å –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ê–ø–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–ø—Å–∏—Å–∞.","content":"The Third Temple refers to a place of worship that is prophesied to be built in Jerusalem in Jewish eschatology. According to some interpretations of the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Jewish texts, the Third Temple will replace the Second Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The rebuilding of the Third Temple is seen as a significant event in the Messianic age and is eagerly awaited by some Jews. There is currently no Third Temple in existence, and the exact nature and purpose of the Third Temple remains a matter of debate and speculation among scholars and religious leaders.\nThe rebuilding of the Third Temple remains a topic of religious and political discussion, but there has been no serious effort to begin construction. The Temple Mount, the site where the First and Second Temples were located, is currently occupied by the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, and the political and religious issues surrounding the site make it unlikely that a Third Temple will be built in the near future. Some ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups advocate for the rebuilding of the Third Temple, but their views are not representative of the wider Jewish community and face opposition from other religious and political groups.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # In Ra√´lism, the Third Temple temple is equated with a dedicated residence to the Elohim which would also act as an embassy.\nAccording to the Book Which Tells The Truth, Sixth Chapter \u0026ldquo;The New Commandments\u0026rdquo;, Section \u0026ldquo;Your Mission\u0026rdquo;, Yahweh asks Ra√´l and his followers to built a residence that serves as an embassy between the People of the Earth and the Elohim:\nHave a residence built in a pleasant country with a mild climate, with seven rooms always ready to receive guests, each with a separate bathroom, a conference room able to accommodate twenty-one people, a swimming pool and a dining room capable of seating twenty-one people.\nThis residence should be constructed in the middle of a park and should be protected from curious onlookers. The park should be entirely surrounded by walls to prevent anyone from seeing the residence and the swimming pool.\nThe residence should be situated at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the walls around the park. It will have a maximum of two stories and should be further screened from view by an inner barrier of trees and bushes. Install two entrances in the surrounding wall, one to the south and another on the northern side.\nThe residence will also have two entrances. There will be a terrace on the roof where a spacecraft of twelve meters in diameter may land. Access from that terrace to the interior is essential.\nThe air space above and around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance.\nYou will try to ensure that the area where this residence is built -if possible larger than stipulated here- is treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located, by virtue of it being our embassy on Earth.\nThe passage outlines instructions for the construction of a residence in a pleasant country with a mild climate, to be used as an embassy on Earth for extraterrestrial beings. The residence should have seven rooms with separate bathrooms, a conference room for 21 people, a swimming pool, and a dining room for 21 people. It should be situated in the middle of a park surrounded by walls, at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the park walls. The residence will have two entrances and will be screened by trees and bushes. The air space around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance. The area around the residence should be treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located.\nIn Ra√´lian beliefs, the third temple refers to the embassy that the Elohim, the extraterrestrial creators, asked to be built on Earth in accordance with their plan. They believe that the embassy is the symbol of the third temple, which is a place of worship for those who believe in the message of the Elohim.\nAccording to their beliefs, the first temple was built by King Solomon in Jerusalem and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, while the second temple was rebuilt after the Babylonian exile and destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. They see the construction of the embassy as the fulfillment of the prophecy in the Bible that the third temple will be built by the Messiah.\nThe embassy is seen as the place where the Elohim will meet with their ambassadors and provide them with guidance and knowledge. The Ra√´lians see the embassy as a place of peace and education, where the Elohim\u0026rsquo;s message of love, peace, and respect for life can be shared with the world.\nIn this sense, the embassy can be considered the third temple, as it represents the physical manifestation of the Ra√´lian belief system and their connection to the Elohim. It is a place where their members can come together to worship and learn, and where they can share their beliefs with others in the hopes of promoting a more peaceful and harmonious world.\nThe Ra√´lian Embassy # The Ra√´lian Embassy is a proposed building that is part of the main tenets of the Ra√´lian movement. The Ra√´lian movement is based on the belief that extraterrestrial beings known as Elohim created life on Earth, and that they will return in the future to guide humanity to a new era of peace and harmony. The Ra√´lian Embassy is intended to be a physical representation of the movement\u0026rsquo;s beliefs and values, serving as a hub for the promotion of Ra√´lian ideas and a place for members to gather and worship. The construction of the Ra√´lian Embassy has not yet begun, and it is unclear when or if it will be built.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Abraham Wiki ‚Ä∫ List of prophets and religions External links # Prophet | Wikipedia Prophecy | Britannica Prophecy | Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy "},{"id":"167","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8/","title":"–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è –∫–æ–≥–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –°–µ–Ω–¥–∏","description":"–£—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –°–µ–Ω–¥–∏, –Ω–∞–±–æ—Ä —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤—è–∑–Ω–æ–µ –∏ —Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–∏, –≥–¥–µ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º—ã –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –º–µ–∂–∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω–æ–π —Ü–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –æ—à–∏–±–æ—á–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –∑–∞ –ë–æ–≥–∞.","content":"Logic of the Bible # Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Coming of the Gods\u0026rdquo; is a book published in 1970 that explores the possibility of ancient astronauts having visited Earth in the past and influencing human civilization. Sendy argues that various ancient myths and religious traditions can be interpreted as evidence of extraterrestrial contact, and that this contact may have had a profound impact on the development of human culture\nIn this book, Sendy writes the following about what conditions need to be met in order to introduce his exegetical reading onto the Bible:\nTo make the Biblical text appear with the relief and coherence of a hologram, there are four conditions to be met: first, you must know the Bible; second, you must know the possibilities and limitations of astronautics within the framework of today\u0026rsquo;s physics; third, you must have some clear and recent knowledge, even if it is elementary, of biology, prehistory, history, and evolution; and fourth, you must reject any \u0026ldquo;explanation by the inexplicable\u0026rdquo;, that is, any intrusion of the supernatural.\nThere is also a fifth condition, an implicit one: you must have accepted the assumption of a universe intelligible to human reason.\n‚Äî page 182\nIn order to better understand the Biblical text, according to Jean Sendy, there are four key conditions that must be met: 1) knowledge of the Bible, 2) knowledge of astronautics within the context of today\u0026rsquo;s physics, 3) some knowledge of biology, prehistory, history, and evolution, and 4) rejection of supernatural explanations. Additionally, an implicit fifth condition is the acceptance of a universe that is intelligible to human reason.\nThe Five Conditions # The five conditions that Sendy mentions in his book can be seen as a blueprint on how to determine what conditions need to be met to assert the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible:\nFamiliarity with the contents of the Bible Familiarity with the current state of space science, in particular spaceflight Firm comprehension of a variety of scientific notions in biology, prehistory, history and evolution Repudiation of the supernatural Assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason The five conditions that Sendy lays out in his book \u0026ldquo;The Coming of the Gods\u0026rdquo; provide a blueprint for determining what conditions must be met to assert the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible.\nThe first condition, familiarity with the contents of the Bible, suggests that one must have a deep understanding of the text itself in order to interpret it accurately. A method that can be used to get familiar with the original meaning of Biblical scriptures is the so-called Biglino method, an alternative approach to interpreting the Bible, advocating for a literal understanding of its content rather than relying on figurative language or established exegesis.\nThe second condition, familiarity with the current state of space science, highlights the importance of understanding what is possible and impossible within the framework of contemporary physics and astronautics.\nThe third condition, a firm comprehension of a variety of scientific notions in biology, prehistory, history, and evolution, suggests that it is necessary to have a broad range of knowledge across scientific fields in order to interpret the text correctly. This includes an understanding of the historical and evolutionary contexts in which the text was written, as well as the scientific knowledge that has been gained since then.\nThe fourth condition, repudiation of the supernatural, implies that Sendy believed that the text should be interpreted without reference to divine intervention or other supernatural phenomena. This suggests that Sendy sought to interpret the text in a way that was consistent with modern scientific knowledge.\nThe fifth and final condition, an assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason, implies that Sendy believed that the text could be understood using human reasoning and scientific methods. This suggests that Sendy sought to interpret the text in a way that was consistent with contemporary scientific knowledge and rational inquiry.\nTaken together, these conditions suggest that Sendy believed that the hypothesis of ancient astronauts in the Bible could be supported through a careful, scientific analysis of the text that is grounded in a deep understanding of the Bible itself, as well as contemporary scientific knowledge across a broad range of fields.\nRejection of the supernatural # Jean Sendy\u0026rsquo;s assertion that the universe is intelligible to human reason and that the supernatural should be repudiated when interpreting the Bible reflects a philosophical and epistemological perspective that is closely aligned with naturalism and scientific realism.\nNaturalism is a philosophical position that holds that the natural world, including human beings, can be explained by natural causes and laws. It is a rejection of supernatural explanations, and it asserts that the world is knowable through scientific inquiry and human reason. Sendy\u0026rsquo;s rejection of the supernatural in interpreting the Bible is consistent with this naturalistic perspective.\nScientific realism, on the other hand, is an epistemological perspective that holds that scientific theories provide true descriptions of the world, and that the entities and processes posited by science are real and exist independently of our observations of them. This perspective is grounded in the belief that the natural world is orderly and intelligible, and that scientific inquiry can provide a reliable understanding of the world. Sendy\u0026rsquo;s assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason is consistent with this scientific realist perspective.\nThe combination of naturalism and scientific realism reflected in Sendy\u0026rsquo;s work suggests an affinity with a broader philosophical tradition known as empiricism. Empiricism is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of observation and experience in the formation of knowledge, and it holds that knowledge can only be derived from the senses. Empiricists reject metaphysical explanations and seek to ground their understanding of the world in empirical evidence and scientific inquiry.\nIn summary, Sendy\u0026rsquo;s rejection of the supernatural and his assumption that the universe is intelligible to human reason are consistent with a naturalistic and scientific realist perspective that is rooted in the empiricist tradition. These perspectives emphasize the importance of observation and scientific inquiry in the formation of knowledge, and they reject metaphysical or supernatural explanations.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # Ra√´lism shares some similarities with Sendy\u0026rsquo;s perspective, in that it also incorporates a belief in extraterrestrial life and seeks to reconcile science and religion. Another similarity is their shared beliefs about extraterrestrial life and the possibility of alien intervention in human history.\nBoth Sendy and Ra√´lism suggest that extraterrestrial life is possible and that alien beings have visited Earth in the past. They also share an interest in the idea that ancient texts, such as the Bible, may contain references to extraterrestrial life or evidence of alien intervention in human history. More specifically, Ra√´lians view the universe as fundamentally physical and material, and they reject the notion of a supernatural or divine realm.\nIn terms of interpreting the Bible, Ra√´lism takes a naturalistic and scientific approach that is similar in some respects to the approach taken by Jean Sendy. Ra√´lians reject traditional religious interpretations of the Bible and seek to uncover what they believe to be the scientific truths that are hidden within the text. They believe that the Bible contains references to extraterrestrial life and that it is a guide to understanding the nature of the universe and humanity\u0026rsquo;s place within it.\nSee also # Wiki

Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.\nTriangular number # From a mathematical point of view, the number 666 is a triangular number. A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The $nth$ triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with $n$ dots on each side, and is equal to the sum of the $n$ natural numbers from $1$ to $n$. The sequence of triangular numbers, starting with the $0th$ triangular number, contains the following numbers, where $666$ is the $36th$ entry in that sequence:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, \u0026hellip;, 595, 630, 666 \\end{equation*} $$\nThe mathematical way to express the sequence is contained in the following formula:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} T_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \u0026hellip; + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\end{equation*} $$\nIf the formula is solved against $n = 36$, the triangular number formula will result in being equal to $666$:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} T_{36} = \\sum_{k=0}^{36} k = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \u0026hellip; + 36 = \\frac{36(36+1)}{2} = 666 \\end{equation*} $$\nThis is mathematically interesting as triangular numbers are a subtype of figurative numbers.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the Let\u0026rsquo;s Welcome the Extraterrestrials, The Apocalypse of the Final Nuclear Cataclysm, Yahweh explains what has been described in the Book of the Apocalypse which was revealed to John:\nThis final test of Humanity, that is, the choice between self-destruction or the passage into the Golden Age, is the last opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad.\nIf Humanity brilliantly overcomes this last ordeal and succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then men will have proven themselves worthy of receiving our inheritance, since they will have shown they are truly non-violent.\nThe ‚Äúbeast‚Äù, as described further on in the text, is simply the use of nuclear energy for murderous means:\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. Revelation 13: 18.\nIn fact, 666 is the number of human generations which will have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories. The very first humans were created some 13,000 years ago, and a human generation is estimated at an average of 20 years, so if one multiplies 666 by 20, it equals 13,320 years.\nThe generation born at the beginning of the Age of Apocalypse in 1945 of the Christian era, was in fact the 666th since the creation of the first man in a laboratory by the Elohim. This generation coincides precisely with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes at Hiroshima, on August 6th, 1945.\nOnce again, interpretation was not required in order to understand. One had only to read what had been written. 666 was effectively the ‚Äúnumber of Man‚Äù, the number of men who descended from the creation, that is to say, the number of generations.\nIn this passage, it is suggested that the final test of humanity is the choice between self-destruction and the passage into a Golden Age, which is the last opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad. If humanity succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then it will have proven itself worthy of receiving the inheritance. The \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; mentioned in the book of Revelation is interpreted as the use of nuclear energy for murderous purposes. The number 666 is interpreted as the number of human generations that have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories. This generation coincides with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes in Hiroshima in 1945.\nOur take # Considering that the Number of Man may represents a given number of human generations would make it be a duration of time. Depending on what number of years a human generation amounts to, we would get different time durations. A generation is often defined as the average length of time between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring. Therefore, a generation can vary in length depending on factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and cultural norms. 20 years can be considered a sound amount of years it takes for a generation to take place.\nIf we use 20 years for a generation, and the Number of Man being the total amount of human generations, we can determine arithmetically the duration of time the Number of Man ultimately represents with the following amount of years:\n$$ \\begin{equation*} 20y \\times 666 = 13'320y \\end{equation*} $$\nGiven that at Wheel of Heaven, we think in terms of precessional cycles, we would like to determine how many Great Months or World Ages that amount of years represents. A Great Month is defined as the $12th$ of the precessional Great Year which is nominally defined as 25'920 years, rendering a Great Month to be nominally a duration of 2'160 years.\n$$ \\begin{equation*} \\frac{13'320y}{2'160y} = 6.166\u0026hellip; \\end{equation*} $$\nWith these assumptions, we can say the Number of Man amounts to 6 Great Months or in other words half a full precessional cycle. If we now consider Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s statement that the 666th generation has been born around 1945 which coincided with the first man-made explosion of a nuclear weapon, we can determine when the first generation of human beings created during the later stages of Genesis: Exactly 13'320 years before 1945 of the Common Era which would date back to the year 11'375 BCE.\nIt is worth noting that the date of 11'375 BCE holds particular significance as it falls precisely at the point where the Age of Virgo (13'170-11'010 BCE) transitions into the Age of Leo (11'010-8'850 BCE). According to our interpretation of Genesis, this would place the creation of the human species at the very start of the sixth day of creation, immediately following the Age of Virgo and on the cusp of the Age of Leo.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Apocalypse Wiki ‚Ä∫ Genesis Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Aquarius External links # Number of the beast | Wikipedia 666 (New Testament) | Britannica "},{"id":"171","href":"/ru/wiki/%D1%8D%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC/","title":"–≠–¥–µ–º","description":"–≠–¥–µ–º, –æ—Å–æ–±—ã–π —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω –¥–æ–ø–æ—Ç–æ–ø–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞–Ω–≥–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä–∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç–∞, –≥–¥–µ –æ–¥–Ω–∞ –∏–∑ —Å–µ–º–∏ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥ –≠–ª–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –±—ã–ª–∞ –≤–µ—Å—å–º–∞ —Ç–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞ –∏, –∫–∞–∫ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–ª–∞ —Ä–∞–π –Ω–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª–µ. –≠–¥–µ–º—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–∞–¥ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–æ–º—É –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–º—É —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫—É, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç —ç–ª–æ–≥–∏–º–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –≤ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–µ –≠–¥–µ–º–∞.","content":"The Garden of Eden is a significant locale featured prominently in the Biblical narrative of the creation and early history of humanity. Considered a paradise by many, this garden is described in the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Bible. The Garden of Eden symbolizes a primordial utopia, filled with lush vegetation, all forms of life, and the presence of the Elohim.\nThe Garden of Eden is often equated with paradise on earth based on its depiction in religious texts, particularly the Book of Genesis in the Bible. It\u0026rsquo;s described as a place created by God specifically for Adam and Eve, the first human beings, where they lived in harmony with nature, and where scarcity, suffering, and death did not exist. It was a place of peace, abundance, and communion with the creators. Also, the Tree of Life, which granted eternal life, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil were to be found therein.\nEtymology # In Hebrew, the term for the Garden of Eden is ◊í÷∑÷º◊ü÷æ◊¢÷µ◊ì÷∂◊ü (gan- øƒí·∏èen)1, where ◊í÷∑÷º◊ü (gan) means garden, and ◊¢÷µ◊ì÷∂◊ü (\u0026lsquo;√©den) is a term that is a cognate of the Akkadian word íÇäíÅ≤íâ° (edinu or idƒ´num), which translates to desert or steppe. The Akkadian íÇäíÅ≤íâ° (idƒ´num) in turn was originally borrowed from the Sumerian term íÇî (eden), meaning plain, steppe or even open country.\nThese linguistic links suggest that the original concept of Eden might have been the name of a specific, delimited region located in a wide, open space - potentially a highly fertile plain or steppe.\nAccording to Mauro Biglino # In his book The Naked Bible author Biglino provides his interpretation of the Garden of Eden:\nBiglino suggests caution: the term ‚ÄúEden‚Äù indicates a rather precise geographical location, a vast region located between Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.\n‚ÄúIn addition to the Bible,‚Äù he explains, ‚Äúthe term ‚ÄòEden‚Äô is also found in Sumerian-Akkadian texts, where it appears as ‚ÄòE-Din‚Äô, usually translated as ‚Äòthe house of the righteous‚Äô.‚Äù And by ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù, the scholar specifies, they obviously meant ‚Äúthose of the lineage of the Commanders, meaning the biblical Elohim, who in fact correspond to the Sumerian- Akkadian Anunna or Anunnaki.‚Äù2\nBiglino posits that the term Eden refers to a distinct geographic region between Mesopotamia and the Caucasus. Drawing connections with Sumerian-Akkadian texts, he interprets \u0026ldquo;E-Din\u0026rdquo; as the \u0026ldquo;house of the righteous,\u0026rdquo; or the dwelling of biblical Elohim, equated with the Sumerian-Akkadian Anunna or Anunnaki. Biglino also points out that there are several Gans (gardens):\nTo begin with, there are many Gans in ancient books. The one pertaining to Adam and Eve, the one located in the region of Eden, was just one of several ‚Äúenclosed and protected gardens‚Äù on Earth.\n‚ÄúSo the Bible is telling us about one of the Gans existing on the planet,‚Äù confirms Biglino, ‚Äúbut we can imagine the existence of several others.‚Äù\nFor example?\n‚ÄúThe first one was probably located in the center of Africa, or in the southernmost latitudes of the black continent, where the first genetic experiments to manufacture Homo sapiens took place.3\nBiglino expands the concept of the Garden of Eden by suggesting multiple \u0026ldquo;Gans\u0026rdquo; or gardens, enclosed and protected spaces scattered across the Earth. Biglino asserts that the biblical Eden was just one of these environments. He speculates that other Gans could have existed, possibly including one in central Africa where, according to his interpretation, early genetic experiments might have led to the creation of Homo sapiens. Finally, Biglino also identifies the Gans basically being laboratories of some kind:\n‚ÄúThe Gan Eden was an experimental laboratory,‚Äù Biglino summarizes. ‚ÄúThe Elohim, the Bible tells us, produced every kind of tree that gave good edible fruit.‚Äù In that laboratory, then, they experimented with food ‚Äì both vegetable and animal ‚Äì to be used for their workers, that is to say, humanity, which they had ‚Äúcreated‚Äù through genetic engineering.4\nHe interprets the biblical \u0026ldquo;Gans\u0026rdquo; or gardens, including the Garden of Eden, as experimental laboratories. He suggests that the Elohim, or biblical creators, used these locations for scientific experiments, particularly related to their magnus opus ‚Äîhumanity.\nIn Ra√´lism üîØ # According to the The Book Which Tells The Truth, where Eden is equated with the paradise on Earth, says the following about the locality of Eden:\nThe team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.\nTheir animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call \u0026ldquo;paradise on Earth\u0026rdquo;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent.5\nIn other words, Yahweh, the one who is speaking in the passage quoted above, tells us that Eden is an antediluvian, proto-pangaean region during the that existed by the Sixth Age of Creation in the Genesis project. This region on the former Pangean continent came to what we known as the Levant after the Great Flood, or more specifically as Yahweh says himself, the land we now call Israel.\nOut of the seven creator teams, one industrious and talented team that happened to be conducting their Genesis projects within this Eden region managed to engineer outstanding life forms. Besides the supposedly impressive flora and fauna, the human type that got incepted there happened to be considered the most intelligent one.\nIn the third book, Eden is briefly mentioned again in a series of bona fide revelations:\nYahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the ‚Äúserpent‚Äù to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the ‚ÄúGarden of Eden‚Äù where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.6\nThe Garden of Eden is conceptualized as a specifically delineated, controlled environment ‚Äîakin to a laboratory‚Äî situated on the primal, antediluvian continent. Within this \u0026ldquo;fenced laboratory,\u0026rdquo; the highly skilled team of creators conducted their work, creating exceptional life forms including, most notably, the human genus.\nSee also # Wiki ‚Ä∫ Antediluvian Wiki ‚Ä∫ Pangaea Read more # Intro ‚Ä∫ Timeline ‚Ä∫ Age of Leo External links # Garden of Eden | Wikipedia Garden of Eden | Britannica Eden, Garden of. | Jewish Encyclopedia The Garden of Eden is also referred to as Garden of God (◊í÷∑÷º◊ü÷æ◊ô÷∞◊î÷π◊ï÷∂◊î, gan-YHWH and ◊í÷∑◊ü÷æ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù, gan-Elohim).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Mauro Biglino, Giorgio Cattaneo (2022): The Naked Bible: The truth about the most famous book in history, p. 102\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 103\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nidem, p. 115\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExcerpt from Ra√´l (1973): The Book Which Tells the Truth, republished in Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers (2005), p. 15.
