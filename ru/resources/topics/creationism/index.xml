This form of creation science challenges established scientific facts regarding the origins of the universe, Earth, solar system, and life itself, advocating for a literal interpretation of the biblical narratives. The film posits that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days and supports the Genesis accounts of Adam and Eve, the fall, a global flood, and the Tower of Babel.</description></item><item><title>Science After Babel</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ru/resources/science-after-babel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ru/resources/science-after-babel/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Science After Babel&amp;rdquo; by David Berlinski is a book that challenges the established norms and widely accepted theories in contemporary science. Berlinski, known for his deep learning, close reasoning, and sharp wit, critiques what he considers to be the shibboleths of modern science. These include widely accepted concepts in Darwinism, reductionism, the Standard Model of particle physics, and the idea of &amp;ldquo;talking&amp;rdquo; chimpanzees.
In his book, Berlinski questions the solidity of what is often passed off as secure scientific knowledge.</description></item><item><title>The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretension</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ru/resources/the-devils-delusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/ru/resources/the-devils-delusion/</guid><description>In &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretensions,&amp;rdquo; David Berlinski mounts a vigorous critique of scientific atheism, particularly addressing the assertions made by figures like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. Berlinski, a secular Jew and mathematician, questions the completeness and authority of science in answering profound existential and moral questions.
Berlinski argues that the science often cited by atheists to debunk religious beliefs actually does not conclusively negate the possibility of a divine existence.</description></item></channel></rss>
