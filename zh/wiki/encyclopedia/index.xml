According to the story, the people of the world were once united and spoke a single language, but after the tower was built, God confused their language and scattered them across the earth.
The story of the Tower of Babel is often interpreted as a symbol of human pride and ambition, and as a warning against trying to reach for things that are beyond our understanding and control.</description></item><item><title>比格利诺方法</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/zh/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E6%A0%BC%E5%88%A9%E8%AF%BA%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/zh/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E6%A0%BC%E5%88%A9%E8%AF%BA%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/</guid><description>Parallels with Schliemann # Heinrich Schliemann was a 19th-century German archaeologist and businessman. He is best known for his excavations at the ancient sites of Troy and Mycenae, where he claimed to have discovered the remnants of the historical cities mentioned in Greek mythology.

It seeks to understand common themes, motifs, and elements across cultures and how they evolve over time. By comparing myths from different cultures, scholars can gain insights into the cultural, historical, and psychological aspects of those cultures. This approach has been used to shed light on the origin of myths, the spread of religious and cultural ideas, and the evolution of human thought and beliefs.</description></item><item><title>传统</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/zh/wiki/%E4%BC%A0%E7%BB%9F/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/zh/wiki/%E4%BC%A0%E7%BB%9F/</guid><description>In very general terms, tradition refers to a set of beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to another, often over many centuries or even millennia.

This cycle is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s equatorial bulge. The number of 25'920 is close enough and slightly more convenient than the actual scientifically established number of 25'800 which is considered more accurate, even though it itself is as estimation derived by extrapolation.</description></item></channel></rss>
