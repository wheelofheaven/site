It narrates the adventures of Gilgamesh, the historical king of Uruk, and his quest for immortality, exploring themes of friendship, the human condition, and the fear of death. The epic, written in cuneiform on clay tablets, dates back to the early 3rd millennium BCE.
The story begins with the introduction of Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third human, who is a tyrannical king of Uruk.</description></item></channel></rss>
