It is divided into three sections: the Torah (Teaching or Law), the Nevi&amp;rsquo;im (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). The word &amp;ldquo;Tanakh&amp;rdquo; is an acronym derived from these three divisions.
The Torah (Law or Teaching): Also known as the Pentateuch, the Torah comprises the first five books of the Bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</description></item></channel></rss>
