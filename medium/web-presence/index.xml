The movement has grown to over 130,000 members across more than 120 countries. It focuses on spreading the Elohim&amp;rsquo;s message and building an embassy for them on Earth, as detailed in Rael&amp;rsquo;s teachings. This non-profit organization is funded by its members, emphasizing a vision of a world where science is paramount and violence is eradicated.</description></item></channel></rss>
