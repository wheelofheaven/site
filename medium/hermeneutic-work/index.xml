The book offers a complete and harmonious vision of the Hebrew tradition, tracing its evolution from its beginnings to the present day. Safran highlights the unity and continuity within Jewish tradition, emphasizing how divisions between law and freedom, intelligence and sensitivity, appear artificial in the context of Kabbalah.</description></item><item><title>The Zohar: Pritzker Edition</title><link>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/the-zohar-pritzker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.wheelofheaven.io/resources/the-zohar-pritzker/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The Zohar: Pritzker Edition&amp;rdquo; by Daniel Matt is a monumental translation of the Zohar, the foundational work of Jewish mysticism. This 12-volume series is the first to be translated from a critical Aramaic text, based on original manuscripts. Matt&amp;rsquo;s extensive commentary clarifies Kabbalistic symbolism and terminology, citing sources from biblical, rabbinic, and kabbalistic texts. Acclaimed for its poetic language and insightful exegesis, the translation makes the complex Zohar accessible to a wider audience, both scholarly and general.</description></item></channel></rss>
