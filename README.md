# Wheel of Heaven

Wheel of Heaven is a knowledge base exploring the working theory that life on Earth was intelligently designed by an extraterrestrial civilization, the so-called Elohim.

## Knowledge base üî¨

A knowledge base is a platform that enables the consumption of a body of knowledge that that contextualizes its units of knowledge through commentary, referencing, interlinking and formatting. This specific knowledge base is a dedicated web presence which is built with a set of best-breeds in terms of web technology. 

Thus, the Wheel of Heaven knowledge base is leveraging a static site generator that basically converts markdown based content files into a fully-fledged web site. Content creation, content editing and content organization is all managed through git-based version control hosted on [Github](https://github.com). Wheel of Heaven is composed of a collection of git-based projects, most of which are meant to be consumed through the web. An offline version is not planned as of yet.

Currently, following web projects are being hosted by Wheel of Heaven:

- [Wheel of Heaven | Knowledge Base](https://www.wheelofheaven.io/)
