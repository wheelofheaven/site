# Wheel of Heaven

Wheel of Heaven is a knowledge base exploring the working theory that life on Earth was intelligently designed by an extraterrestrial civilization, the so-called Elohim.

## Knowledge base

The knowledge base is a web presence built with a static site generator that basically converts markdown based content files into a fully-fledged web site. Content creation, content editing and content organization is all managed through git-based version control hosted on [Github](https://github.com).

Currently, following web projects are being hosted by Wheel of Heaven:

- [Wheel of Heaven | Knowledge Base](https://www.wheelofheaven.io/)
- [Wheel of Heaven | White Paper](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/WHITEPAPER.md)
